Even if many leaders of the EU are not sure that is actually possible.\\nBut she also wants to send another message back to the UK: I'm visiting the home of the global elites, maybe, but I'm here to warn businesses, not simply celebrate them.\\nThe PM said she backed globalisation and free trade, although not at any cost. And certainly not at the cost of those that feel the rich \\\"play by a different set of rules\\\" - pointing out that trust in business among those on lower incomes languishes at 35%.\\nBusiness leaders I spoke to after her speech know that Mrs May is not a fundamentalist when it comes to free markets. Yes, they work, but they need to be controlled.\\nOne cabinet minister told me recently, that the PM was very comfortable with the \\\"interventionist\\\" tag.\\nWe will hear more about that when Mrs May announces the government's industrial strategy next week.\\nOne chief executive of a global resources business worth many billions of pounds said that there was an understanding that the PM had been dealt \\\"a pretty tough hand\\\".  An exit from the EU she did not back. And the rise of a new and questioning culture of the very tenets of the globalised economic order built since the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\\n\\\"We need to get behind her,\\\" the chief executive said.\\n\\\"The decision has been made, Britain needs to be a success. Whatever you thought before the referendum, that has all changed now.\\\"\\nSo, although Mrs May's message was on the tough side for business, many firms know that the PM is the only game in town.\\nAnd as there is no alternative - to Brexit, to the rising anger of those that feel left behind - many businesses now understand that it's time to change or, as Mrs May made clear today, have that change foisted upon you by the state.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Salford Red Devils have signed powerful New Zealand winger Manu Vatuvei on a deal until the end of the 2018 season.\",\n          \"Berlin is the latest city that has suffered a \\\"terrorist attack\\\" as a man driving a lorry ploughed into people at a German Christmas market, killing 12.\",\n          \"The round of applause at the end of Theresa May's speech was shorter than for that other leader of the capitalist free world, the President of China.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"36220327\",\n          \"33639484\",\n          \"11919051\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

We are getting lapped\\\", and even praised Cuba - under a US embargo for decades - for its supply of doctors to Sierra Leone.\\nThe Pentagon announced that a new commander, Maj Gen Gary Volesky, had taken over the US military mission to fight Ebola in West Africa.\\nIt said that troops from the US 101st Division who arrived in Liberia 38 days ago had established two new laboratories and that a 25-bed hospital should be operational in the capital Monrovia by November.\\nThe US has pledged 4,000 troops to build hospitals and to train health workers in West Africa, some 600 of whom have already arrived.\\nHowever, new rules in some parts of the US on quarantining returning health workers have drawn criticism.\\nA nurse put into isolation on her return from treating patients in Sierra Leone expressed anger at the way she was dealt with at Newark airport.\\nKaci Hickox, of medical charity Doctors Without Borders, said the experience was frightening, and described seeing a \\\"frenzy of disorganisation, fear and most frightening, quarantine\\\".\\nShe said she was kept in isolation at the airport terminal for seven hours and given only a cereal bar to eat.\\nNew York, New Jersey and Illinois have imposed stricter quarantine rules than those at the federal level.\\nIn the three states, anyone who has had contact with Ebola victims in West Africa now faces a mandatory 21-day quarantine period.\\nThe White House said the states' stricter rules could put off aid workers and others travelling to West Africa to help mitigate the crisis at its source.\\nAlthough Ms Hickox tested negative in a preliminary test for the virus, she will remain under quarantine for three weeks and continue to be monitored by health officials.\\nThe stricter measures were put in place in New York and New Jersey after a doctor, Craig Spencer, tested positive for the virus on his return from Guinea last week.\\nUS President Barack Obama said in his weekly radio and online address that Americans had \\\"to be guided by the facts - not fear\\\".\\nEbola special report\\nHave you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

Even if many leaders of the EU are not sure that is actually possible.\\nBut she also wants to send another message back to the UK: I'm visiting the home of the global elites, maybe, but I'm here to warn businesses, not simply celebrate them.\\nThe PM said she backed globalisation and free trade, although not at any cost. And certainly not at the cost of those that feel the rich \\\"play by a different set of rules\\\" - pointing out that trust in business among those on lower incomes languishes at 35%.\\nBusiness leaders I spoke to after her speech know that Mrs May is not a fundamentalist when it comes to free markets. Yes, they work, but they need to be controlled.\\nOne cabinet minister told me recently, that the PM was very comfortable with the \\\"interventionist\\\" tag.\\nWe will hear more about that when Mrs May announces the government's industrial strategy next week.\\nOne chief executive of a global resources business worth many billions of pounds said that there was an understanding that the PM had been dealt \\\"a pretty tough hand\\\".  An exit from the EU she did not back. And the rise of a new and questioning culture of the very tenets of the globalised economic order built since the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\\n\\\"We need to get behind her,\\\" the chief executive said.\\n\\\"The decision has been made, Britain needs to be a success. Whatever you thought before the referendum, that has all changed now.\\\"\\nSo, although Mrs May's message was on the tough side for business, many firms know that the PM is the only game in town.\\nAnd as there is no alternative - to Brexit, to the rising anger of those that feel left behind - many businesses now understand that it's time to change or, as Mrs May made clear today, have that change foisted upon you by the state.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Salford Red Devils have signed powerful New Zealand winger Manu Vatuvei on a deal until the end of the 2018 season.\",\n          \"Berlin is the latest city that has suffered a \\\"terrorist attack\\\" as a man driving a lorry ploughed into people at a German Christmas market, killing 12.\",\n          \"The round of applause at the end of Theresa May's speech was shorter than for that other leader of the capitalist free world, the President of China.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

A total of eight homes had been evacuated.\\nPolice said they were keen to speak to anyone who could help them trace those responsible.\\nInsp David Ferguson of Corstorphine Police Station said: \\\"Thankfully no-one was seriously injured in this incident but it could have been much worse.\\n\\\"I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area around 21:00 on Sunday night and who might have information that can assist us with our inquiries.\\n\\\"I'd also like to remind residents not to leave items of furniture or rubbish in communal areas where they can be a target for fire-raising.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1600,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The US ambassador to the UN has begun a visit to the three nations worst hit by the Ebola outbreak, criticising the level of international support so far.\",\n          \"The families of three 7 July suicide bombers are still looking for answers 10 years on, an imam from their home city of Leeds has said.\",\n          \"A blaze at a block of flats in an Edinburgh housing estate was started deliberately, police believe.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Even if many leaders of the EU are not sure that is actually possible.\\nBut she also wants to send another message back to the UK: I'm visiting the home of the global elites, maybe, but I'm here to warn businesses, not simply celebrate them.\\nThe PM said she backed globalisation and free trade, although not at any cost. And certainly not at the cost of those that feel the rich \\\"play by a different set of rules\\\" - pointing out that trust in business among those on lower incomes languishes at 35%.\\nBusiness leaders I spoke to after her speech know that Mrs May is not a fundamentalist when it comes to free markets. Yes, they work, but they need to be controlled.\\nOne cabinet minister told me recently, that the PM was very comfortable with the \\\"interventionist\\\" tag.\\nWe will hear more about that when Mrs May announces the government's industrial strategy next week.\\nOne chief executive of a global resources business worth many billions of pounds said that there was an understanding that the PM had been dealt \\\"a pretty tough hand\\\".  An exit from the EU she did not back. And the rise of a new and questioning culture of the very tenets of the globalised economic order built since the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\\n\\\"We need to get behind her,\\\" the chief executive said.\\n\\\"The decision has been made, Britain needs to be a success. Whatever you thought before the referendum, that has all changed now.\\\"\\nSo, although Mrs May's message was on the tough side for business, many firms know that the PM is the only game in town.\\nAnd as there is no alternative - to Brexit, to the rising anger of those that feel left behind - many businesses now understand that it's time to change or, as Mrs May made clear today, have that change foisted upon you by the state.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Salford Red Devils have signed powerful New Zealand winger Manu Vatuvei on a deal until the end of the 2018 season.\",\n          \"Berlin is the latest city that has suffered a \\\"terrorist attack\\\" as a man driving a lorry ploughed into people at a German Christmas market, killing 12.\",\n          \"The round of applause at the end of Theresa May's speech was shorter than for that other leader of the capitalist free world, the President of China.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

              "\"But unfortunately, fossil fuels represent over 70% of the fuel that's consumed in the world and the idea that you can get rid of that in any meaningful sense is a pipe dream.\"\n",

              "Using the carbon dioxide as a so-called working fluid - used to make the turbine function - it would pass through the system in a loop, to be recycled and used again.\n",

              "In addition, Net Power believes its technology would be cheaper to operate than current power stations.\n",
              "Mr Allam says: \"It was my ambition to create a cycle which would be cheaper - or at least as cheap - as existing technology without CO2 capture, and yet go for 100% CO2 capture.\"\n",
              "The system is geared to enable a process called carbon capture and storage (CCS), which would see the excess carbon dioxide from the fuel combustion funnelled into a pipeline or a tanker instead of being released into the air.\n",
              "Mr Allam says that because the whole cycle happens at a high pressure of about 320 atmospheres, the gas emerges with a pressure and level of purity that is \"capture ready\" - or ideal for storage.\n",
              "This is different from the carbon dioxide produced by other kinds of power plants, which is mixed with gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide.\n",

              "Another option would see the gas put on a ship and taken to the North Sea to be used for a process called enhanced oil recovery, where the gas is pumped deep underground into oil fields where most of the oil has already been extracted.\n",
              "Because of the way carbon dioxide swells when it mixes with oil, it can be used to push the oil out of places that are hard to reach, getting more out of an existing basin.\n",

              "However, prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to mount a criminal prosecution.\n",
              "A year later, a coroner had to indefinitely adjourn an inquest into Mr Rodney's death because neither he nor a jury were allowed to look at secret material relating to how the arrest operation came about because of rules relating to criminal intelligence.\n",
              "It was announced in 2010 an inquiry would be allowed to look at all the evidence - but some of it would not be made public.\n",
              "Chairman Sir Christopher Holland, a retired High Court judge, was tasked with determining how, when, where and in what circumstances Mr Rodney had died.\n",
              "During the inquiry, it was revealed Mr Long had previously shot dead two men during a police incident in 1987 as he feared they were about to shoot a security driver during a heist in Plumstead, south-east London.\n",
              "Inquests into the men's deaths later found they had been lawfully killed and Mr Long received a commendation from the Met Police Commissioner for his conduct.\n",
              "It has also emerged that in 1985, during a siege, Mr Long opened fire twice and injured a kidnapper to rescue a four-year-old girl.\n",
              "In the 1990s, he received a commander's commendation for his conduct in an armed stand-off with a gunman in a minicab office\n",
              "However, the Azelle Rodney inquiry found there was \"no lawful justification\" for Mr Long to open fire in April 2005.\n",
              "Sir Christopher went as far to say that Mr Long \"could not rationally have believed\" Mr Rodney had picked up a sub-machine gun.\n",
              "Lawyers for Mr Long said the inquiry's findings were \"irrational\" and they went to the High Court to seek permission for a judicial review over the inquiry's conclusions, but the Queen's Bench Division ruled there was \"no value in granting permission\".\n",
              "The IPCC referred the matter back to the CPS and following an investigation Mr Long was charged with murder in July 2014, which he denied.\n",
              "Throughout the trial, the prosecution maintained Mr Long had fired \"extremely quickly\", opening fire 0.06 seconds after the police car stopped alongside the vehicle containing Mr Rodney.\n",

Even if many leaders of the EU are not sure that is actually possible.\\nBut she also wants to send another message back to the UK: I'm visiting the home of the global elites, maybe, but I'm here to warn businesses, not simply celebrate them.\\nThe PM said she backed globalisation and free trade, although not at any cost. And certainly not at the cost of those that feel the rich \\\"play by a different set of rules\\\" - pointing out that trust in business among those on lower incomes languishes at 35%.\\nBusiness leaders I spoke to after her speech know that Mrs May is not a fundamentalist when it comes to free markets. Yes, they work, but they need to be controlled.\\nOne cabinet minister told me recently, that the PM was very comfortable with the \\\"interventionist\\\" tag.\\nWe will hear more about that when Mrs May announces the government's industrial strategy next week.\\nOne chief executive of a global resources business worth many billions of pounds said that there was an understanding that the PM had been dealt \\\"a pretty tough hand\\\".  An exit from the EU she did not back. And the rise of a new and questioning culture of the very tenets of the globalised economic order built since the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.\\n\\\"We need to get behind her,\\\" the chief executive said.\\n\\\"The decision has been made, Britain needs to be a success. Whatever you thought before the referendum, that has all changed now.\\\"\\nSo, although Mrs May's message was on the tough side for business, many firms know that the PM is the only game in town.\\nAnd as there is no alternative - to Brexit, to the rising anger of those that feel left behind - many businesses now understand that it's time to change or, as Mrs May made clear today, have that change foisted upon you by the state.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3999,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Salford Red Devils have signed powerful New Zealand winger Manu Vatuvei on a deal until the end of the 2018 season.\",\n          \"Berlin is the latest city that has suffered a \\\"terrorist attack\\\" as a man driving a lorry ploughed into people at a German Christmas market, killing 12.\",\n          \"The round of applause at the end of Theresa May's speech was shorter than for that other leader of the capitalist free world, the President of China.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The director and an actor said they are \"disturbed\" by the video.\\nBut the film's producer and distributor deny the dog was mishandled and say it is \"happy and healthy\".\\nA Dog's Purpose, starring Dennis Quaid, is billed as \"a celebration of the special connection between humans and their dogs\".\\nBut the minute-long 2015 video from the Winnipeg movie set posted online appears to show a dog in distress.\\nIn the video, a man can be overheard saying: \"Don't worry, it's warm water at least. He ain't going to calm down until he goes in the water. Just got to throw him in.\"\\nThe dog, a German Shepherd called Hercules, appears terrified and is seen struggling and clawing the side of the pool as his handler pushes him into the water.\\nAnimal rights groups have expressed outrage.\\nOne organisation, Animal Justice, is alleging violations of federal and provincial laws.\\nIt has filed cruelty complaints with the Winnipeg Humane Society, the Chief Veterinary Office of Manitoba and the Winnipeg Police.\\nThe Winnipeg Humane Society says it was consulted for two scenes in the film.\\n\"This dog was fearful and not properly trained for this experience,\" the organisation's chief executive said in a statement.\\n\"Training for a scene like this should take place weeks - if not months - in advance to help a dog get comfortable with not only being in water of that depth, but also the turbulence.\"\\nAmerican Humane, the organisation that oversees animal safety during filming, said it was investigating the incident and had suspended its representative who was on the set.\\nThe film's producer, Amblin Entertainment, and distributor, Universal Pictures, said Hercules was properly treated on set.\\nIn a joint statement released late on Wednesday, they say that \"great care and concern\" was shown for the German Shepherd and other dogs featured in the film.\\nThey also suggested that the TMZ footage was edited, saying there was several days of rehearsals for the water scenes to ensure the dog was comfortable with the shoot.\\n\"On the day of the shoot, Hercules did not want to perform the stunt portrayed on the tape so the Amblin production team did not proceed with filming that shot,\" the statement said.\\nThe film's director Lasse Hallstrom, who is known for What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Chocolat, expressed concern over the footage on Twitter.\\n\"I am very disturbed by the video released today from the set of my film A Dog's Purpose,\" he said, denying TMZ's report that he had witnessed the incident.\\n\"I have been promised that a thorough investigation into this situation is underway and that any wrongdoing will be reported and punished.\"\\nActor Josh Gad, who voices the dog in the film, said he was \"shaken and sad\" after seeing the video.</td>\n",
