The trial was told Mrs King's severe dementia had worsened in the months before her death and her husband had Alzheimer's and another mental health condition called paraphrenia which affected his ability to form judgements.
King, of Cedar Close, Walton-on-the-Naze, denied murder at an earlier hearing, but pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.
During the trial, the jury heard King also considered shooting his older sister Eileen, who is a resident at the care home, as well as himself.
Mr King was sentenced to six years for manslaughter, five years for firearm possession and 12 months for possessing ammunition. All three terms will be served concurrently.
The judge ordered he be treated for his mental health condition at a secure hospital unit in Northampton.
Consultant psychiatrist James Warner said paraphrenia was an older person's version of schizophrenia in which people lose contact with reality.",An 87-year-old man who shot his wife dead at a care home has been sentenced to six years in prison.
"Scottish winger Matt Williams' early touchdown caused shudders round a soaking wet Sixways.
But the home side responded with four tries, allied to 18 points from the boot of stand-off Ryan Lamb.
Flanker Sam Lewis scored a hat-trick of tries, while winger Dean Hammond also crossed the whitewash.
Lamb kicked three of his four conversion attempts, as well as two key first-half penalties - and two more late in the game.
Full-back Peter Lydon got the Exiles' other try, which he converted, along with a first-half penalty for a 10-point haul.
Scottish trailed by five points from Saturday's first leg, only for that advantage to be wiped out inside the first six minutes.
Jamie Stevenson's blindside run set up right wing Williams to score in the corner.
But that turned out to be the nearest this contest got to a Scottish gain as Warriors eventually rallied and started to tick the right boxes.
Two Lamb penalties in the space of three minutes were followed by a Sam Lewis pushover try in the left corner, from which Lamb was also successful with the conversion.
Peter Lydon did reduce the deficit at the interval to 13-8 with a penalty, but two tries in four minutes at the start of the second half killed the contest.
All Blacks winger Cooper Vuna, switched to full-back following an early injury to Ben Howard, set up Hammond, converted by Lamb before Lewis crashed over in the right corner, from which Lamb missed his first kick of the night.
Lydon converted his own try to bring it back to 25-15 on the night, before Lewis's third try, again converted by Lamb.
Lamb landed two more penalties before injury-weakened Warriors brought the biggest roar of the night with the late introduction of 17-year-old schoolboy Jamie Shillcock at scrum-half.

"Joe Lawton, 17, shot himself at his family farm in Greater Manchester two days after his arrest.
His parents, Nick and Jane Lawton, are urging the Government to change the law, which says 17 year-olds are not children in custody.
The Home Office believes current laws are adequate.
Joe was arrested when police stopped him as he drove his new car home from a party last August.
He was kept overnight at Cheadle Heath police station in Greater Manchester without his parents' knowledge because he was not classed as a child.
Two days later he took his own life, using a shotgun from the family farm. The police charge sheet was at his feet when his father found him.
Joe's parents believe they could have given him more support had they been able to see him in a police cell.
In a statement on the change.org website, Mr and Mrs Lawton said: ""He was just 17 and had made a bad decision to drive home after a party. Two days later Joe took his own life.
""We were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed.""
They added: ""The fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult whilst in custody is an anomaly of British law.  Once they are charged they are then treated as children. This simply does not make sense.""
""We believe if the law had been different Joe would still be alive.""
A Home Office spokesman said: ""We believe the laws in place ensure the appropriate level of care for everyone, including 17-year-olds.""",The parents of a boy who killed himself after being arrested for drink-driving arrest are calling for 17-year-olds to be treated as children in custody.

"It said such a move would ""reduce the burden"" on passengers who could instead go to claims companies which would take a cut of any payouts.
Hundreds of flights were grounded by last Saturday's IT problems.
BA said that it had ""no desire to be obstructive"" and would fully honour its compensation obligations.
The problems, which continued throughout last weekend, disrupted the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers around the world.
Under EU law, passengers can claim compensation from BA for travel disruption, worth up to 600 euros (Â£524).
They can also claim expenses for items such as hotels, meals and phone calls - a matter that led to a dispute with insurers during the week.
Which? said the airline sector was out of step with other service industries.
In a letter to BA chief executive Alex Cruz, Alex Neill from Which? wrote: ""You have 'profusely' apologised to passengers, many of whom have had their holidays ruined, and have 'committed' to following the rules on compensation.
""This does not go far enough and is simply not good enough. You have failed your customers once and are in grave danger of doing it again.
""By simplifying the compensation process, you have an opportunity to minimise the additional stress and inconvenience you cause your customers and ensure they are not pushed into the arms of claims management companies, who will take a large part of the money they are owed.
""British Airways can, and should, seek to automatically issue statutory compensation to all affected passengers.
""This would reduce the burden on passengers and mean they get back what they are legally entitled to quicker.
""It would also allow you to focus on dealing with the individual additional expenses incurred by affected passengers on a case-by-case basis.
""Disruptions like last weekend only highlight that it is time for all airlines to introduce measures so that, where possible, passengers are compensated automatically for delays and cancellations.""
A BA spokeswoman said: ""We sincerely apologise for the difficulties and frustration customers faced during the huge disruption across the bank holiday weekend.
""We will fully honour our EU compensation obligations and have set up a link on the home page of our website to enable customers to submit their claims as quickly and conveniently as possible.
""We have no desire to be obstructive in any way and have put additional resources into our call centres to process claims as speedily as possible.""
According to one comparison website, an estimated 70% of all airline customers who have a right to a payout do not claim.
Virgin became the first rail company to automatically compensate some train passengers if they are delayed.
Travellers using its services on the West Coast main line - and who book their tickets via the company app or website - receive automatic repayments.
Communications regulator Ofcom is also investigating the use of automatic compensation when phone or internet services fail.
At present, customers tend to go through one of two ombudsman services.","British Airways should automatically compensate thousands of customers who were caught up in disruption last weekend, says consumer group Which?"
"Recep Tayyip Erdogan said voters had chosen stability following unrest.
With almost all ballots counted, state-run Anadolu news agency said the AKP had won 49.4% of the vote, with the main opposition CHP on 25.4%.
European observers have criticised the government for stifling media freedom.
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said violence, especially in the country's south-east, had also had a significant impact on the election.
Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) went further and denounced the entire process as ""unfair"".
President Erdogan hailed the result early on Monday, saying: ""The national will manifested itself on 1 November in favour of stability.""
But he also attacked media criticism of him and called for global recognition of the election result.
""Now a party with some 50% [of the vote] in Turkey has attained power... This should be respected by the whole world, but I have not seen such maturity.""

Lira strengthens after result
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu will now begin the process of forming a new government.
Mr Erdogan called the second general election this year after his AKP lost its parliamentary majority for the first time in 13 years in June and attempts to form a coalition failed.
The pro-Kurdish HDP crossed the 10% threshold needed to claim seats in parliament, but it got 21 fewer MPs than in June's election.
The nationalist MHP's share of the vote also declined, to 11.9%, and commentators suggested it had lost voters to the AKP.
Reported results also showed:
Clashes were reported in the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir, in the south-east of Turkey, as the results were being counted. Reuters said police had fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones.
Since elections in June, a ceasefire between the Turkish army and militants from the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) has collapsed.
Critics have accused Mr Erdogan of renewing violence to curb support for the HDP - something the government denies.
In a statement on Monday, Ignacio Sanchez Amor, head of the OSCE observer mission, said: ""Physical attacks on party members, as well as the significant security concerns, particularly in the south-east... imposed restrictions on the ability to campaign.""
He added that pressure on journalists - including a police raid on the Koza-Ipek media group in Istanbul last week - was a major concern.
Meanwhile Andreas Gross, head of the PACE delegation, said: ""Unfortunately, the campaign for these elections was characterised by unfairness and, to a serious degree, fear.""
HDP co-chair Selahattin Demirtas said on Sunday that it had not been ""a fair or equal election"".
The party suspended campaigning after a bombing in Ankara last month killed more than 100 people. The government said the attackers were linked to the Islamic State (IS) group.
Violence has escalated in Turkey since a suicide bombing in July by suspected IS militants.
The attack near the border with Syria killed more than 30 Kurds.
Turkish newspaper front pages reflect the contrasting euphoria and gloom from government supporters and opponents at the election result.

"The England striker, 23, came through United's famed youth system but joined the Gunners for £16m on deadline day.
United brought striker Radamel Falcao on a £6m loan deal from Monaco, their sixth signing of the transfer window.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""They have probably lost the way of Manchester United a little bit,"" Phelan told BBC Sport.
""Now, rather than produce, it may be the case where they are buying in.
""Someone like a Danny Welbeck has been part of United's identity and that has been broken.
""What will happen in the future now, nobody knows but that thread has been broken now.""
Former United midfielder David Beckham said he was sad to see Welbeck leave, but is hopeful promising players will continue to be developed under new manager Louis van Gaal.
""Manchester United have always bought players in but also have had a great scouting system which Sir Alex Ferguson put in quite a few years ago, where we did create home-grown talent, and that is something we have done over the years,"" said the former England captain.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""I think Louis van Gaal is a talented manager, he is well respected and with Manchester United this is a project that will hopefully last for a few years and be a successful one.
""Hopefully we have still got young players coming through.""
For many years United had a strong core of home-grown youth players under former boss Ferguson, with the renowned 'Class  of 92' - which included Beckham, Paul Scholes and Phil and Gary Neville - coming through the ranks.
As well as Colombian Falcao, new boss Van Gaal has also brought in Angel Di Maria for a British-record £59.7m, midfielder Ander Herrera for £29m from Athletic Bilbao, left-back Luke Shaw in a £27m move from Southampton, the £16m Marcos Rojo from Sporting Lisbon and midfielder Daley Blind from Ajax for £13.8m.
Meanwhile, United youngsters Tom Lawrence, Nick Powell and Michael Keane left on Monday, either on loan or permanently.
However, defender Tyler Blackett, a youth academy product, has played in the Premier League this season, while defender Reece James and goalkeeper Ben Amos have been included in the matchday squad.
But Phelan, who was Ferguson's assistant between 2008 and 2013, believes the big-money arrivals at Old Trafford could suggest a change of philosophy at the club.
""There is always the start of something and maybe this is the start of a new way of doing things at Manchester United and maybe that is the way football is going,"" he added.
""Is it better to look at the instant rather than the future? It is a difficult one because youth is always the future, we all have to start somewhere and you just hope that product of youth can develop in the Premier League.""
Phelan expects Arsenal to give Welbeck the chance to flourish after finding his chances limited at United.
Gunners boss Arsene Wenger already has a number of England internationals in his squad, with Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott, Kieran Gibbs and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all first-team regulars when fit.
England squad member Calum Chambers was signed in the summer from Southampton and the defender has made three Premier League appearances this season.
""He is still only a young player and with young players you will get peaks and troughs but it is a case of Danny feeling more important in himself than he probably was over the last 12 months,"" added Phelan.
""He is in a position where he can play where he wants and I think that is why he chose Arsenal because they give him the opportunity to play in his best position, which is a striker.""","Former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan feels part of the club's ""identity has been broken"" with Danny Welbeck's departure to Arsenal."
"Thomas Scanlon, 23, attacked Jamie Bagnall with a piece of wood at a flat in Pensarn near Rhyl, Denbighshire, Mold Crown Court heard.
Scanlon, of no fixed abode but who had lived at Rhos-on-Sea, admitted wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm.
On Monday, he was jailed for four-and-a-half years.
Prosecuting barrister James Coutts said Scanlon was in a relationship with Mr Bagnall's sister. It was accepted Mr Bagnall had stolen an iPad from her, and the defendant had made a threat to ""get"" him.
The court heard that after the attack in March 2015, he posted the photograph of Mr Bagnall cowering on the floor on Facebook with a caption which read ""I am sorry, ha, ha, ha"".
Mr Bagnall, who has since moved to the Manchester area, needed surgery, had severe injuries including four deep cuts to the head and an injury to his elbow.
Owen Edwards, defending, said he appreciated that he had got himself into a huge amount of trouble.
Judge Niclas Parry told him: ""This was a revenge attack - a total over-reaction to a dispute between you and Mr Bagnall.""
A 10-year restraining order was made preventing him from contacting Mr Bagnall.",A man who attacked another man in a row over a stolen iPad and then posted a photograph of his injured victim on social media has been jailed.
"Ronan O'Mahony and James Cronin both notched two tries with Tommy O'Donnell and the Scannell brothers Niall and Rory also touching down for Munster.
Derick Minnie scored a first-half try for Zebre as Munster led 24-7 at the break with Lloyd Greeff also scoring for the Pro12's bottom club in Parma.
The Italian club have lost 16 of their 17 Pro12 matches this season.
Ireland hooker Niall Scannell finished off a maul to open Munster's account in the third minute before his fellow international O'Donnell extended the lead on 18 minutes.
After wing O'Mahony's first try, Minnie replied for Zebre on the half-hour mark before a Tyler Bleyendaal penalty left Munster 17 points clear at half-time.
Munster centre Scannell joined his older brother on the scoreboard with the first try of the second half to ensure his side a bonus point, before O'Mahony secured his brace after Marcello Violi was sin-binned for the hosts.
Despite their numerical disadvantage, Zebre reduced the deficit to 12 points through a converted try from South African Greeff with just under 25 minutes to play.

"Police said the 61-year-old man had left his own vehicle when he was struck by the lorry shortly after 13:00. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
The eastbound carriageway was closed at Junction 3 while emergency services attended, but has since reopened.
Police said they were attempting to establish the full circumstances of the incident.",A man has died after being hit by a lorry on the M8 at Livingston in West Lothian.
"He was playing against opponents who, earlier that season, had wound him up so badly that it completely put him off his game. Players who 24 hours earlier had spoken to a newspaper to explain, in detail, how this imposter was going to be stopped.
The supporters didn't like him. Nothing was going right.
And then, taking possession 40 yards out, Ibrahimovic explodes.
A dart forward. The acceleration beginning. A quick stepover, round one opponent, speed increasing. Another stepover. Outside another, back inside the same man as he tries to recover and then a shot into the bottom corner from 18 yards.
""He could have passed,"" recalled one of the opponents he had left trailing in his wake. ""But he had read the article. It was as if he was saying, 'Forget it guys. It's me'.""
Ibrahimovic was not finished. Initial glee, wide smile, on bended knee, waving an arm in mock celebration to show how easy it was. Then something else, more serious, a point to be made. A cup-eared celebration, blowing kisses to the crowd who were already in a state of fury.
He was 19.
The goal is well known among Swedish fans. The reaction to it new.
It is part of a documentary 'Becoming Zlatan' to be released in August that contains remarkable archive footage of Ibrahimovic's early years at Malmo.
Getting such close access at an early stage of his career was sheer good fortune for brothers Fredrik and Magnus Gertten, who shot the footage in 2000 and 2001 as part of a film intended to show the conflict between young and older players at their beloved Malmo.
They needed a focus for each side of the debate. They had heard of Ibrahimovic and approached him.
""The way he saw it, of course we should make a documentary him,"" said  Fredrik.
""It suited his self image. He was only 17 but he had a very strong confidence that he would make it because he had something special.""
Manchester United's newest recruit has a reputation for saying what he thinks.
Numerous times in recent weeks he refused to say where he was going, even though his destination after leaving Paris St-Germain was obvious. Instead he said he amused himself by reading what was being written and would eventually let everyone know, at a time of his choosing.
He meant it. When he posted United's badge on Instagram, he even beat his new club to the news by 24 hours.
""We are not part of the football world,"" said Gertten. ""Our business is making social and political films. Our initial experience of dealing with footballers was that nothing of them ever comes out in what they say. Their words are controlled, boring, nothing.
""Zlatan was different. Here was a young guy who said interesting things, very honest things about himself and his emotions. It was so fresh. It made you feel warm towards him.
""The problem is people don't always like honesty. When someone says what they think it can be painful.""
His Croatian mother and hard-drinking Bosnian father were divorced and Ibrahimovic lived with the latter on the outskirts of town, moving regularly to earn the nickname 'gypsy',
His talent was honed on a small shale pitch outside his mum's flat. For him, football was, has been and remains fun.
As a teenager with Malmo, rather than simply beating opponents much older, he preferred balancing the ball on his foot and lifting it past them. To supporters it is magical. To opponents infuriating.
""I am just teasing,"" he said. ""If it's not fun it's not worth playing.""
Such arrogance does not come without a downside... there were times in his youth when Ibrahimovic seemed unmanageable.
Here was a kid, accepted by football people at Malmo as having the capability to become the best they had ever had, whose behaviour was so bad, even in the notoriously flexible world of football conduct, he nearly ended up without a club.
School was missed, regularly. He would spark fights in training with his poor discipline. It was the same in matches.
""He simply did not obey the rules,"" said Gertten.
""There was a really complex aura around him. He was over the top, aggressive. He did dirty things. Parts of the Malmo board wanted to kick him out of the club.""
When his mum and dad split, Ibrahimovic went to live with his dad, Sefik. His sister stayed with his mum.
The finer points of parenting were lost to Sefik. Frequently, there was beer in the fridge but no food.
In the documentary, Ibrahimovic explains with pride how he has learned to cook and fend for himself, all apart from his laundry, which he still took to his mum.
Yet, despite the hardship, the bond with his father is strong. The need to please obvious.
Remarkably though, Ibrahimovic's mum only found out her son was moving from Malmo to Ajax for a club record 8.7m euros in 2001 after seeing it on a television report. The teenager had asked his dad what he thought of the Dutch giants, but kept the news that discussions had already taken place a secret.
""There is a mystery around Zlatan which is hiding some part of him,"" said Gertten.
""It goes back to his childhood. You still love your mum and dad but the child who has a problem at home normally doesn't want to talk about it because they are trying to protect their family.
""His dad didn't watch him often but you could see what it meant to Zlatan any time he did.
""But his childhood also meant he had to make his own rules. He didn't have the same integration in society as others.""
If Ibrahimovic likes someone, the bond endures. However, if feelings go the other way, the dislike lingers.
Leo Beenhakker was the technical director at Ajax who took a chance on the Swede, and Ibrahimovic has never forgotten it.
Louis van Gaal followed him into the job. Ibrahimovic did not like it, or him. It is why, had Van Gaal remained at Old Trafford, there was no chance the 34-year-old would have moved to United.
Jose Mourinho (Inter Milan) good. Pep Guardiola (Barcelona) bad.
""If you treat him with respect he will treat you with respect,"" said Gertten. ""If you don't he will be a complicated man for you.""
Ibrahimovic's loyalty is underlined by the well-documented scissor-throwing incident involving Mido at Ajax in 2003.
After a defeat at PSV Eindhoven, the two got into an argument after Ibrahimovic accused Mido of not passing. In the heated exchange, the Egyptian, who had been cutting the tape from his socks, threw a pair of scissors which narrowly missed the side of the Swede's head.
Within 10 minutes, all had been forgiven and the pair were joking about it in a jacuzzi.
Ibrahimovic was the first person to publicly speak out for his friend. ""I made mistakes in Sweden,"" he said. ""It's a new day. You become older. You grow up.""
And then, to the television journalist posing the questions, he said: ""Have you made mistakes? Nobody is talking about them because you are only a reporter.""
We know so much about Ibrahimovic. But what do we really know?
In the documentary, as a teenager in Sweden, he speaks often about his girlfriend and the life they will have together in the Netherlands. She also thinks that is how it will be. Yet when he went to Amsterdam, she was hardly ever spotted at Ajax and one day he announced, glibly, that they had split.
Long hours were spent alone at his house in a small suburb of the Dutch capital - the kind of place perfect for a young family but completely at odds with the wild child image growing around him.
""I met him a lot during those early years,"" said Gertten.
""In the same year as Ibrahimovic made his debut for Malmo, the papers started with specialist sports sections. He was born for that. There were Zlatan headlines every week for a whole year even though Malmo were in the second division.
""In the beginning he was really flattered but suddenly the newspapers were doing conflict stories.
""When he got his driving licence he went to the area where the prostitutes were and pretended to be the police and scared away the customers. It was a practical joke. But it got headlines. That was shocking for him. He was upset about it.""
It is many years since Gertten and Ibrahimovic spoke. The player's advisors were told of the documentary. They did not obstruct its making, neither have they assisted.
The material, 15 years old, has been sifted through meticulously, most of it didn't make the cut. What did is compelling.
""I once read a book by a researcher who did work with kids who ticked all the boxes for someone who would go to prison,"" said Gertten. ""With the ones who didn't, one of the things that saved them was the ability to create positive emotions.
""In that sense, Zlatan's smile has been a lifesaver. The warmth that comes out of that smile makes people want to help him. They forgive him things that weren't too smart. That smile has a magic. It is really strong with him. He can turn everything around with a smile.""

"To give some idea of the amount of the currency that represents - there were more than 90 billion banknotes in circulation in India last March.
Most central banks destroy soiled and mutilated banknotes on a regular basis and replace them with new, crisp ones.
The Reserve Bank of India, similarly, shreds such notes and makes briquettes of them. But they are not your usual briquettes.
Briquettes - usually made of farm waste in India - are used for cooking, lighting and heating. They are cheaper than coal, have lower ash content, are less polluting, and easier to store and pack. They are mostly used as fuel in factory boilers.
But briquettes made out of shredded cash are brittle and serve no such purpose, a senior central bank official told me.
So the bank's 27 shredding and briquetting machines in 19 offices across India will now snip the expired banknotes into the smallest of pieces and the resulting briquettes will be then dumped in India's vast landfills.
Sometimes the shredded currency is also recycled to make files, calendars and paper weights and ballpoint pen shells, tea coasters, cups and small trays as souvenirs for guests.
The practice is similar in the US: counterfeit banknotes are sent to the Secret Service, while unfit notes are shredded and sent to landfills or given away as souvenirs to the public touring the Federal Reserve Bank.
Central bank officials believe shredding 20 billion banknotes will not be a huge challenge. In 2015-16 the Reserve Bank of India destroyed more than 16 billion soiled notes. More than 14 billion were removed in 2012-2013 after nearly 500,000 fake notes were found in the system.
""Destroying so much cash is not a challenge because we have enough shredding and briquetting machines with very high capacities. These are automatic machines which shred the cash into the finest of pieces,"" says an official.  So, India's mountain of expired currency will soon become rubbish, literally.","India's central bank will have to destroy, by one estimate, some 20 billion ""expired"" banknotes after it scrapped two high-value denominations - the 500 ($7.60) and 1,000 rupee notes - this month to crack down on ""black money"" or illegal cash holdings."

"Many researchers thought ministers would sit on this controversial issue. Instead, the chief medical officer, Professor Dame Sally Davies, has announced that draft regulations will be published within months.
She predicts that couples affected by mitochondrial disease could benefit from the treatment within two years, enabling them to have healthy children.
So why is this such a significant moment?
Firstly the UK will become the first country to allow the technique, aimed at preventing a range of potentially deadly genetic disorders.
This will underline Britain's pioneering role in genetics and IVF stretching back to both the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 and the birth of Louise Brown, the world's first test tube baby, in 1978.
Secondly, the technique itself will result in babies with DNA from three people - two women and a man - and this genetic alteration will be passed down the generations.
Once babies have been born using this technique, there will be no going back. A permanent and novel genetic change to members of the human race will have been made.
That might sound pretty worrying, and talk of three people's DNA mixed together seems a bit ghoulish at first glance.  So is this science overstepping the mark?
A public consultation conducted by the fertility regulator, the HFEA, found there was broad support for the technique, once the details had been explained.
So let's look briefly at the science.
Mitochondria are the energy factories of cells. They contain a tiny bit of DNA and just 37 genes, sitting outside the nucleus which has more than 20,000 genes - including all the crucial genetic material from both parents.
Mitochondrial disorders are always passed down the maternal line in the egg, so the technique being pioneered by Prof Doug Turnbull and his team at Newcastle University involves using healthy donor eggs.
Put briefly, conventional IVF is performed and then, after fertilisation, the pro-nuclei of the father and mother - you can see them clearly as the two round balls inside the glass tube in the picture above - are sucked out of the developing embryo.
This leaves behind the faulty mitochondria. The parents' genetic material is then injected into a healthy donor egg which has had its pro-nuclei removed but still has healthy mitochondria.
The scientists believe the resulting embryo should develop normally. It means all the crucial parental genes will be retained, plus a tiny amount of DNA from the female donor.
So how much DNA from the second woman is there? There is 1.05 metres of DNA in the nucleus and 0.0054 mm of DNA in our mitochondria.
Let's put that another way.  If you imagine the DNA in your nucleus - remember this is all the important stuff which makes us what we are - and stretched it from Trafalgar Square to Prof Turnbull's laboratory in Newcastle, you'd have a double helix of 282 miles.
Now if you laid all the DNA from the mitochondria alongside it, it would stretch from Trafalgar Square, barely round the corner to the National Portrait Gallery - just a couple of hundred yards.  That perhaps gives you an idea of just how little DNA is involved.
The scientists in Newcastle say their technique is akin to changing the battery of a laptop computer. The hard-drive - containing all the important information - is the parental DNA in the nucleus which remains unchanged. The battery is simply the power source.
Animal research and a number of scientific reviews suggest the technique is safe. But the Newcastle team reckon they have another year or more research to do before they will be completely satisfied.
One limiting factor for the researchers is the shortage of healthy donor eggs. They need women in the Newcastle area who are prepared to altruistically donate their eggs.
Another team in Oregon is using a similar technique and is discussing future research with the American regulators.
The next step here will be the publication of draft regulations.
There will be a debate and a free vote in parliament. A final scientific review of safety will be made and then assuming all hurdles have been passed, it will be open to the Newcastle team to apply for a licence from the HFEA. Each case, each couple being treated, will require a separate licence.
But before then, further public debate is being actively encouraged - this is an occasion where science, ethics and regulation seem to be proceeding at the same pace.
There will be some who find this disturbing - tampering with nature. But for the families affected by mitochondrial disease it is a chance to have a healthy child, and to ensure that future generations are healthy too.
We may look back on this development as one of the key moments in science and ethics of modern times.",The decision of the government to support a ground-breaking technique for preventing serious genetic disease is a bold step for science and society.
"A man was arrested after the fires at Wasserstein and police suspect arson. No-one in the hostels was badly hurt.
More than a million refugees and migrants have arrived in Germany this year, and for most their first stop has been in Bavaria.
President Joachim Gauck devoted his Christmas message to the recent influx.
""We have shown what we are capable of, in terms of good will and professionalism, but also in the art of improvisation,"" he said, praising fellow Germans for their response to the crisis.
But he also called for the full force of the law to be used against anyone using violence against the new arrivals.
""Arson and attacks on defenceless people deserve our contempt and deserve punishment,"" the president said.
Refugee hostels in Germany have come under more than 200 attacks this year alone, according to research by Die Zeit newspaper, but the authorities have secured convictions against only a handful of attackers.
Migrant crisis explained in maps and graphics
Germany's 'historic test' - Merkel
Reports of Merkel's demise are greatly exaggerated
Year of the migrant - a crisis unlike all others
Chancellor Angela Merkel promised last week that Germany would ""noticeably reduce the number of refugees"" in response to criticism from within her centre-right CDU party.
Up to 40% of arrivals in Germany have come from Balkan countries such as Albania and Kosovo which are considered safe. Most of the other arrivals are refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
European countries have struggled to cope with the large number of people reaching the shores of the EU. This week, international migration officials said more than a million ""irregular"" migrants and refugees had come by land and sea, the vast majority via Greece.
Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka singled out Mrs Merkel for blame for sending out a signal across the Middle East and Africa which ""stimulated illegal migration to Europe"".
UN refugee officials say 3,716 people died or went missing this year as they tried to cross into Europe.
But there was good news for one Afghan family who feared their 10-year-son had drowned off the Turkish coast.
The Rabani family, who have since arrived in the German state of Lower Saxony, became separated from their son as they boarded a boat in Turkey. His boat capsized and many of those on board drowned.
A German Red Cross official eventually succeeded in tracking down the child, who was found staying at a refugee hostel in Switzerland. The family hope to be reunited in a few weeks' time.
In a separate development, a young Palestinian refugee who made headlines in July when she cried in front of Mrs Merkel has reportedly been told by German immigration officials that she and her family will be able to stay in the country until 2017.
Reem Sahwil, 14, had told the chancellor on live TV that she wanted to go to university but she burst into tears when the chancellor explained that not all migrants could stay in Germany and that politics ""can be tough"".
Mrs Merkel tried to comfort the girl by stroking her head.","Twelve people were hurt, including seven teenagers, when fires broke out at two neighbouring refugee hostels in the south German region of Bavaria."

City are now 10 points behind leaders Chelsea after defeat on Merseyside - the heaviest league loss in Guardiola's managerial career.
Asked if the gap was too great, he said: ""Yes. Ten is a lot of points.""
Guardiola, 45, has told his players to unite ""in the bad moments"" and ""forget the table"" until the end of the season.
He added: ""At the end of the season, we are going to evaluate our level and how our performance was, how the coach was, how the players were. After that we are going to decide.""
The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss insisted he was ""so happy in Manchester"" despite his side sitting fifth, two points behind fourth-placed Arsenal.
Guardiola watched City dominate possession on Merseyside but concede four from the six shots they faced.
Only five teams have a lower haul than their four clean sheets in the league - BBC Radio 5 live pundit Robbie Savage said City ""cannot defend"" and questioned if Guardiola would now change his style.
City are the only team in the Premier League to have over 50% of possession in every game this season but they have now conceded from the first shot they have faced in four of their last seven games.
Guardiola added: ""I said to the players be positive because you made some fantastic things during the season and for many reasons we didn't get what I think we deserved.
""In the bad moments we have to be close. It's awful for my players. We created chances but don't score and when they have a chance, they punish us.""
Everton scored with their first two shots through Romelu Lukaku and Kevin Mirallas, with Tom Davies and Ademola Lookman completing the rout.
Lookman's goal came after a John Stones clearance was charged down, throwing the young defender again under the spotlight.
It was Stones' first visit to Goodison Park since leaving Everton for City in a £47.5m deal last summer.
The 22-year-old has been criticised for making too many mistakes, and former Manchester United and Everton defender Phil Neville believes he is being unfairly singled out.
However, fellow pundit Alan Shearer told Match of the Day 2: ""John Stones did have a nightmare. He is 22 now, he has played nearly 100 Premier League games and everyone keeps saying to me and to the rest of the football world, that he is going to be a top player.
""If I'm a centre forward, a young guy and I keep on missing chances, I don't expect to be in the team. Eventually you are going to get left out. I keep seeing Stones making mistakes too often, too many times.""

"But health officials have warned that unless MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations continue, a further outbreak cannot be ruled out.
There have been no laboratory-confirmed cases linked to the outbreak area since 22 May, Public Health Wales said.
One person died and a total of 1,219 measles cases were diagnosed during the outbreak since November.
Some 88 people visited a hospital due to the disease while a campaign was launched to boost the uptake of the MMR vaccine.
Dr Marion Lyons, director of health protection for Public Health Wales (PHW), said that the end of the outbreak was in ""no small part to unprecedented efforts to vaccinate tens of thousands of people"".
""Without so many vaccinations being given, we know that the outbreak could have continued for many more months,"" said Dr Lyons.
But PHW warned that with 30,000 children in the 10 to 18 years age group still unvaccinated across Wales, there was still a possibility of a further outbreak in the future.
And the health minister urged parents to get their children vaccinated.
Dr Lyons said: ""The only reason this outbreak could happen was because not enough young people in Wales were fully vaccinated with two doses of MMR and there is absolutely no guarantee that this could not happen again.""
Some 75,868 unscheduled vaccinations were given to people around Wales who had not been immunised in a bid to bring the epidemic under control.
GP surgeries, hospital and schools held drop-in sessions, with PHW particularly keen to target children and young people who may have missed their scheduled jabs.
Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he ""wholeheartedly"" welcomed the end of the outbreak but insisted there was ""still work to do"".
""The young people in the 10 to 18 age group who still have not been vaccinated should make the necessary arrangements at their earliest convenience,"" he added.
""We would not want to see another outbreak.
""I would like to thank the healthcare professionals for their tireless work in organising and staffing the unscheduled vaccinations drop-in sessions and GPs for the contribution of primary care among others.""
Large numbers of children in the 10-18 age group were not given the MMR vaccine as babies, the result of a scare that caused panic among parents.
It followed research by Dr Andrew Wakefield in the late 1990s which linked the vaccine with autism and bowel disease.
His report, which was published in The Lancet medical journal, was later discredited, with health officials insisting the vaccine was completely safe.
PHW said that even though the outbreak was over, a small number of measles cases were seen in Wales every year - in 2011 there were 19 cases - and parents should still ensure their children were fully vaccinated.
The first dose of MMR should be given at around 12-13 months of age and the second at around three years and four months of age - but it is never too late to catch up on missed doses, say health officials.
PHW advises that anyone born in 1970 or later who has not had measles or two doses of MMR should be vaccinated.
Any babies younger than 12 months who were advised to receive early vaccination as a result of the outbreak will still be called for routine vaccination and should still attend these appointments.
It is not dangerous to receive more than two doses of the vaccine, PHW added.
The measles outbreak centred on the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg health board area - which covers Swansea and Neath Port Talbot - along with the Powys health board area and Hywel Dda, which covers Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Ceredigion.
The Welsh Conservatives renewed their calls for a public inquiry into the epidemic so that lessons could be learned and failings identified.
On Monday, an inquest heard that Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, died from pneumonia after contracting measles during the Swansea outbreak.
He was found dead on his sofa in his flat on 18 April, days after seeing GPs and complaining of a rash all over his body.",The measles epidemic centred on the Swansea area has been declared over eight months after it began.

'Grandiose plan'
The concert was staged by the Moranbong band as its debut performance on Friday, reported state media KCNA.
The band was put together by Kim Jong-un, who has a ''grandiose plan to bring about a dramatic turn in the field of literature and arts this year"", state media said.
North Korean entertainment has traditionally featured nationalist or folk songs, and mass displays.
In recent years, reports say, children in the isolated country have become familiar with characters such as Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh through stationery items and clothes imported from China, North Korea's closest ally.
It seems to point to an easing of North Korea's paranoia about what it calls spiritual pollution from the West, and even more dangerously, South Korea, says the BBC's Charles Scanlon.
It is still illegal to watch South Korean television programmes in North Korea. But a recent report based on interviews with refugees said that North Koreans now have more access to outside media, especially DVDs of popular South Korean drama serials.

Part of the film studio's argument was that it should not need to change the name, citing EU law which states a trademark must be ""a sign"", in the sense of being a single sign and capable of being ""graphically represented"".  The show's name, it said, did not fall into this category.
As a result, the judges have asked the two parties and the UK Intellectual Property Office to enter their submissions on the issue by Monday when they will consider whether to send the case to the European courts.

"Earlier the Saudi foreign ministry said it had turned down the non-permanent seat, accusing the world body of ""double standards"".

It said the Security Council had failed in its duties towards Syria as well as in other world conflicts.
Mr Ban refused to say whether he would be speaking to the Saudi king about the matter.
""I understand that some member states, particularly some concerned group of member states, are discussing [this] among themselves,"" Mr Ban said.
The reaction among diplomats to this unprecedented decision has been one of shock and confusion, the BBC's Nada Tawfik reports from the UN.

""The fact is that the Security Council has been unable to act now for more than two years,"" Mr Araud said, according to AFP.
However, Russia's foreign ministry called the move bewildering, and said Saudi Arabia's criticism of the UN Security Council about its actions over Syria ""is particularly strange"".
By Bridget KendallDiplomatic correspondent, BBC News
Usually there is fierce competition to secure one of the 10 rotating seats on the UN Security Council - a chance to sit alongside the five permanent members for two years  on the top UN body which rules on international security issues.
Instead Saudi Arabia  has used the coveted position to lodge a very public protest.
This is the second protest from Saudi Arabia. Earlier this month the Saudi foreign minister pulled out of giving a speech at the UN General Assembly, expressing similar frustration.
It is a dramatic gesture, but whether it makes immediate reform of the Security Council more likely, as the Saudis demand, is probably questionable.
Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels.
The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council.
The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia.
As well as accusing the council of ""double-standards"" and demanding reform, the Saudi foreign ministry pointed to its failure ""to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years"", which had led to ""numerous wars that have threatened world peace"".
It also criticised the UN's ""failure"" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons.
And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government ""to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions"".
The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons.

"Cummings was in the right place at the right time to convert David Gray's cross for his first.
And the 21-year-old rolled in an opportunistic second from a tight angle when he capitalised on a mix-up in the Buddies' defence.
New signings Andrew Shinnie and Brian Graham both came off the bench to make their debuts for Hibs.
Graham in particular had a brilliant chance to score his first goal for the Leith side but Saints goalkeeper Scott Gallacher blocked the effort.
Former Buddie John McGinn cracked the angle of post and cross-bar late on and any critics of Cummings would say the forward should have gone home with a hat-trick ball.
His double here brought his tally for the season to five already, and the deflected cross from energetic captain Gray only needed a left-foot steer into the net.
Being in the right place to capitalise was key for Cummings, and 10 minutes later his persistence at pestering St Mirren defender Jack Baird and keeper Gallacher was rewarded.
The St Mirren duo left a back-pass to each other and Cummings nipped in to clinically score from a tight angle.
Lennon's managerial effect from the sidelines is clear. Fifteen minutes into this match the former Celtic boss was berating Hibs centre-back Darren McGregor for a lack of urgency.
Players paid attention to Lennon's demands to ""move it quickly"" and ""get it forward"".
Cummings received an earful for a poor second-half pass and Marvin Bartley was rebuked for moaning at the referee. Lennon has got his team by the scruff of the neck.
St Mirren's home form under Alex Rae has been better than his predecessors but there was not much for the locals to get excited about on this occasion - indeed some booed at half-time.
Baird watched his header sail over and substitute David Clarkson shot narrowly wide, but the impression was Hibs had another gear in them if required.
Hibs boss Neil Lennon: ""Jason Cummings is a goalscorer but there's more to his game.
""He got two brilliant goals and could've had a couple more. I thought he got sloppy in the second half and looked a little bit tired.
""If you'd been watching him in the first half you could have had Real Madrid on the phone. But if you'd been watching him second half you would've had Accrington Stanley on the phone - and that's no disrespect to Accrington.""
St Mirren manager Alex Rae: ""The fact is that we dug in and competed in the second half.
""You can't legislate for that second goal. No matter what the preparation is, it's just a miscommunication and it becomes difficult because you're chasing the game.

"Almost none of these will work. Why?
Because, on current polling, it all comes down to whether you think the people voting for Andy Burnham or those voting for Yvette Cooper are more likely to put Corbyn as their next preference.
And there is no decent publicly available evidence that either of them are. Furthermore, for similar reasons, there is no arithmetic reason why non Corbyn candidates withdrawing would do anything to stop Corbyn.
Voters in this election will be given the opportunity to rank the candidates in order of preference. The first preferences are counted up, and the person with the fewest is eliminated from the contest - and the votes they received are given to whoever each person that voted for them rated as their second preference.
If after that none of the candidates has achieved 50% of the vote, the candidate with the lowest number of votes is eliminated and their votes are given to whoever they put as their higher preference amongst the two remaining candidates. By definition, this gives one of the two remaining candidates a majority of the votes.
Current polling puts Corbyn first, Cooper and Burnham roughly tied in second, and Kendall trailing in third. So either Cooper or Burnham will most likely be the candidate that faces Corbyn in the final round. If you want to stop Corbyn, you'll be voting for some combination of Cooper, Burnham and Kendall as your first three preferences. So your vote WILL end up being for whoever faces Corbyn in the final round, WHICHEVER order you put those three in.
The only way you can affect the number of votes Corbyn gets is by trying to second-guess the second preferences of people that vote for eliminated candidates. If you believe the polls, Kendall's almost certain to be eliminated first, so you can't affect that. But one of Burnham and Cooper won't be eliminated before the final run off with Corbyn. Whichever one is eliminated will have their preferences redistributed to either Corbyn or his opponent.
So, in theory, if you, the ""stop Corbyn"" voter thought that, say, Burnham's supporters are more likely to have Corbyn as their next preference than Cooper's, you should put Burnham ahead of Cooper in your preference list even if you ACTUALLY prefer Cooper to Burnham - because it'll starve Corbyn of the extra votes he'd get if Burnham was knocked out.
The thing is, I am not aware of any decent evidence that this is the case. We have very few polls on the Labour leadership election - and those that exist (necessarily) have small samples of what Burnham and Cooper's second preferences would be. Very roughly speaking, the polling tables I've seen suggest supporters of both split their second preferences about 30/70 between Corbyn and his opponent. So it's not clear which of these you should give a higher preference to tactically stop Corbyn anyway.
In other words, there is no obvious way to tactically vote against Corbyn. If you want to stop him he'll be your last preference anyway - and it literally doesn't matter what order your first three preferences are in. Crazy thought though it might be, you can happily vote for candidates on the basis of, y'know, how good you think they are.
This actually has implications for people dropping out of the race as well. Ballot papers have already gone out, but Cooper could, for example, tell all her supporters to first preference Andy Burnham instead. In terms of tactical voting, there is NO POINT in any of the three non Corbyn candidates doing this. All their votes will be aggregated to support whoever faces Corbyn in the final round anyway as a result of the preference system.
Of course, that's just on the arithmetic. There might be a case for candidates dropping out if they think that a unified anti-Corbyn campaign would be more effective at winning over existing Corbyn supporters - perhaps because they spend less time attacking each other. But this is necessarily pretty speculative, especially this late in the game.

"Charlton had thrashed Rovers 5-1 at the Memorial Stadium in November and they were convincing victors again, although they had to do it the hard way after a mistake by Patrick Bauer gifted Rovers a 12th-minute lead.
The Addicks defender slipped while attempting a back pass, enabling Jermaine Easter to burst clear on goal and round Dillon Phillips before slotting into an empty net.
Magennis' free-kick hit the crossbar, while Adam Chicksen's cross was tipped behind by Will Puddy via the woodwork as Charlton sought an equaliser before the break.
Parity was restored four minutes before the interval with Magennis heading home from Joe Aribo's free-kick.
And the duo combined in almost identical circumstances five minutes into the second half, an unmarked Magennis again using his head to convert from Aribo's set-piece delivery.
Aribo turned provider once again just after the hour, playing a low ball across the face of goal which was swept in from close range by Jorge Teixeira to make it 3-1.
Magennis completed his treble after 73 minutes, latching on to Andrew Crofts' pass and then firing an angled shot beyond Puddy in some style.

""I know the trauma and the anguish you must be going through.""
He was interrupted by a member of the public knocking on the window of the public gallery.
The judge asked them to leave the court and for people to ""respect the rule of law"" in a case where ""emotions are flying high"".
During the short hearing, Mr Casey spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth.
He did not enter pleas but the court was told he was likely to do so when the case is next heard.

Although the president-elect will not go to Davos, one of his top advisers - hedge fund boss Anthony Scaramucci - will speak about the new US leader's plans on Tuesday.
Mr Trump, whose ""America first"" pledge helped him win the White House, has also threatened to hike tariffs on goods imported from China.
Mr Xi is taking China's biggest delegation to the elite gathering in Davos, and his appearance is seen as an attempt to present the country as a world leader.
His entourage includes some of China's most successful business people, such as Jack Ma, the founder of e-commerce giant Alibaba, and property magnate Wang Jianlin, who runs the conglomerate Dalian Wanda.
China's vice foreign minister Li Baodong has said Mr Xi will detail the country's views on how to ""steer economic globalisation towards greater inclusiveness"".
Despite the apparent hostility between the US and China, Mr Xi has spoken of a smooth communication channel with Mr Trump's team, and reports suggest the Chinese president would be willing to meet members of the US president-elect's team whilst in Davos.
Mr Xi's attendance has been welcomed by WEF founder Klaus Schwab, who said he expects him to ""show how China will assume in global affairs a responsive and responsible leadership role"".
Responsive and responsible leadership is the theme for this year's gathering, which comes after a year of dramatic events including the UK's Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump.
Mr Schwab has called on attendees to help ""overcome the present mood of divisiveness and negativism"".

"The source close to the inquiry played down the significance of the interviews carried out in Portugal on Tuesday.
Portuguese detectives in Faro were observed during the questioning by officers from the Met Police, which is conducting its own investigation.
Madeleine disappeared aged three in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz in 2007.
The source told the BBC: ""Questioning of the four suspects was concluded yesterday evening. Unfortunately the interviews have led to no new developments and we are back where we were seven years ago.""
The source added: ""The 'arguido' [suspect] status was given to the suspects to protect them. It gives them legal rights including the right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present during interviews.
Jeremy Cooke, BBC News in Praia da Luz
It is clear that the latest developments in the Madeleine McCann case are the result of the detailed, painstaking work being done by British police officers working on Operation Grange.
As their investigation continues, they formally request assistance from the Portuguese police. It is at the request of Scotland Yard officers that four potential new suspects - or arguidos - and 11 potential witnesses are being interviewed.
Those interviews involve detectives from both countries; the Portuguese asking the questions, while the British monitor proceedings.
It is not clear what potential link the British team believe may exist between the ""suspects"" and the disappearance of the three year-old. But clearly there are lines of inquiry they believe are worth following up.
There are, however, clear tensions here. With one source close to the case saying that the investigation is going nowhere and ""we are back where we were seven years ago"".
""They were declared arguido due to being identified as suspects in a letter of international request sent by the British to the Portuguese authorities.""
The Portuguese Attorney General's Office in Lisbon issued a brief statement about the questioning of the four suspects.
It said that requests from the British authorities had been carried out but the content of these requests would remain confidential.
Police have begun the process of interviewing 11 witnesses, which also relates to official requests from the Metropolitan Police.
The source indicated that two tracker dogs from the UK could be used in searching a vehicle thought to belong to one of the witnesses. No time or location was given for this.
One of the four ""persons of interest"" - or arguidos - questioned was Sergey Malinka. He has always denied any involvement.
Mr Malinka, a Russian-born website designer with Portuguese nationality, was questioned as a witness in 2007 when Madeleine went missing.
On Tuesday, Mr Malinka and another suspect left the central police station in Faro after they were interviewed.
A third person, who is said to be suffering from severe schizophrenia, remained inside the police headquarters after the other two had left.
All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens. They have all been summoned to be interviewed; there have been no arrests.
The status of arguidos in the Portuguese judicial system refers to individuals whom police may reasonably suspect are linked to a crime.
In June, Portuguese and British officers searched three sites in Praia da Luz but found no evidence relating to the case.
Scotland Yard said at the time that ""more activity"" had been agreed with Portuguese police and the searches were the ""first phase"" of a major investigation.
The McCann family - from Rothley, Leicestershire - were staying in an apartment in Praia da Luz when Madeleine was last seen.
Her parents had been at a restaurant near their apartment when she went missing.","Questioning of four suspects in the Madeleine McCann investigation has concluded without any new developments, a source has told the BBC."
"The former Sierra Leone tactician was dismissed on Thursday after 15 months in-charge of Amavubi.
McKinstry said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" and the reasons ""had not been made fully clear"" to him.
McKinstry took over the Rwanda job from Englishman Stephen Constantine who stepped down in March 2015.
The Northern Irishman then led Rwanda to the quarter final stage of the 2016 Africa Nations Championship that they hosted.
He also led the team to the runner-up spot in the 2015 Cecafa Senior Challenge Cup in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
""The specific reasons behind the decision have not been made fully clear to me given our performance to date, I am therefore both surprised and disappointed by the announcement today, and that myself and the team will not be able to finish what we started,"" he said.
The 30-year old coach managed to record 11 wins, two draws and a dozen defeats in the 25 games he was in charge of Rwanda.
According to the Rwanda FA, McKinstry was sacked because he did not achieve some of the targets that had been set for him.

Pearson, back in management following his sacking by Leicester in June 2015, won the Championship title with the Foxes in 2013-14.
Derby County boss Nigel Pearson:
""I was very pleased with our determination and the fact that the players kept on trying to function as a team. Although we weren't playing at our best and didn't use the ball as well as I would have liked to have done, we worked really hard to protect our own goal.
""We had some very good chances early on, we started the first half very well and they started the second half very well.
""What's important for me with this performance and this result is that if people have the opinion that in the past we may have lost, I was interested and very pleased to see our players work so hard to not allow a tight game to go to the opponents.
""You've got to try and win games but if you can't win them you don't lose them and I think both managers would be saying very similar things.""
Brighton & Hove Albion manager Chris Hughton:
""I think in the last few years a draw here is going to be a very good result. I thought although we needed David Stockdale to make a couple of very good saves, we edged the chances.
""I thought we had the better of the chances but I thought on the balance of play a draw was probably a fair result. I think what you have with Glenn [Murray] is a player who will be a wonderful signing for us but he's come in on the back of a season last year when he didn't have too many starts.
""But he's a worker for the team so my delight with him is how he's got into those positions and if he does that enough times over a season he will score goals.
""Generally you don't know what you are going to get first game of the season but I thought the application of the team was excellent and apart from winning and goals I think I've got everything I wanted today.""

"A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth.
The proposal to allow abortion in such cases was defeated by 59 votes to 40.
The result followed a passionate debate at Stormont after some MLAs proposed the law change be introduced by way of an amendment to the Justice Bill.
Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.
Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.
Politicians have been lobbied to reform the law since 2013, when Northern Ireland woman Sarah Ewart spoke out about having to travel to Great Britain for an abortion after she was told she was carrying a baby that had no chance of survival.
The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) faced criticism from other parties during Wednesday's debate for asking the Health Minister Simon Hamilton to set up a working group to examine the issues raised by fatal foetal abnormality.
It could take six months for the group to complete its work and the Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt claimed it was a DUP ""device"" to delay decision making on abortion reform until after May's assembly election.
Justice Minister David Ford, who brought forward the proposed change to the legislation, told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show it could now remain in limbo for some time.
""It would appear that that is what some people want, that it was any excuse at all to avoid taking a decision last night so they can fudge the issue,"" he said.
""We will wait and see what happens to the DUP's supposed working group for the next six months. Certainly, we'll get the DUP past the election, maybe that's why they're doing it.""
However, the DUP has argued that the issue required proper consideration by MLAs and ministers and that the Justice Bill was not intended for this purpose.
The amendment to legalise abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality was proposed by Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson.
He told MLAs: ""If we are to continue to fail women in Northern Ireland in this area then we are abdicating our duties as representatives.
""The traumatic journey to England for many young women is becoming a shame on Northern Ireland and to force women with a fatal foetal pregnancy to look elsewhere for help and support make this worse.""
The amendment relating to pregnancies which are the result of rape or incest was put forward by Anna Lo, also of the Alliance Party, and was defeated by by 64 votes to 30.
Mr Nesbitt said that as a man he did not feel comfortable ""discussing what a woman should do with her body"" but he added that MLAs had a responsibility to legislate.
He claimed the DUP's request for a commission was a delaying tactic designed to ""kick the decision to the far side of the election"".
Mr Nesbitt described the delay as ""cruel"" and ""Dickensian"".
""This is Bleak House we're in today, in the Chancery courts waiting day after day, after day, after day for a decision that never comes,"" he said.
Sinn Féin MLA Caitríona Ruane also criticised the DUP for ""supporting a commission which will report in six months"".
""What about the plight of women in the here and now? What about the women who are pregnant as the result of rape, or women who are faced with fatal foetal abnormalities?
""Is the DUP going to tell them 'we're having a commission in six months and sure, then we'll see where is goes?'  I'm sorry, long-fingering this does a disservice to women,"" Ms Ruane said.
However, Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MLAs expressed doubt that doctors could accurately predict that an unborn child had no chance of survival.
SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly said clinicians had told her party that ""there is no such definition"" as fatal foetal abnormality.
Speaking independently from her party, Alliance MLA Anna Lo proposed that women who have become pregnant as a result of sexual crime should have access to a legal abortion in Northern Ireland.
Ms Lo said that forcing pregnant rape victims to give birth meant they would be ""reminded every day of that act of violence which was forced upon her"".
However, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister described Ms Lo's amendment as a  ""charter for abortion on demand"".
He said that because of his background as a barrister he had more experience than most MLAs of rape trials and added that ""95% of the time, the question for the jury is - was the sexual intercourse consensual or not?""
""All you have to do is to allege indecent assault it seems, rape, and you're entitled on the nod of a medical practitioner to abortion,"" he said.
Mr Allister told MLAs that allegations of rape could only be proven through ""due process"" and this was not possible within the timeframe of pregnancy.
DUP MLA Emma Pengelly spoke in support of the working group on fatal foetal abnormality.
""I have not had the beautiful privilege to have brought a child into this world but I can empathise with all my heart that the wished for, the longed for, can turn so quickly to tragedy,"" she said.
""The way forward that we are proposing is a compassionate one, it is a sensible one, it is a common sense one that will leave all of us in a much better and informed position to chart a loving and kind way forward.""
At the end of the debate, Assembly Speaker Mitchel McLaughlin commended MLAs on the ""sense of dignity"" they displayed during the discussions.
Stormont's chief legal adviser, Attorney General John Larkin QC, is among those who are opposed to changing the law and has outlined concerns that the move could breach obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD).
Precious Life, one of the largest pro life organisations in the region vowed to ""expose"" any MLA who voted in favour of the new legislation.
Amnesty International said failing to reform the law would be a ""betrayal of women"", while the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission urged political action.",Northern Ireland Assembly members have voted against legalising abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality.
"The spacecraft, which takes visible and infrared pictures of the Earth, was launched in June and is now undergoing a period of commissioning.
The observer is the second dedicated mission to fly in the European Union's Copernicus programme.
This will see a multi-billion-euro series of satellite sensors put in orbit over the next few years.
Sentinel-2a, however, will be the system's backbone, producing a wide range of imaging products that will focus predominantly on the planet's land surface.
The European Space Agency, which led the development of the platform, released a taster on Monday of what to expect.
These views ranged from cities and forests to glaciers and coral reefs.
""They are stunning,"" said mission manager Bianca Hoersch.
""Okay, we still have some calibration work to do, on co-registration between visible and shortwave infrared bands, but I think you can see just from this release that the quality is going to be really excellent.""
Sentinel-2a is the European equivalent of America's Landsat mission, which has been imaging the surface of the Earth for 40 years.
The US satellite's data is free and open, which has driven a multitude of applications. Most people will probably know it best from the map tools they use on their computers and smartphones. These all incorporate Landsat pictures.
Sentinel's data has been designed to be complementary, but the platform also represents a big jump in capability.
Its imaging instrument will be sensitive across more bands of light (13 versus Landsat's eight), allowing it to discern more information about the land beneath it; and Sentinel-2a will ""carpet map"" a much wider strip of ground (290km versus 185km).
In addition, its colour images have a best resolution of 10m, versus Landsat's 30m.
Given that today, non-specialist use of Earth imagery overwhelmingly relies on Landsat data, it is more than probable that Sentinel products will be in big demand.
The European Commission will be using Sentinel pictures in its Copernicus programme to run variety of services, reaching across agriculture and forestry, urban planning and disaster mitigation.
Agriculture, though, is certain to be a big user. The satellite's camera sensor has been designed to detect very specific wavelengths of light that detail the health of plants.
In normal operation, Sentinel-2a will be producing 1.7 terabytes of processed data per day. And this will double when the sister satellite, Sentinel-2b, is launched next year.
""The data volume is incredible,"" Dr Hoersch told BBC News.
""Of course, we all knew it would be like this, but when you sit there with your computer and try to download it, it's massive - gigabytes of data.  I had to go out at the weekend and buy a hard disk to store all these products for my presentations.""
Esa will launch Sentinel-3a at the end of 2015. This satellite is dedicated to observing the oceans.

"The reforms are thought to include tax rises and pension changes.
Greece is due to present the proposals by 22:00 GMT on Thursday to try to secure a third bailout and prevent a possible exit from the eurozone.
The new proposals will be studied by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and a full EU summit on Sunday.
Defence Minister and junior coalition party leader Panos Kammenos gave no further details of the agreed plans as he left the prime minister's official residence, where ministers had been meeting.
Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has spent the day discussing the proposals with his cabinet.
Greek media are reporting that the reforms will be put to the Greek parliament on Friday for approval.
On Wednesday Greece formally submitted a request for an unspecified loan from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund.
This would be a fresh loan ""to meet Greece's debt obligations and to ensure stability of the financial system"", Greece says - in other words, to avoid bankruptcy.
The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who will chair Sunday's EU summit, said he hoped to receive ""concrete and realistic proposals of reforms from Athens"".
Such proposals ""will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,"" Mr Tusk added.
However the German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that ""a classic haircut"" (meaning reducing the value of Greece's debts) was ""out of the question"" for her.
All Greek to you? Debt jargon explained
Speaking in Sarajevo, Mrs Merkel said the eurozone had dealt with the issue of debt sustainability in 2012.
She described Sunday's EU summit as a decisive and important meeting.
""We must not forget that the Greek people are suffering at the moment,"" she said.
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also ruled out debt relief for Greece, saying ""there cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union"".
Greece needs to implement reforms to win the trust of its eurozone partners, Mr Schaeuble said. He told a conference in Frankfurt that his message to the new Greek Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos was: ""Just do it!"".

The Greek government has meanwhile extended bank closures and the €60 (£43; $66) daily limit on cash machine withdrawals until Monday.
The curbs were imposed on 28 June, after a deadlock in bailout talks with creditors led to a rush of withdrawals.
Louka Katseli, the head of the Greek bank association, said on Thursday that there was enough liquidity in cash machines to serve the public until Monday.

On Thursday, EU Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he was hopeful of a new deal: ""I have the sense that the dialogue is established, or restored, and that there is a way out.""
The IMF, lowering its economic growth forecast for the world for 2015, said events in Greece would have a ""limited"" effect on the rest of the global economy, as Greece makes up just 2% of the eurozone.
What happens next?
European Stability Mechanism explained
Greece's creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - have already provided more than €200bn in two bailouts since a rescue plan began five years ago.
The second bailout expired on 30 June.
The creditors had hoped for new, concrete proposals from Greece at a meeting on Tuesday but these were not submitted and they instead agreed to set a new deadline of Thursday.
Greece has been warned this is the ""final deadline"".
Mr Tusk has said this is ""now maybe the most critical moment in the history of the eurozone"".
""This is really and truly the final wake-up call for Greece and for us, our last chance,"" he said, adding that failure ""may lead to the bankruptcy of Greece"".
Mr Tsipras's Syriza party was elected in January pledging to oppose the harsh austerity measures demanded by creditors.
And on Sunday, the Greek people decisively rejected the latest bailout proposals from creditors in a referendum.
Energy minister and influential Syriza member Panayiotis Lafazanis insisted on Thursday that Greece would not sign up to a third bailout if it brought ""harsh austerity, suffering and deprivation to the Greek people"".
He insisted Greece had ""alternative options to a new bailout deal"" and there was ""no gun pointed at its head"".
Supporters of Greece staying in the euro held a rally in central Athens on Thursday night.","Greece's government has agreed a reform programme and will submit its proposals to its international lenders soon, the defence minister has said."

Chris Horn, from Newbury in Berkshire, came up with the idea whilst on his tractor and hopes the idea could spread across the UK.
He says the business model could help other young farmers but adds that 40% of their revenue goes on licensing fees.",A fourth generation farmer has found a novel way to diversify his business by showing movies in his fields.
"The film told the story of a fictional plot to assassinate Kim Jong-un. Hackers broke into film company Sony's computers, and weeks later threatened to target any cinema which screened the film.
An FBI investigation concluded that North Korea was to blame for the cyber attack. North Korea responded angrily, with Kim Jong-un calling President Obama a ""monkey"".
What do we know about his ambitions? Four insiders offer their insight into what Kim Jong-un wants.
Jean Lee was born in America to South Korean parents and grew up hearing stories about Korean families separated by the war in 1953. A few years ago, she became the first foreign journalist to open a bureau inside North Korea.
She was in the crowd when Kim Jong-un was first introduced to the Korean people at a military parade, and says he has had to work hard to establish his own power base.
""When he came out there was just a complete sense of shock and awe among the people at the plaza. They had never seen a picture of him. They had only really known of his existence, officially, a few weeks earlier.
""It was quite a shock to see somebody so young who was being groomed to be the next leader. He was not the oldest son, so wasn't the obvious shoo-in. There's clearly something about him, ambition, perhaps a kind of ruthlessness, some qualities that his father saw in him that he thought would carry this country into the next generation.""
The world saw that ruthlessness a year ago, when he ordered the execution of his uncle for allegedly trying to overthrow the state. And the regime is known to use violence to quash dissent among ordinary people too.
But Jean Lee says it would be a mistake to think Kim Jong-un maintains control only through fear:
""One of the things that I've seen on the ground over the past couple of years is all the construction of these skating rinks. There's actually a skateboard park, the ski resort of course that opened last year, massive projects. I see all of this as an investment that they're making in their future.  He is a young man.  If he is going to win the support of the future generations of North Koreans who are going to be his power base, he's got to find a way to win their loyalty and this is part of that.""
Geoffrey See is a Singaporean who has been travelling back and forth to North Korea for the past seven years, working with young entrepreneurs. He says North Koreans are now thinking more innovatively about the economy:
""About six years ago when we first started our programme, our counterparts would often start off with a very long spiel about socialism and how this is the system they have and they are never going to change it.
""In recent years instead of saying that, people talk about... trying to bring in what's best from overseas, and try to adjust it to fit into the system.  So I think that's a very interesting change in terms of thinking.""
Where this new investment is being targeted is also interesting.
""If you look at the economic zones that North Korea was investing in, one of the key areas is Wonsan. So this is an economic zone on the east coast of North Korea.  It faces Japan and it borders South Korea.  So it is kind of almost the furthest location you can have from China. So we believe that it's part of this broader aim to balance off Chinese economic influence in North Korea.""
Kim Jong-un has also been making overtures to Russian President Putin. Two years ago, Russia wrote off 90% of North Korea's debt. But Geoffrey See says there aren't many foreign investors willing to engage with the country's idiosyncratic business environment:
""We would email the North Koreans two, three, four times and we [wouldn't] get a response, and we used to get very worried about it.  We wondered if they are reading our messages, if things are moving ahead.
""We would go in like three months later from the first set of emails.  When we meet with them we ask them, 'Did you receive our emails?' The response is always like, 'Oh, you are coming in three months' time, we didn't feel the need to send a response because we can just chat when you're back in here'.""
Kim Myong Chol was born and lives in Japan, but is ethnically Korean.
He has been to North Korea more than 20 times in the last 40 years, and says he has met representatives of the country's elite as well as, in his words, the two Kims - Kim Jong-un's father and grandfather. He hasn't met the third Kim yet, but praises his ""guts, determination and intelligence"".
The Inquiry: What does Kim Jung-un Want? was broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesday 27 January 2015.

Some describe Kim Myong Chol as an unofficial spokesman for the leader.
""What makes him different from the two Kims,"" he argues, ""is that he will succeed in getting what he wants. The reunification of Korea, without foreign interference.  Eventually the US will leave Korea and the Korean peninsula will be re-unified.
""[The US will] realise the futility, the senselessness of American military presence in Korea. North Korea [will] become too strong for America. We have now nuclear weapons, we have intercontinental ballistic missiles, we have hydrogen bomb.
""We are victims of American aggression. North Korea is a most sanctioned country. Brutalised, criminalised, isolated by America.""
He insists Kim Jong-un's unpredictable behaviour is part of his strategy to fight back:
""North Korea is a very small country. The USA is a big country with nuclear weapons.  How to defeat the enemy? Outsmart them. That's the only way North Korea can survive, outsmart America.""
Yanmei Xie is senior China analyst for the International Crisis Group in Beijing.
She argues that Kim Jong-un can do little without China's support.
""North Korea relies on China for survival. If China cut the fuel supply across the Yarlu River which is between North Korea and China, then the regime... will collapse in a matter of weeks. So Beijing plays a very crucial and vital role in the Korean Peninsula.""
And when North Korea does something that China doesn't like, its punishment is swift and exact:
""When there were reports and intelligence saying North Korea could be on the brink of a fourth nuclear test, China slowed down fuel supply and food aid.
""But before it did that, China looked into the fuel supply and harvest of grain and calculated the amount of reduction in order to make sure that the reduction would not cause instability. [This] was meant to send a signal of displeasure but not to destabilise the regime or cause real pain.""
This is because China also needs its neighbour: North Korea stands between China and the 28,000 US soldiers stationed in South Korea.
""North Korea used to be a military buffer for China in terms of heading off any potential advance of US armies. Now in the age of naval and air dominance of United States, a land war is not as important, but North Korea remains a political buffer in that it is a buffer between China and South Korea, which remains a US ally.
""So China shares interest of managing Kim Jong-un. But I think sometimes people confuse that with signs that China is ready to abandon the Kim Jong-un regime. But actually it's the opposite. China is... stabilising the regime... to prolong, to preserve the current status quo.""

"He died on Monday, aged 89, in a nursing home in Newmarket-on-Fergus in County Clare, following an illness.
Bishop Casey resigned as Bishop of Galway following the revelation he had been making payments to a woman in the United States for a long period.
He had a relationship with an American divorcee and was the father of her son.
Peter Murphy was born in 1974 and was the result of Bishop Casey's affair with Annie Murphy.
Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra programme, Michael Kelly of The Irish Catholic newspaper described the event as ""the beginning of the end of the extreme dominance of the Catholic Church in Irish public life"".
When the relationship became public in 1992, Bishop Casey resigned his post and went to America.
He later moved to Mexico to learn Spanish, worked as a missionary priest in Ecuador and then worked in a parish in England before retiring to Galway 14 years later.
In 2006 he came home to live in Shanaglish, near Gort, County Galway, and then Carrigoran Nursing Home in County Clare in 2011.
Born in County Kerry on 24 April 1927, Bishop Casey was educated in Limerick and in Saint Patrick's College, Maynooth, from where he was ordained to the priesthood in 1951.
For the next nine years he worked as a curate in two Limerick city parishes before being appointed to the Irish Emigrant Chaplaincy Service in England.
He became well-known while working in London for sourcing adequate housing for thousands of Irish emigrants.
On Monday, the Catholic Church said ""his passionate advocacy for social justice and for those marginalised by inequality gave him a significant public profile and his work in this area continued throughout his life"".
He was appointed Bishop of Kerry in 1969 before taking on the larger and more high-profile diocese of Galway and Kilmacduagh in 1976.
""Perhaps the highlight of his time in Galway was his organising and hosting the visit of Pope John Paul II to the city in 1979 to meet and pray with 300,000 young people from all over Ireland,"" the Catholic Church said.
Bishop Casey was present at the funeral of his murdered friend Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador when the liturgy was interrupted by bombs and intense gunfire which left almost 50 mourners dead.
He also voiced strong objections to the visit of US President Ronald Regan to Galway in 1984 because of ""American foreign policy"".
Archbishop Eamon Martin said:  ""It is with great sadness that I learned today of the death of Bishop Eamonn Casey.
""I wish to sincerely acknowledge the contribution of Bishop Casey to the work of the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference over twenty-three years during his time as Bishop of Kerry and as Bishop of Galway"".","Former Bishop of Galway, Eamon Casey, who was at the centre of a scandal that rocked the Catholic Church in the early 1990s, has died."
"Shipping containers are a common feature of the Kenyan landscape.
You'll find these steel boxes converted into comfortable homes, clinics and offices.
Others are turned into shops and granaries to store farm products.
But now shipping containers have entered the sphere of learning.
Starting this year, national examinations materials will be stored in secure shipping containers and placed under 24-hour armed police surveillance.
This is just one of the many new tough measures that the government is introducing to curb cheating in national exams.
In a country where people often rely on well-connected relatives and friends to succeed, education is everything.
Such is the thirst for personal development that around 20:00 on weekday evenings, you'll find the streets of Nairobi and other urban centres teeming with people of all ages going home from class.
Evening classes are a popular way for Kenyans to acquire a second or third degree with the hope of rising higher in life.
Competition for promotion or for the few job opportunities that become available is intense, leading to a desperate desire for more and better academic qualifications.
Joseph Warungu:
""There is a crisis of trust in Kenyan society.""
This pressure to succeed starts at primary school.
As a result, cartels have emerged to take advantage.
Working with some of the former national examinations council officials, police officers and teachers, these cartels have found a way to get hold of exam papers and sell them to desperate students and parents.
But last year things got out of hand as the cheating reached industrial proportions.
More than 5,000 primary and secondary school students had their exam results cancelled; the national examinations board was disbanded and some senior managers fired.
Nearly 200 people including police officers were arrested and charged over exam malpractices.
There is a crisis of trust in Kenyan society.
The government cannot trust the teacher to prepare the students for exams without cheating.
The teacher cannot trust the government to oversee the exams without cheating.
The student cannot trust himself to pass the exam without cheating.
And so in comes the tough steel containers to try and safeguard trust.
This year the government is not taking any chances.
By the time national exams begin in November, invigilators will have been vetted afresh.
Head teachers will now be held personally liable for any incidents of cheating that occur in their schools because they will have the sole responsibility of collecting from, and returning, the exam materials to the containers at central distribution points.
The government is so confident of the measures it has taken that the cabinet secretary for education gave this warning:
""I want to tell all children in candidate classes, that they better prepare for the exams. The monkey business that has been going on shall never happen again"".
But education is not the only sector suffering from the trust deficit.
Governance is badly hit.
Recently, a group of more than 30 elected County Assembly members, who were planning to impeach their Nyeri county governor in central Kenya, decided to spend the night inside the County Assembly under police guard, fearing that their opponents would kidnap them to frustrate the motion.
And in the last few days news has emerged of an invention to help curb drink driving.
The device, developed by a young university student, has an inbuilt breathalyser that detects the driver's alcohol level.
If it's too high, the device transmits a signal and prevents the engine from starting.
So why the need for such a device?
Road accidents kill an average of 3,000 people a year in Kenya and many of the accidents are caused by speeding and drink driving.
The government doesn't trust drivers not to get behind the wheel while drunk, and so it introduced alcohol breathalysers operated by traffic police.
But the public does not trust the police, because they can be easily bribed.
And the drunk driver does not trust anyone else to drive him home safely, except himself.
And so enter the Alcohol and Sound Detection System being developed by a young Kenyan.
It would be far cheaper and more effective to transform the Kenyan mind from within.
Instead the focus is on the symptoms of the epidemic:
If they cheat in exams, lock up exam materials in steel containers.
If democracy is in danger, hide it in locked chambers.
If the driver is too drunk to drive, let the car talk to him.
I think I'll now just retire to my shipping container house and trust that society will sort itself out.

We have spoken to a number of local historians and cinema enthusiasts and the general consensus is that it closed due to dwindling audiences.
Historian Ron Miles said there were once 26 cinemas in the Telford area and two in Oakengates - but they became less popular when people started to get televisions in their own homes.
Another local historian, Rob Breeze, remembers being taken to The Grosvenor to watch Carry on Cleo.
He agreed that a lot of cinemas started closing from the late-1960s onwards, as demand fell.
There is also a theory that the cinema had to close to make way for the flyover carrying the A442 Queensway.
But according to the book ""Silver Screen Memories"" that is not true, because the road was not built until 1975.
Like many parts of the UK, terraced houses - with one design repeated along a row of joined homes - were built in the city in great numbers following the industrial revolution.
Local historian Fred Hughes said many were built around the six town centres of Burslem, Fenton, Hanley, Longton, Stoke and Tunstall.  These went on to form Stoke-on-Trent.
They were built close to industrial centres for pottery and mining due to the lack of transport links, he said, with many knocked down towards the end of the 1950s and early 60s when they were replaced by housing estates like Chell Heath and Bentilee.
Stoke's terraced houses hit the headlines in 2013 when the city council sold off 35 of the properties, mainly in the Cobridge area, for £1.

She pays £825 a month to rent a room in a shared house in Lambeth, south London, where she has her own bathroom and kitchen.
She said: ""I would like to get on the housing ladder but I have resigned myself to the fact that working in social care isn't going to get you the right salary, let alone give you the chance to save up for anything.
""I would love to own a home so that no one can kick me out, as I now have to leave my house as the landlady wants to sell.
""I've lived in Manchester, Edinburgh and my home town in Yorkshire but I've never been happier and more comfortable than in London. This is really important to me and I have created a great network of friends so the idea of moving and starting again somewhere else, as I've done twice before, is too exhausting to think about.
""I hope it doesn't come to having to leave but I suppose I can't rule it out completely if it gets that desperate.""
Freelance musician and composer Matt Winkworth has been renting houses around Oxford for 10 years, but to gain security he has decided to buy a narrow boat, which he intends to live in.
The 31-year-old said: ""Buying a boat is something that I've been thinking about doing for a long time.
""I've thought about getting a mortgage, but I would have to move out of the area that I work [in], it's impossible to buy anywhere in the South East.
""[Living in the boat] will be the first time I have lived on my own.""
Sophie Mogridge moved to Oxford last year and lives in a three-bedroom house with two friends.
The trainee teacher has resigned herself to the fact that she can no longer live in the city, which is considered the most unaffordable place to live in Britain.
She spends £515 a month on rent but, when bills are taken into account, she spends half her £18,000-a-year income on accommodation.
The 23-year-old said: ""My rent is incredibly high but my salary isn't as high.
""That means I'm not able to do all the social things that all my friends [outside of Oxford] can do.
""I'm actually moving to Banbury so I can afford to enjoy life.""

Copeland in Cumbria seems to have that magic mix of cheap rents and high wages.
However, the data does not tell the full story.  Copeland is home to the Sellafield nuclear fuel reprocessing and nuclear decommissioning site. There are also proposals for a new nuclear power station, the Moorside project, to the north of the current Sellafield site. The energy industry in Copeland also includes the Walney Wind Farm offshore.
Lynne Atkinson, of Cumbrian lettings agency Grisdales, said: ""Nuclear power does skew the figures when it comes to wages as there are some very well-paid jobs in the area.
""It is good value for money renting in Copeland and the market is very strong. It is cheaper than other areas in the North West, such as the Lakes. There has also been a lot of buy to let investment.""
Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""Our chronic housing shortage means private renting is no longer a stepping stone for people starting out in life - it's where a quarter of families have to live.
""And with sky high rents eating up a huge chunk of people's monthly income, it's sadly no surprise that at Shelter we're hearing from growing numbers of families who are struggling just to cover the cost of the basics, and keep a roof over their heads.""

Henry Gregg, assistant director of communications and campaigns at the National Housing Federation said: ""These figures provide yet more evidence of how seriously unaffordable renting is in this country. Sky-high rents mean unstable and uncertain living situations are becoming the norm.""
Our investigation used the median average, which describes the middle value in a set.
The median monthly take home pay in England is about £1,833, after tax and national insurance contributions.
That means rent should take up no more than £550.  The England average price of a room in a house is £382, while a one-bedroom property costs £694.
Alan Ward, who chairs the Residential Landlords Association said there was a rental ""supply crisis"" because the government had focussed on home ownership.
According to a survey carried out by the association, 84% of landlords were considering raising rent due to ""punitive tax changes by the government"".
A Department of Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""More than 300,000 people have been helped in homeownership through government-backed schemes since 2010, while almost 900,000 more homes have been delivered since the end of 2009.
""But we know there is more to do. That's why we've doubled the housing budget, including investing £8bn in an extra 400,000 quality affordable homes to rent and buy.
""We're also extending shared ownership, giving more people the chance to buy a home with a deposit of as little as £1,500.""

"Holyrood's public audit committee has written to the justice secretary saying SPA chairman Andrew Flanagan appeared to have ""behaved inappropriately"".
The letter follows a series of heated evidence sessions at parliament, which saw one MSP tell police bosses ""it's not the Kremlin you're running"".
Mr Flanagan insisted the group has made ""substantial progress"" over 12 months.
MSPs have been conducting an inquiry alongside a separate probe by HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary in Scotland Derek Penman into the governance of the SPA and concerns about transparency.
The letter from the committee, which was addressed to Justice Secretary Michael Matheson and copied to Mr Flanagan, is highly critical of the chairman and the running of the board.
It reads: ""We are writing to set out our very serious concerns about the standards of governance at the SPA, following our recent evidence sessions.
""In particular, we consider that the chairman of the SPA board, Mr Andrew Flanagan, would appear to have behaved inappropriately on occasion and in a manner not in keeping with relevant Scottish government guidance.
""We consider this to be unacceptable, particularly in relation to a public body that performs such a vital role.""
The committee were particularly critical about a row over meetings being held behind closed doors, which saw one board member, Moi Ali, quit. She told members that she felt she had been bullied, describing her exit from the board as ""a really horrendous experience"".
The letter notes: ""It appears to us that Mr Flanagan treated Ms Ali in an inappropriate manner, to the degree that she felt obliged to resign from the board.""
While members acknowledged there would be times when public bodies would have to discuss matters in private, they said the ""default position for such an important body is that its committees should meet in public"".
And they said it would be ""entirely unacceptable"" for the SPA to repeat the situation where private meetings were held to discuss governance with no notes being taken, saying there was ""a clear need for a culture shift within the organisation so that there are far fewer private meetings"".
On the matter of transparency, they said some of the board's ""decisions on basic operational matters have been inexplicable"", and said SPA board members ""should be far more critical in how they question or challenge some of the decisions made by the chair of the board"".
In response to the letter, a spokesman for the SPA said: ""As board members outlined this week, the SPA is listening to public and civic concerns and has already signalled it is ready to adapt its approach at the next public board meeting.
""In addition, HMICS is currently looking at governance within the SPA and we are working closely with the inspectorate to facilitate that review. Its findings and recommendations will further inform our approach to improved governance and transparency.""
During his appearance at Holyrood in April, Mr Flanagan insisted the group had made ""substantial"" progress over the past year, adding: ""I believe I am doing an effective job.""
He said: ""I think we've made a number of substantial movements within the last 12 months based on the governance review.
""I think we are becoming more effective, I think it is important that we recognise that there is already a high and significant degree of openness through the public board meetings that we have which are second to none in terms of public bodies in Scotland.
""I think we are on a journey. Is it perfect? No, it's not perfect, but I think in the last 12 months or so there have been significant steps forward.""
And in a subsequent sitting on Thursday, current board member George Graham said there had been a ""changing atmosphere"" since Mr Flanagan took over, saying the board was ""much more engaged"" with ""a clearer sense of purpose"".","MSPs have voiced ""very serious concerns"" about how the Scottish Police Authority is run."

"The researchers say that soda is more effective than current methods and less damaging to the environment.
The team have already successfully trialled microcapsules filled with the substance.
They believe that the baking soda approach could be 40% cheaper than existing technology.
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is believed by many scientists and politicians to be a critical element in global attempts to avoid dangerous levels of climate change caused by CO2 emissions.
The burning of coal, gas and oil for energy production remains the single biggest source of the gas.
For years researchers have been working to build experimental technology that would capture CO2 from chimneys and flue pipes before it gets into the atmosphere. The gas would then be buried permanently, deep underground.
Indeed the promises made in Paris Climate Agreement to limit global temperatures to ""well below"" 2 degrees will need significant deployment of CCS.
""Nobody can see us keeping temperatures increases below 1.5 degrees without these technologies,"" said Dr Oliver Geden at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
""Yet there hasn't been any debate about this technology and it doesn't exist at scale.""
The equipment and chemicals that need to be built on to a power station to extract the CO2 are known to be expensive and cumbersome.
While governments and industry both recognise the benefits of such a system, they have been unwilling to put up the large amounts of cash needed.
Late last year the UK government pulled the plug on a Â£1bn competition to build a scaled-up version of the technology.
Scientists are now looking at other materials to see if they can achieve the same impact but at a lower cost.
At the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California, they believe that baking soda could be a key ingredient for curbing the carbon.
They've created microcapsules that have a liquid solution of sodium carbonate (also known as soda ash) at their core, surrounded by a polymer shell that allows CO2 to flow through.
The tiny blue balls sit in an aqueous solution which prevents them from sticking together. When they come in contact with CO2 they change colour to a yellowish brown. Exposure of sodium carbonate to CO2 and water creates sodium bicarbonate - otherwise known as baking soda.
""The whole idea is that by making these individual capsules you can have a dramatically increased surface area, so if they clump together you can decrease that,"" said researcher Congwang Ye.
""You really want to have them separated.""
The scientists say that current CCS techniques using chemicals like monoethanolamine are toxic and expensive and create as many problems as they solve.
The LLNL team believe that baking soda can do an effective job at a much lower price.
""Like all the commercial CO2 schemes we have today, the goal for large scale implementation is taking many tonnes of gas from a power plant and finding geological features deep underground where we can inject that CO2 and it will stay indefinitely,"" said Joshua Stolaroff, an environmental researcher at Livermore.
""Microcapsule solvents like we've developed can do that, we hope, at lower energy use and capital cost, about 40% lower than the current methods.""
One advantage of the microcapsule approach is that recovery of the captured carbon is done by heating the baking soda solution, and that means the scientists get a more pure form of the gas - which increases its value for other industries.
But with production of the capsules limited to about a kilogram a day, the research team understand that this is a long term project.
""We think in the US, our regulations will promote carbon capture and storage at a commercial scale around 2022, and we look at technologies that can be ready around that time,"" said Joshua Stolaroff.
""We hope that around that time frame the benefits of our technologies will be developed and known.""
Thanks to 3D printing and advanced computational techniques, the researchers in California are not limited to capsules.
They are developing a range of materials that can be built and tested quickly thanks to the technology.
""You can think of it as CO2 capture fabric,"" said engineer Du Nguyen as he showed me a little pink piece of material.
""What this is made of is a silicone material and inside of that are lots of little bits of sodium carbonate. You can almost think of it as a CO2 sponge.""
The idea is that the researchers can customise carbon capture materials to fit chimneys or flue pipes. The absorbent sponge could be printed to fill a structure completely which would more effectively soak up carbon, thus reducing costs.
The researchers test the effectiveness of the baking soda materials by soaking them in sparkling water. The baking soda absorbs the carbon bubbles, rapidly turning the water flat.
The scientists believe that the baking soda capsules and sponges could be used in a host of applications, not just at power plants.
They argue that since the materials are easy to transport and recover the carbon gas from, they could kick start the growth of niche carbon recovery operations in places like breweries.
Several years of testing and refining the products lie ahead - but the researchers believe that what they are learning could have a significant long term impact on carbon emissions.
""Sometimes the solutions have been sitting right in front of you for a very long time,"" said Joshua Stolaroff with a laugh.
""And we think there is great promise that baking soda might save the world!""

"Goodluck Jonathan said it had been not just an attack on Nigeria, but an attack on the international community.
The radical Islamist group, Boko Haram, told the BBC it was behind the blast in the capital, which left at least 23 people dead and 81 wounded.
Mr Jonathan said the group was a ""local problem"" that had to be dealt with.
Boko Haram, which is fighting for the establishment of Sharia law in Nigeria, is alleged to have had contacts with al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates in North Africa, and al-Shabab in Somalia.
The BBC's Mark Doyle in Abuja says Friday's suicide attack shows Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as ""Western education is forbidden"", is getting bolder and that Nigeria has a growing security crisis.
For two years, the Islamist group has been targeting government and mounting a campaign of killings, but attacking the United Nations in the heart of the capital is a major escalation, our correspondent adds.
The bomber drove his vehicle through the headquarters' two security barriers, then crashed into the reception area before detonating the explosives.
The blast was powerful enough to bring down parts of the structure, where about 400 UN personnel work, and blow out the windows of nearby buildings.
Standing among the broken glass and twisted metal on Saturday, President Jonathan told reporters: ""I and all Nigerians are shocked.""
""Terrorist attacks on any individual or part of the world is a terrorist attack on the rest of the world,"" he added. ""Terrorists don't care about who is anywhere.""
""We will work with the UN and other world leaders to ensure that terrorism is brought under control.""
When asked by the BBC what he would do about Boko Haram, he gave no direct answer but acknowledged it posed a threat.
""Boko Haram is a local group linked up with terrorist activities and as a government, we are working on it and we will bring it under control.""
Our correspondent says Nigeria's government has tried negotiating with Boko Haram and cracking down hard, but neither tactic has worked.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said on Friday that he condemned ""this terrible act utterly"", and sent Deputy Secretary General Asha-Rose Migiro and Under-Secretary General for Security Greg Starr to Nigeria.
On Saturday, the UN's top official in Nigeria said nine of its staff were confirmed dead and that dozens were being treated in hospital.
""We have lost motivated, bright, selfless people who were working only for the good of Nigeria and the world,"" said Agathe Lawson, the UN's acting resident co-ordinator.
""Our priority now is to ensure those who are injured and the families of those who died are cared for.""
Mr Lawson said that her ""second and urgent priority"" was to ensure that UN operations continued in Africa's most populous nation.
""We will not be deterred in our mission to work to improve the lives of Nigerians. This is why we are here,"" she added.
Shortly after President Jonathan left the bomb site, agents from the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrived to help investigate.
""The FBI is on the ground at the request of the Nigerian government,"" said US embassy spokeswoman Deborah MacLean without elaborating.","Nigeria's president has promised to bring terrorism under control, during a visit to the scene of Friday's bombing at the UN's headquarters in Abuja."

If the former Nottingham Forest and Derby County defender had access to the sort of help and support he is now eager to offer young footballers, he may well have achieved a great deal more.
Now retraining as a counsellor, Charles - still best remembered for his innocent part in the infamous tackle that almost ended Paul Gascoigne's career - is determined to give something back to the sport that gave him so much.
His journey has been far from smooth, with the low point a six-month prison sentence for dangerous driving and failing to give a breath sample that was brought about by his drinking.
Following his time in the East Midlands Charles, who won two England caps, was forced to retire at the age of 32 after injury-plagued spells with Aston Villa, Benfica and West Ham. It was the injuries that led to the boozing.
""While I was playing I was disciplined,"" Charles told BBC Inside Out. ""As soon as I was injured - if it was for any length of time - I would maybe go out a little bit more than I would normally. But it wouldn't be all the time.
""I am the first to admit that I have had my issues with drinking and I am a recovering alcoholic. But my drinking was very different from someone drinking every day. It wasn't all the time, it would be the odd time that would last two or three days.
""I wasn't a typical alcoholic. I could stop and go long periods of time without drinking.
""But toward the end of my football career it would last a little bit longer - definitely. As soon as I was nearly back to full fitness, I would go back in to my disciplined life again.""

Charles has been sober for nine years. The 45-year-old is director of football at Nottingham University and is working with Priority Health - a specialist organisation to help young footballers.
And he really wants to help.
""If a lot more people were more honest and there wasn't such a stigma around alcoholics or drug addicts then a lot of people would benefit from it,"" Charles said.
""We need to encourage young players not to live with addictions and talk to people.
""I know it is hard for a young player to go to a coach or an assistant manager and say 'listen I am struggling with drinking' or gambling or whatever because they do think it could be detrimental to their careers and maybe they will not get the contract of their dreams.
""There are things away from football clubs and there are people you can speak to.
""I want people to know that if you are struggling with addiction, speak to somebody about it because it does help. You don't have to go through hell when you can address your issues a lot earlier and go on and live a normal life.""
His time in prison was the real end of his ""normal life"" and helped set him on the way to sobriety. Charles was struggling to deal with the end of his career and it was at this point that he realised things needed to change.
""Prison was definitely something that opened my eyes to being somewhere I didn't want to continue going,"" Charles said.
""I just didn't want to drink any more or feel the way I was feeling any more. I had just had enough.
""Football is very much a closed shop but I think it is something that needs to be talked about. Addiction does not pick a certain type.""
Football life for London-born Charles began brilliantly as a youngster forcing his way in to Brian Clough's Forest side at the end of the 1980s.
""It's a big thing when you actually come in to a club and you are here every day and are watching the first team play,"" Charles said.
""The Forest team had a lot of great players at the time. I still remember cleaning the boots of Johnny Metgod, Garry Birtles, Gary Mills and Gary Fleming; they were the four players I looked after.
""That was one of the biggest things I enjoyed because I got to go in to the first team dressing room and listen to what they spoke about.""
Despite all Charles achieved, it was his part in the Gazza story that still triggers the memory banks when his name crops up.
Forest reached the 1991 FA Cup final where they played a Tottenham side featuring Gascoigne and Gary Lineker.
Despite going ahead through a trademark Stuart Pearce free-kick, Brian Clough's Forest lost a thrilling match 2-1.
But the game - enthralling as it was - was overshadowed by two moments of Gazza madness. His first challenge on Garry Parker saw Gascoigne plant his foot in the Forest midfielder's chest, the second saw the Lazio-bound superstar rupture a cruciate ligament in his right knee because of his ugly lunge on Charles.
""I remember the tackle on Parks,"" Charles said. ""I thought that was worse than my one to be honest. It was just a mis-timed tackle. It is something that every professional footballer has done.
""I didn't think much of it. I know a lot was made of it but I was more disappointed with us losing the game. If you speak to a lot of the Forest lads that is one of our biggest regrets. It was a massive day for the club.""
Charles wants to ensure the young footballers he comes into contact with will only have reason to regret matters on the pitch.

"Separation talks could be completed within the two year deadline set out in Article 50, but a future relationship would take longer to negotiate, Sir Simon Fraser told BBC Newsnight.
Sir Simon said ""transitional arrangements"" would be necessary.
Prime Minister Theresa May will invoke Article 50 on Wednesday.
""It's certain that we won't have resolved everything in the period before the expiry of the Article 50 process,"" Sir Simon Fraser told BBC Newsnight.
""The EU side want to start with negotiating the terms of the separation... And the British side, on top of that, wants to move rapidly to discuss the future relationship - both political and economic - between Britain and the EU. And that is a very complex second set of negotiations.""
Because of the difficulty of defining the future relationship, Sir Simon, who held senior posts in Brussels and Whitehall before becoming the head of the diplomatic service, believes talks will soon shift to the nature of 'transitional arrangements'. This means vital questions about how the UK does business with the EU could be left unresolved far beyond 2019.
Many Brexit supporters had hoped informal negotiations with the EU could start before the Article 50 clock begins ticking this week. Negotiations are limited to two years.
But Sir Simon said the European Commission has thwarted such plans: ""There has been a very disciplined position across the EU, and I don't think that there has been a lot of informal behind the scenes discussion of the agenda or of the key issues yet.""
Sir Simon is also sceptical that the UK will be able to play off different countries among the EU's 27 countries.
""The UK has got to negotiate with the EU as a whole through the EU's appointed negotiator, which will be essentially led by the Commission.""
He added: ""I think it would be a mistake to try divide and rule because I don't think that that will work.""
While Article 50 allows up to two years to reach an agreement, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he wants the outline of a deal to be ready by autumn 2018, in the hope that it can then go before the European Parliament for ratification and member states for agreement well before the deadline is up.
But many diplomats, Sir Simon Fraser among them, believe that there will be no serious political discussions before this autumn, following the German elections.
While Brexit dominates national debate in the UK, it is a secondary issue for many European governments.
This could lead to delays in negotiations with many governments not taking positions until they have to. Combined with the complexity of the Brexit discussions, many diplomats believe that the UK could find itself close to a ""cliff edge"" without final agreement.
Sir Simon said while it was in the interest of both sides to avoid such a scenario, there was a ""risk of political ill will and turbulence - both political and economic"" if a deal is not reached within the Article 50 timeframe.
It is for this reason that Mr Barnier may want to make transitional arrangements dependent on a resolution of one of the first items on the EU's divorce agenda: getting the UK to agree to paying a bill of tens of billions into the Commission's coffers.

"Anne sent the eight-line verse to a friend in 1942.
The auction house in the Netherlands had valued the rare, handwritten note at €30,000-€50,000.
Anne is best remembered for her diaries of life as a German-born Jew in occupied Amsterdam in World War Two.
The poem was signed and dated 28 March 1942, which was less than four months before the Frank family moved into a secret apartment to hide from German forces.
Addressed ""Dear Cri-Cri"", it was given to Christiane van Maarsen, the older sister of one of Anne's best friends, Jacqueline.
The Bubb Kuyper auction house, based in the Dutch city of Haarlem, said Jacqueline van Maarsen was selling the poem because she knew her sister, who died in 2006, did not see it as a prized possession.
In a note published on the auctioneers' website, she wrote, ""My sister (nicknamed Cri-Cri) tore this page out of her poezie album and gave it to me around 1970. I know that my sister was not as attached to this verse from Anne to her as I am to the verse Anne addressed to me.""
It was common for girls of the era to collate notes from friends in scrapbooks they called poezie albums.
The first four lines of the poem, which encouraged the older sister to work hard at school, are known to have been copied from a magazine.
The second four carried on the same edifying theme, but may be Anne's original work.
The auctioneers noted that Anne switched her style of handwriting midway through writing.
Her diaries have become one the most important documents to emerge from the Holocaust. Her father published them after she died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen Nazi death camp aged 15.","A poem by Dutch schoolgirl Anne Frank written shortly before her family went into hiding from the Nazis has sold at auction for €140,000 ($148,000; £120,000), well over the estimate."
"The regulator said the bid did not comply with the laws of having its principal place of business in the Chinese territory.
The city's other carriers had also objected, it said.
Qantas said it would reconsider basing the low-cost carrier in Hong Kong.
The carrier is a three-way joint venture between Qantas Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Hong Kong investment firm Shun Tak Holdings.
""Jetstar Hong Kong cannot make its decisions independently from that of the two foreign shareholders,"" said the Air Transport Licensing Authority when handing down its decision.
It also said the city's other carriers, including Cathay Pacific and Dragon Airlines, had objected to Jetstar's application.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said the decision was disappointing for shareholders as well as ""for the travellers that Jetstar Hong Kong planned to serve"".
""It's the travelling public who have lost out, because the message from this decision is that Hong Kong appears closed to fresh aviation investment even when it is majority locally-owned and controlled,"" he said in a statement on Friday.
He added that Hong Kong was going in the opposite direction of other aviation markets in Asia that were ""opening up"".
""Given the importance of aviation to global commerce, shutting the door to new competition can only serve the vested interests already installed in that market.""
The airline, along with its partners, said it had not yet decided on whether to appeal the decision.
The joint venture was valued at $10m Australian dollars ($7.7m; Â£4.9m), according to Qantas.
Shares of Qantas were down 1.4% in Sydney in reaction to the news.","Hong Kong authorities have rejected an application by Qantas-backed Australian budget carrier Jetstar to set up a local airline, after nearly two years of deliberation."
"In a letter to media buyers, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) has threatened to strike from 2 May.
It's to do with a row over pay - writers say they have been losing revenue in recent years, 23% in the last two years alone.
Also, because so many series are getting shorter but writers contracts remain the same length, many of them find themselves locked into a contract without other work.
""Should this [strike] occur, writing for television, feature films and digital series will cease,"" the letter says.
This would be catastrophic for the major networks, which were hugely affected when the WGA went on strike for 100 days in 2007.
Many TV networks struggled to fill their schedules, which led to an increase in repeats and reality TV shows.
In light of the letter, five days of negotiations are due to begin on Monday. If they don't go well - loads of your favourite shows could become victims of the strike.
Unlike the last time, many viewers will now be able to turn to streaming services to plug the gap in new content. However for traditional TV networks and film studios, a new strike would cause chaos.
Shows which are unscripted, don't use union writers or have already wrapped filming, wouldn't generally suffer. But here are some examples of shows which would.
The genre that would be impacted most immediately would be the live entertainment and late night chat shows.
Unlike UK talk shows fronted by the likes of Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross air weekly, most US chat shows - which are also broadcast in the UK - air every night.
As you can imagine, that requires a heck of a lot of material, and therefore a heck of a lot of writers.
The likes of Jimmy Kimmel Live, Saturday Night Live and The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon would struggle to stay on air.
During the last strike, talk shows hosted by David Letterman, Jon Stewart and Conan O'Brien all ran repeats instead of airing new programmes.
Many stayed off air until the strike was over, while some returned and filled air time by ad-libbing or airing previously-recorded segments.
O'Brien, Letterman and Jay Leno even started to pay some of their regular writers out of their own pockets to provide new material during the strike.
In 2007, some networks stockpiled episodes to try and minimise the impact of the writers' strike.
A few soap operas like Days of Our Lives and All My Children had their scripts completed to last them through to January, when the strike was due to end.
Dramas such as The Wire and The Shield also completed filming their current seasons and so were unaffected.
But others floundered.
Some shows were cancelled altogether, despite having ended on a cliff hanger (you can imagine how viewers reacted to that).
Others had their seasons cut short (Pushing Daisies), had new episodes delayed (24, Entourage) or their season length shortened (30 Rock, Breaking Bad, The Big Bang Theory).
Many of the shows due to begin this summer would likely be unaffected as they're already in production or completed, such as Veep, Fear The Walking Dead and Orange Is The New Black,
But shows which are due to begin in the crucial fall season, which writers begin working on in May and June, are at severe risk.
As the new letter from the WGA states: ""Any delay in the start of work has the potential to postpone fall season premieres and reduce the amount of new programming available to advertisers and audiences.""
This would affect brand new shows as well as programmes already hugely popular with audiences like Modern Family and Empire.
Of course, a strike wouldn't just impact TV shows - films can suffer as well.
Perhaps the most obvious casualty of the last one was the slightly dodgy James Bond film, Quantum of Solace.
Hot on the heels of the hugely popular and critically acclaimed Casino Royale, expectations for Daniel Craig's second Bond film were high.
But the actor famously ended up writing some sections of his own dialogue because of the lack of writers available to work on the movie.
The franchise redeemed itself with Skyfall and Spectre, but other standalone films didn't have that luxury.
Johnny Depp adventure drama Shantaram was put on hold because of strike related script issues and was never made
Oscar-nominated musical Nine, which starred Nicole Kidman, Daniel Day-Lewis and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas, was severely delayed.
Production had to be postponed from early 2008 to the second half of the year, pushing back its scheduled release date.
And at the height of awards season, the 2008 Golden Globes were cancelled with the winners read out at a press conference as there was no one to write the host's jokes.
Thankfully a deal was reached in time to allow stars to dress up and go to the Oscars.

"Tony Tyler called for drone regulations to be put in place before any serious accidents occur.
He said the threat posed by unmanned aerial vehicles is still evolving.
""I am as excited as you are about the prospect of having pizza delivered by a drone,"" he told a conference in Singapore.
""But we cannot allow [drones] to be a hindrance or safety threat to commercial aviation,"" said Mr Tyler, director-general of the International Air Transport Association.
""The issue is real. We have plenty of pilot reports of drones where they were not expected, particularly at low altitudes around airports,"" he added. ""There is no denying that there is a real and growing threat to the safety of civilian aircraft [coming from drones].
""We need a sensible approach to regulation and a pragmatic method of enforcement for those who disregard rules and regulations and put others in danger.""
Drones were recently involved in four serious near-misses at UK airports, the UK Air Proximity Board said in January.
The board, which investigates near-miss incidents in UK airspace, said a drone had come very close to colliding with a Boeing 737 that had taken off from Stansted airport.
IATA's primary concern is drones flying at low altitudes near airports that could threaten planes taking off or landing, Rob Eagles of Iata said.
Aviation regulators also want to make sure that the radio spectrum used to control the drones does not interfere with air traffic control systems, he said.
In December the US government set up a registration system for Americans who own drones.
Anyone who has a drone must register with the Federal Aviation Administration before the device takes its first flight.
Owners have until Friday to register their details or face being fined.
The move comes after several reported incidents of drones hindering emergency services' efforts in fighting fires and other dangers.","Drones flown by the general public are ""a real and growing threat"" to civilian aircraft, the head of aviation trade body Iata has warned."
"President Nicos Anastasiades and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci met in Nicosia's neutral buffer zone.
UN envoy Espen Barth Eide said they ""shared their vision for a united Cyprus"".
Mr Akinci was elected last month. The Turkish-controlled north broke away in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup.
Since a Turkish military invasion in 1974 the island has been effectively partitioned, with the northern third inhabited by Turkish Cypriots and the southern two-thirds by Greek Cypriots.
Peace negotiations stalled last October, when the Greek Cypriots walked out in protest at the presence of a Turkish ship prospecting for natural gas off the island's south coast.
Correspondents say there are hopes that Mr Akinci, a leftist moderate, can push forward the new round of negotiations.
""The talks took place in a very positive climate and I believe that working in similar fashion, we can hope for progress,"" Associated Press quoted Mr Anastasiades as saying after Friday's UN-brokered meeting.
In an initial move, Turkish Cypriot authorities agreed to no longer require Greek Cypriots to fill in visa forms at crossing points to northern Cyprus, UN envoy Mr Eide told reporters.
Compensation for those displaced by the conflict is expected to be one of the thorniest issues in the talks.
UN peacekeeping forces estimate that 165,000 Greek Cypriots fled or were expelled from the north, and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots from the south, although the parties to the conflict say the figures are higher.
The self-declared Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is diplomatically isolated, recognised only by Turkey.","The leaders of the divided Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus have resumed peace talks amid a ""climate of optimism"", the UN mediator says."
"United ended a run of four derby defeats with a convincing 4-2 win at Old Trafford that left City with their sixth loss in their last eight games.
Pellegrini, 61, said: ""It is my responsibility and the only way we can change this is by winning games.
""I am not talking about my position. It is not important.""
City won the Premier League title last season and were level on points with leaders Chelsea in January, nine points above rivals United.
But they are now four points below United in fourth and face being dragged into a fight to secure Champions League football next season as Liverpool could close the gap to just four points with victory against Newcastle United at Anfield on Monday.
Pellegrini added: ""The only way to explain our run is that we don't have the results. We lost many points, not only in this game which was a very difficult one, but in others too.
""We played very well for 20 minutes but we must not play just for 20 minutes, we must play for the whole game in the same way.
""We are concerned but now we must try to win the next game at home to West Ham. We have been first or second the whole year and now we are fourth but United and Arsenal have to play against Chelsea. We have 18 more points to play for. We must not be dramatic.""
City faded after taking the early lead through Sergio Aguero and Pellegrini conceded that United's stirring comeback may have affected his team's fragile spirit.
""Maybe it is something we can be concerned by,"" he said. ""It is easy when you are two goals in front to play with more trust than the team that is two goals behind.
""We made important mistakes for the second goal and the third was offside but the result was a fair one.""",Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini took full responsibility for his side's alarming slump but refused to discuss his long-term future.
"About 15 students, from the 'Fossil Free QUB' group, have been occupying part of the university's administration building since Friday.
A QUB spokesperson said a review of its investment policy is taking place.
The review will be completed next spring.
The spokesperson added that the university is happy to hold discussions with Fossil Free QUB, but there would be no immediate decision taken on its investment policy outside of the review.
The Green Party Northern Ireland, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) Alliance Party, Sinn FÃ©in and People Before Profit have all expressed support for the fossil free campaign.
Belfast city Green Party NI councillor Ross Brown was at the demonstration at Queen's, and called for the university to disinvest in fossil fuels.
""There are investment indexes that exist now that exclude fossil fuels, so there's no stopping Queen's choosing those indexes and taking their money out of fossil fuels.""
The Sinn FÃ©in MLA Chris Hazzard also said the university should take action now, rather than waiting for the results of a review.
""Other universities around the world, including Sheffield, have recently done this, so it's time for Queen's to do that too,"" he said.
Meanwhile, freedom of information requests carried out by the Fossil Free QUB organisation - and seen by the BBC - show that some of Queen's money is subsequently invested in;
However, these types of investments are not unusual, according to a wealth management expert.
Ewan Boyle, director of Johnston Campbell financial advisors, told the BBC that many organisations had diverse portfolios.
""If we look at the top 100 companies in the UK, around 25% of those have a bias towards mining or oil, so avoiding those companies if you are a large investor is virtually impossible"" he said.
""Queen's are passing their money to fund managers, who are responsible for investing that money, and their primary objective is to get the best returns they possibly can.""
""It's what many pension funds, and many large organisations are doing,"" Mr Boyle added.
""Mining and oil have been huge growth areas in recent years, so that's where the fund managers are investing to get those returns.""
A Queen's spokesperson said that university business was continuing as normal, although a small number of staff in the finance office had been relocated.","A number of politicians have attended the protest calling for Queen's University, Belfast (QUB) to sell shares it holds in fossil fuel firms."

"Reporters said they appeared healthy but a little distressed after their long journey.
A circus surrendered some of the lions, while others were taken in raids.
The US-based group Animal Defenders International (ADI), which was behind the action, says almost all the lions have had teeth or claws removed.
They would not survive in the wild.
The lions are being transferred by land to the Emoya Big Cat Sanctuary, a 5,000-hectare reserve in northern South Africa. There, the lions will have drinking pools, platforms, toys and veterinary care.
""This is a hugely important rescue mission because it does make a statement around the world about the way people treat animals,"" ADI spokeswoman Jan Creamer said.
""These lions have suffered tremendously.""
The first group of nine lions was collected in Colombia's capital Bogota on a cargo plane, which then flew to Peru's capital Lima to pick up 24 more animals.
""It will be hugely satisfying to see these lions walking into the African Bush,"" ADI Vice-President Tom Phillips was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency.
The lions were freed after the use of wild animals was banned in Peru in 2011 and Colombia in 2013.
The 5,000-hectare (12,355 acres)  Emoya Big Cat Sanctuary is on private land and already houses six other rescued lions and two tigers.
The lion habitats there would be steadily expanded over the coming months as the lions became familiar with their new life and were introduced to each other, said ADI.",More than 30 lions rescued from circuses in Colombia and Peru have been flown to South Africa to start a new life in a sanctuary.
"The Plymouth towers will have cladding removed after it emerged it was made of similar material to Grenfell Tower.
It was expected to be removed within days, but authorities now say it won't be taken down until at least November.
Plymouth Community Homes says additional safety precautions are in place to ensure its residents' safety.
More on tower block cladding delay and other Devon and Cornwall stories
Chloe Brewster, 22, fled her flat in the Mount Wise Tower estate with her baby after a fire broke out in one of the blocks earlier this year.
""It's absolutely horrifying to think that it's going to be at least to the end of the year that they're going to remove the cladding,"" she said.
""There is a highly likely chance of a fire happening between now and the end of the year.
""At the end of the day they're not the ones that are having nightmares about burning to death with a baby in a tower block.""
Plymouth Community Homes said it would not follow Camden Council's decision to evacuate residents, because the Mount Wise towers have additional fires safety measures and precautions in place.
CEO John Clark said last week that the cladding would be removed ""over the next couple of days"".
But in a letter to residents on Tuesday the housing authority said specialist consultants had identified a target date for the removal of the panels by the end of November.
Labour MP Luke Pollard has also claimed that some people living in high-rise flats are being refused insurance renewals.","A young mother says she has nightmares about ""burning to death"" with her baby after work on three tower blocks was delayed."
"Norway went ahead midway through the first half when the Hegerberg sisters combined to make the breakthrough.
Andrine Hegerberg sent a free-kick into the box for sibling Ada to head past Siobhan Chamberlain from close range.
England are next in action on Tuesday when they face Sweden, the Olympic silver medallists from Rio, in Murcia.
Their best chances against Norway fell to Fara Williams and Lucy Bronze, who saw efforts from the edge of the box go over the crossbar.
Steph Houghton's shot from a corner was cleared off the line, while Ellen White had a penalty appeal turned down after she appeared to receive a shove in the penalty area.
Norway continued to push for a second goal but Chamberlain made a string of impressive saves to deny the opposition.
With the Women's Super League clubs returning from their close season break only two weeks ago, the majority of the England players are still some way from peak fitness.
Even so, with the European Championship seven months away, a defeat by quality opposition such as Norway will be a disappointment to England manager Mark Sampson.
The match was England's first since November and they appeared to lose some of the free-flowing football they were displaying in the back end of 2016.
Having failed to create a single clear-cut chance in the first half, the introduction of Millie Bright and White looked welcome in the 68th minute.
The team came to life in the closing moments, when they won a string of corners which they followed up with on-target efforts but failed to find the equaliser.
Sampson played a 3-4-3 formation and despite the defeat, England looked mostly solid across the park but lacked the creativity to find an equaliser for large part of the game.
Media playback is not supported on this device
After topping their Euro 2017 qualifying group, England came into the match on a 10-game unbeaten run and showed a gritty determination to get back into the match.
Chamberlain, deputising for the injured Karen Bardsley, made a string of impressive saves to prevent England from going further behind.
Jade Moore once again showed her battling qualities and her ability to control play in the middle of the field, while on the left wing Demi Stokes displayed pace and power.
For some players, this training camp could be one of their last chances to impress before the summer and Sampson is expected to make a number of changes ahead of Tuesday's match against Sweden.
Striker Danielle Carter, who did not play against Norway, will miss the Sweden game with a hamstring injury.
The Arsenal striker, 23, will remain with the squad in La Manga. Chelsea defender Hannah Blundell has been called up as a replacement.

"Travis was convicted in September of indecently assaulting a woman and given a three month sentence suspended for two years.
A hearing at Southwark Crown Court heard that he had racked up a taxi fare bill of £4,456 during his trials.
He was awarded travel costs, limited to the value of a day return train ticket and £50 for a taxi, and hotel costs.
Stephen Vullo QC, representing Travis, made the defendant's costs application and said his client had been ""financially devastated"" by trials in February and September last year.
""He has no money left whatsoever,"" he said.
""He is now below zero.""
Mr Vullo also claimed £630 in hotel accommodation, and £246 for travel to legal conferences, and asked for a total of £5,332 towards Travis's costs.
Judge Leonard ruled that Travis could claim the costs of a daily return train ticket from Aylesbury to Marylebone, which the judge said cost £61.40, as well as £50 a day for reasonable taxi costs from the station.
He allowed the hotel costs.
Referring to Travis's back problems, Judge Leonard said: ""His infirmity was such that the benefit from the train, to get up from his seat rather than remain in it, is something that could only have been achieved on a train, not a car.""
The defence estimated that Travis travelled from his home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, to court on 37 days, which means he could be entitled to £4,121.80.
The number of days will be confirmed with the court at a later stage.
Prosecutor Joshua Munro argued the costs were not ""reasonable"" expenses for the taxpayer to fund.
Travis was cleared of 12 counts of indecent assault after a trial in February 2014.
The jury was unable to decide on verdicts on an additional count of indecent assault and one count of sexual assault and a retrial was ordered.
The Crown Prosecution Service added one more count of indecent assault, the offence of which he was eventually convicted, on the indictment for the September 2014 trial.
Travis was cleared of the indecent assault on which he was retried, and after a second jury was unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charge, Judge Anthony Leonard QC, directed a not guilty verdict.","Former BBC Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis was ""financially ruined"" by his lengthy legal battles, a court has heard."
"Greater Manchester Police said the corrosive liquid hit a man and a woman in the eyes on Ashton Old Road, Openshaw, Manchester on Friday evening.
Shortly afterwards, bleach was thrown at a second man on the same road by a passenger in a silver Ford Fiesta heading towards Audenshaw.
Police said those affected were ""lucky"" to escape serious injury.
Insp Cherie Dunn, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ""I am so thankful that none of the victims of these senseless attacks has been seriously injured.
""We could easily have been dealing with life-changing injuries.
""Anyone thinking that throwing bleach at people is funny or that a crime like this does not have consequences couldn't be more wrong.
""The victim's here were lucky. Bleach attacks could have had catastrophic consequences.""",A pregnant woman was among three people targeted when bleach was thrown from a car in two separate attacks.
"The visitors led at the break through Helder Costa's penalty after Dave Edwards was felled by Jon McLaughlin.
Burton piled on the pressure after half-time and levelled when former Wolves winger Michael Kightly marked his debut by tapping in from two yards.
Woodrow hooked in the winner deep in injury time after Wolves failed to clear a corner.
Burton's win means they remain three points clear of the Championship relegation zone after third-from-bottom Blackburn also snatched a late victory over QPR, while Wolves drop to 18th after Nottingham Forest's injury-time win over Aston Villa.
In a scrappy first half of few chances, Lasse Vigen Christensen, on loan from Fulham like Woodrow, volleyed over Tom Flanagan's cross, while Wolves striker Nouha Dicko saw a shot tipped around the post by McLaughlin.
The visitors finally took the lead five minutes before the break when Costa drilled his spot-kick high into the net after McLaughlin brought down Edwards.
But Paul Lambert's side struggled to create anything of note after the break as Burton dominated.
Carl Ikeme tipped a Kightly shot around the post and a free-kick over the bar before the winger, who joined on loan from Burnley on deadline day, finally claimed the equaliser by converting Marvin Sordell's pass.
And Nigel Clough's side, who grabbed an injury-time equaliser when the two sides drew 1-1 at Molineux in September, got the winner when Woodrow turned in Flanagan's header from close range in the fourth minute of stoppage time.
Burton manager Nigel Clough: ""It's about time we had one go in our favour. We have had enough heartaches to last us three seasons in the first 20-odd games.
""It's about the first time anything has really broken for us in the last minute in the penalty area. The corner has come in and just dropped to two of our lads and Cauley has ended up putting it in.
""The two new lads get the goals and it makes a difference when you can bring a few bodies in during January.
""We have created a few chances throughout the season, but it's nice now to have people who can finish them off.""
Wolves head coach Paul Lambert told BBC WM: ""In the first half I thought we did a lot with the ball. We got the lead and it gives you something to go with at half-time
""But in the second half we were not the same and we allowed Burton to come back into the game.
""The first goal is poor from our point of view, because it's too easy for them to get through our defence. For the second, our marking was not good enough at the set play.
""We have set ourselves such a high standard so the disappointment is there for everybody today. Sometimes you need a reality check, and today we just weren't good enough.""

"The bodies of the state's first mental institution - called the Insane Asylum - stretch across 20 acres of campus where administrators want to build.
Officials predict that it may cost up to $21m (Â£16m) to exhume and rebury each body - more than $3,000 for each.
The campus medical centre, where the bodies have been discovered, is looking at cheaper alternatives.
The university hopes to bring the total cost down by handling the exhumations in-house, the Clarion-Ledger newspaper reports.
They predict that it can be done for $400,000 per year over the next eight years.
They also hope to create a memorial and laboratory where students can study the patients' remains, as well as remnants of clothes and wood unearthed in the process.
A group of academics have formed a consortium dedicated to studying the remains.
""We have inherited these patients,"" said Ralph Didlake, who oversees the campus Center for Bioethics and Medical Humanities.
""We want to show them care and respectful management,"" he told the Clarion-Ledger.
""It would be a unique resource for Mississippi,"" Molly Zuckerman, a professor of anthropology, told the newspaper.
""It would make Mississippi a national centre on historical records relating to health in the pre-modern period, particularly those being institutionalised.""
The Insane Asylum was completed in 1855 and operated until 1935. Before then, patients with mental illnesses were often kept chained in jails and attics of homes.
According to records, of the 1,376 patients admitted between 1855 and 1877, more than one in five died.
After the US Civil War the facility expanded dramatically, eventually housing about 6,000 patients during its peak.
The first coffins were discovered by the university in 2013 while constructing a road near campus.
In 2014 officials found more than 1,000 coffins while building a parking garage.","The remains of at least 7,000 people may be buried beneath the University of Mississippi, officials estimate."
"Specialist micro-engineer Graham Short visited the Dickinson & Morris Ye Olde Pork Pie Shoppe in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, on Friday.
It follows the use of one of the special notes at a bakery in Kelso, Scotland, and also a cafe in Wales.
The final note will be spent this week in Northern Ireland.
Updates on this story and more from Leicestershire
Mr Short, from Birmingham, came up with the idea of engraving a 5mm portrait of Pride and Prejudice author Austen on the transparent part of the new plastic Bank of England £5 notes to mark the 200th anniversary of Austen's death next year.
He has included a different quote around each one, ensuring that each note is unique.
Anyone who finds one of the notes has been advised to contact the Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, which launched the project.
The Bank of England's website states that it is illegal to deface bank notes under the Currency & Banknotes Act 1928.
In a statement, the gallery said it had contacted the Bank of England, which informed them that the notes were still legal tender.
Mr Huggins-Haig told BBC Scotland all of Mr Short's work has an insurance valuation of about £50,000. He also described the notes as like ""the Willy Wonka golden ticket"".
Mr Short's last work - a minute picture of the Queen on a pinhead - sold for £100,000.
The four notes have the following serial numbers and quotes:
Mr Short, 70, said: ""As I enjoy pork pies, I thought where better to spend the English note than in Melton Mowbray?""
Stephen Hallam, from the shop, told the BBC every £5 note is not ""inspected with a magnifying glass"", but admitted the notes in the shop were ""scrutinised"" after they were told on Monday that Mr Short had visited the shop.
However, the special note could not be found.
""I'm still here making pork pies... I'm not flying off to Barbados,"" Mr Hallam said.
Mr Short told BBC Radio Wales' Jason Mohammad programme he chose Square Café in Blackwood High Street in Caerphilly because that was where his mother was born in 1909.

"The woman, in her early 20s, was rescued by RNLI lifeguards who were on duty for the first day of the season at Newquay's Fistral beach.
Lewis Timson, lifeguard supervisor, said the surfer's longboard leash snapped while she was competing in the Natty Surf Jam one-day event.
He described conditions at sea as ""pretty wild"".
The ""distressed"" woman, who is thought to be from Newquay, was taken ashore, but was not believed to need hospital treatment.
The festival was arranged in memory of 25-year-old local surfer Nathaniel Loney who died after battling severe depression and bi-polar disorder.

Wenger's contract is due to expire at the end of the season but he has repeatedly expressed his desire to continue in the role he has held since 1996.
Asked whether he would now sign a new deal, he said: ""That should normally happen yes, and we are in very normal circumstances. It was never a question of leaving. It was a question of doing the right job for this football club.""
James Chester and Curtis Davies put Hull two up inside eight minutes but Santi Cazorla pulled a goal back before half-time. Laurent Koscielny equalised to send the game into extra time, when Aaron Ramsey scored the winner.
Wenger, who won the FA Cup for the fifth time in his Arsenal career, said: ""It was more important today than all the others. Twice we had won the double, so we had already won something and were not under the pressure we were under here.
""It is a feeling of relief and happiness as we were under severe pressure to win and we didn't start well of course. Hull started stronger and you could see we were hesitant. We demonstrated how to respond to being 2-0 down but we also demonstrated how not to start an FA Cup final.
""It is a big moment to win and when it happens after a long time it sometimes comes with suffering so it was a great moment.""

Former manager George Graham, who led Arsenal to the league title in 1989 and 1991, said the club need to bring in ""three quality players"" if they are going to challenge for top-flight honours, including a midfield dynamo in the mould of 1998 World Cup winner Patrick Vieira.
""In midfield there's an embarrassment of riches, they're all very similar and I think they need a strong, Vieira type player who leads the team,"" the Scot told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek programme.
""Up front, there's no question, that's been their failing this season. They've only got one out-and-out centre-forward and they need a class forward to add to the team.""
Like Wenger, Arsenal right-back Bacary Sagna is also out of contract and has been linked with a move to Manchester City.
""I think until we start pressuring the ball much better than we're doing we'll remain vulnerable. A good team to watch, but vulnerable against the better teams.""
Asked if the Cup final was his last game for Arsenal, he said: ""I don't know to be honest, as everyone says I have been talking with the club for a long time and we will try to find a solution, but I don't know what that will be.""
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta praised his team's ""desire"" to fight back and hailed the scorer of the winning goal.
""It's unbelievable, when you go 2-0 down it is really rare to come back and win the Cup,"" he said.

"The Environmental Audit Committee (EAC) says the current proposals are ""unnecessarily complicated"".
Their report says that bans in Ireland and Wales were simpler and have significantly reduced the impact of plastic bags on the environment.
Over eight billion disposable carrier bags are used in England every year.
Last September, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg announced plans for a single use plastic bag charge in England that would come into effect after the 2015 election.
Mr Clegg highlighted the threat of plastic bags to marine life and the countryside. The money raised by the levy would go to charity, he said, and the time to act was now.
""This is not a new problem. We've waited too long for action. That's why I am drawing a line under the issue now. The charge will be implemented sensibly - small businesses will be exempt.""
But it is the planned exemptions and other rules that have raised the hackles of the EAC.
The proposals have been drawn up by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
They want the 5p charge to apply only to supermarkets and larger stores. Most small shops and takeaway outlets would not have to pay the cost.
Defra says that the charge should not be a burden to small businesses.
As well as this exemption, Defra does not want the charge to apply to biodegradable bags. Paper bags and reusable ""bags for life"" will also avoid the levy.
But the EAC believe these rules are making the proposal too complex.
""Ministers have managed to make a complete mess of their planned carrier bags charge by making it unnecessarily complicated,"" said Joan Walley MP, chair of the committee.
""Carrier bags litter our streets and harm wildlife, and the government is right to want to reduce their use. But Defra seems to have made decisions about the design of this scheme that were based more on wishful thinking than hard evidence.""
The MPs' report said many trade bodies representing small retailers were opposed to the exemption as it was confusing for consumers.
The Association of Convenience Stores said the best way of tackling the issue was to ensure that every shop charged for plastic bags.
""We urge the government to listen to the recommendations of the Environmental Audit Committee and ensure that convenience stores are not left out of the carrier bag charge,"" said ACS chief executive James Lowman.
The EAC said that exempting paper bags was also misguided as it would weaken the message that consumers should recycle their plastic.
The idea that biodegradable bags should avoid the charge was also a bad idea, said the EAC, as they say they are not as green as they sound.
In evidence before the committee, Jessica Baker from the British Plastics Federation recycling group, said an exemption on biodegradable bags would be ""disastrous.""
There were also concerns that biodegradable material still presented a threat to wildlife, as it took time to decay.
A Defra spokesman defended the planned exemptions, saying: ""Paper bags make up only a small proportion of carrier bags and break down naturally. Biodegradable bags will only be exempt if they are genuinely biodegradable - currently such a bag does not exist.""
The MPs said that England should follow the example of Wales and the Irish Republic and introduce a straightforward scheme without exemptions.
The committee's concerns were echoed by the Keep Britain Tidy campaign group.
""It's a no brainer of an issue - it's quite clear. In Wales where there is a flat charge across the board, bag consumption went down by 70%,"" said Andy Walker
""Unfortunately the government is overcomplicating this, we have a perfect model in Wales that is doing the job it was brought in to do and the government should implement it.""
Friends of the Earth said the introduction of a plastic bag charge was a small step in the right direction but it was insignificant in terms of dealing with the scale of waste.
""Ministers must take urgent steps to slash waste and turn it into valuable resources, and save some of the phenomenal £650m a year we squander burying and burning reusable and recyclable materials,"" said Michael Warhurst from the group.
The government expects the charge to raise around £70m for charity, which shops will donate directly. The EAC wants the £19 million that will be raised as VAT from the charge to also go to environmental good causes.

"In a statement, Pyongyang warned that South Korea's ultimatum would ""lead to no good results"".
On Thursday, Seoul gave the North 24 hours to agree to talks on the Kaesong Industrial Complex, warning of ""grave measures"" if its offer was ignored.
South Korea's president later held a meeting with top officials to discuss next steps, Yonhap reported.
The stoppage was taking a heavy toll on South Korean firms, the agency quoted her as saying.
A statement from the Unification Ministry was expected shortly, a separate report said.
North-South tensions are high following Pyongyang's nuclear test in February and the subsequent imposition of expanded UN sanctions.
The Kaesong complex, launched in 2003 as a sign of North-South co-operation, is located just inside North Korea. It is the biggest contributor to inter-Korean trade and provides the North with much-needed hard currency.
Q&A: Kaesong Industrial Complex
Analysis: The North Korea threat
Missile defences in the region
Picking apart the bluster
But Pyongyang blocked South Korean access to the site and pulled out its 53,000 workers earlier this month, amid a series of threats and strong rhetoric from the communist state.
""Pyongyang will be the first to take tough action if the South insists on worsening the situation at the border town,"" North Korea's National Defense Commission said in a statement.
""The kind of ultimatum made by the South the day before will only lead to no good results"".
The remaining 175 South Koreans still in the complex are believed to be running out of food and medicines, because the North has refused to allow fresh supplies from the South into the industrial park.
The South Korean government has refused to spell out what measures it may take, but there is speculation that it may be considering pulling out its remaining citizens, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul reports.
But that would leave South Korean assets open to seizure by the North Korean authorities, as happened before at a moth-balled tourism site run by the two countries, our correspondent adds.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was aware of the South's call for talks, and ""sincerely [hoped] the operation of the complex [could] return to normal as soon as possible through dialogue,"" a UN spokesman said on Thursday.",North Korea has rejected Seoul's call for talks on resuming operations at a joint industrial zone.
"The six-year strategy aims to produce 15 new cars or derivatives of existing models and lift annual sales to as much as 5,000 cars, from 1,600.
At least half of the cars will have hybrid engine technology.
McLaren Automotive, which draws on technology used by the F1 racing team, was launched just six years ago.
Mike Flewitt, McLaren Automotive's chief executive, told the BBC: ""This business plan confirms that McLaren Automotive will remain proudly and fiercely independent by continuing to build the world's finest two-seater sports and supercars.""
But he added that plan, called Track 22, was also about broadening the Uk supercar maker's customer base with a new range of cars more attractive to the rich - rather than just the super-rich.
The company is responsible for supercars including the £1m petrol-electric hybrid McLaren P1, but has already started introducing cheaper models.
This includes the launch at the Geneva Motor Show of the £150,000-plus 570GT, which is pitched at some rival cars produced by Ferrari and Porsche.
Rather than being a racing machine, Mr Flewitt says the 570GT is designed to give a more relaxed drive, and has been designed with a more comfortable suspension. It also has more luggage capacity.
""We see this [car] as being very easy to drive on a day-to-day basis,"" Mr Flewitt said.
About a quarter of the new £1bn investment will go directly into research and development, Mr Flewitt said. This will include work on an all-electric prototype. Electric sportscar technology is advancing fast, led by the likes of Tesla.
He also hopes that the new range of cars will bring down the age profile of a typical McLaren buyer, which is 40-plus in Europe. However, the typical Chinese buyer is in his or her 20s.
The Track 22 plan will involve McLaren Automotive adding about 500 staff to its existing 1,500. A second production shift has already started at the company's factory at Woking, Surrey, and a recruitment drive has begun.
Many of the jobs will be skilled engineering roles. Mr Flewitt said the market for good engineers is ""undoubtedly getting more competitive."" But he added: ""Luckily, McLaren is an attractive brand to come and work for.""
More than 90% of McLaren's output is for export, and the company has seen sales fall in China as the economy slows.
Is he worried about the health of the global economy? ""You worry about it all the time. The strategy we took was to make sure we had broad distribution.
""We sell cars into 30 markets, with 82 dealerships. As one market comes down - China has dropped this year and last year - other markets strengthen,"" he said.","McLaren Automotive, part of the F1 group, has unveiled a £1bn expansion plan to produce up to 15 new models and recruit 500 staff."

"The Gunners were extremely poor and were outplayed for long periods at home, but they still picked up a point and actually created enough chances to win the match because of the brilliance of Mesut Ozil.
I would not even say Ozil had a particularly good game but he got his side out of jail with his cross for Kieran Gibbs' equaliser.
Ozil had already provided two balls from a free-kick and a corner that Olivier Giroud should have scored from - he hit the bar with his first header and sent the second one wide.
Tottenham knew how dangerous he was because they stopped him from getting on the ball in open play until the final 15 minutes, but his magic touch was still able to rescue Arsenal from what would have been a very bad defeat.
Ozil had already made 47 chances this season going into Sunday's game, the most in the Premier League alongside West Ham's Dimitri Payet. That works out at an average of almost five a game in each of his previous 10 appearances.
In the first half at Emirates Stadium, however, the German did not even have a sniff of creating an opening in open play.
That was because, from the off, Spurs had the perfect game plan. They identified Arsenal's best two players as Ozil and Alexis Sanchez and they stopped their supply at source, pressing high to stop the Gunners from building from the back.
Any time Ozil, Sanchez or Santi Cazorla did get the ball, they had two or three men on them straight away and they took them completely out of the game. Ozil dropped deep to get the ball and could not do any damage from there.
It was only in the last 25 minutes that Ozil began to get any time in possession in the Tottenham half, and he made it count.
I think he is at his most deadly when he picks up the ball when an initial attack has been cleared. The defence pushes up and Ozil is just waiting for them to do that so he can deliver it into the space they leave behind.
I have seen it happen time and time again and it was a similar story on Sunday when he picked up the ball and spotted Gibbs's run to the far post.
It was his 10th assist of the campaign, four more than anyone else, and he set a Premier League record for making a goal in six successive games in the same season.
Some people still seem to have the perception that Ozil is lazy, or a luxury player, so it is worth highlighting again how hard he actually works.
He does more work for the Arsenal team than any other midfielder or forward bar Aaron Ramsey and covers a lot of ground right across the pitch.
I think it is easy to get the wrong idea because of his style on the ball. Someone like Alexis Sanchez looks busier because he does a lot of one-twos and plays with more urgency.
It is great to play it quick and early, either one-touch or two-touch like Sanchez often does, but there is nothing wrong with being different.
Ozil has the imagination to hold on to it a little bit longer because he knows the picture will change if the defence are anticipating a one-two or an early ball, and that might leave him some space.
So he is not lazy, either off the ball or on it. Even if he was, what he brings to the team means his team-mates would not mind.
When I was in Tottenham's midfield with Rafael van der Vaart, or a few years earlier when we had Dimitar Berbatov up front, I was prepared to work harder just to get the ball to them - Rafa would create a lot of chances every game and Berba would stick a lot away.
It was not just me. The whole team were prepared to do more work than them because, collectively, we knew those players were going to win us games.
The really brilliant thing about Spurs for most of the match was that they did not allow him into the game, and it was one of the reasons Arsenal found it so difficult to get going.
I played in 11 north London derbies for Spurs and I would have been devastated walking off the Emirates pitch with only a point on Sunday.

Tottenham completely dominated, but Arsenal were always going to get at least one chance. I always felt Spurs would need that second goal, and so it proved.
It was so close to being a complete performance from Mauricio Pochettino's side - in terms of their pressing, their aggression and their creativity it was absolutely spot on.
The only thing they were lacking was a killer instinct when they were 1-0 up and creating further chances. They need to be able to put those kinds of games to bed when they have bossed them.
Pochettino will be hugely disappointed to only draw the game but it was still a massive statement of intent by his team.
Everyone at the club will want to stay under the radar so they probably will not appreciate me saying this on Match of the Day 2, but I am certain they will finish in the top four this season.

A lot of that is down to Pochettino's training methods and his willingness to use young players. It means they have got energy and pace all over the pitch. They look as fit and strong as any team I have seen this season.
Defensively they look solid - the only worry they had earlier in the season was over Harry Kane's form, but now he is banging in the goals again.
Spurs have been getting better every week and it looks to me like they are close to the peak of their powers. They deserve to be in the top four.

"The human body is teeming with thousands of species of microbes that affect health.
A study showed that transplanting gut bacteria from obese people into mice led to the animals gaining weight, while bacteria from lean people kept them slim.
The findings were published in Science.
Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine, Missouri, took gut bacteria from pairs of twins - one obese, one thin.
The bacteria were then put into mice which had grown up in completely sterile environments and had no gut bacteria of their own.
Mice with the obese twin's bacteria became heavier and put on more fat than mice given bacteria from a lean twin - and it was not down to the amount of food being eaten.
There were differences in the number and types of bacteria species from the lean and obese twin.
Overall it seemed those from a lean twin were better at breaking down fibre into short-chain fatty acids. It meant the body was taking up more energy from the gut, but the chemicals were preventing fatty tissue from building up and increased the amount of energy being burned.
One of the researchers, Prof Jeffrey Gordon, told the BBC's Science in Action programme: ""We don't dine alone, we dine with trillions of friends - we have to consider the microbes which live in our gut.""
However, the diet was also important for creating the right conditions for the lean twin's bacteria to flourish. A bacterial obesity therapy seems unlikely to work alongside a a diet of greasy burgers.
Think you're all human? You may need to think again.
For every cell that makes up the human body there are 10 bacteria living on and in it.
This diversity of life is called the microbiome and it is no surprise that it affects our health.
There have even been some patients who have had faecal transplants in an attempt to change the nature of their gut bacteria.
Patients with C. difficile infections have an imbalance of bacteria which antibiotics sometimes fail to treat.
Some medical reports suggest that samples taken from a healthy gut and piped into the patient can cure the infection.
How big an impact adjusting the microbiome could have on our lives is still debated, but it is an exciting field of research.
Do faecal transplants have a medical role?
First census of bugs living on us
Keeping both sets of mice in the same cage kept them both lean if they were fed a low-fat, high-fibre diet. Mice are coprophagic, meaning they eat each other's droppings, and the lean twin's bacteria were passed into the mice which started with bacteria that should have made them obese.
However, a high-fat, low-fibre diet meant the mice still piled on the pounds.
A human obesity treatment is unlikely to use transplants of thousands of species of bacteria from lean people's guts as it carries the risk of also transferring infectious diseases.
Instead a search for the exact mix of bacteria which benefit weight - and the right foods to promote their growth - is more likely.
Prof Gordon said the next steps in the field would be ""trying to figure out how general these effects are, what diet ingredients may promote their beneficial activities and to look forward to a time when food and the value of food is considered in light of the microbes that live in our gut - that foods will have to be designed from the inside out as well as from the outside in.""
Commenting on the research, Prof Julian Parkhill, from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said he expected a future when manipulating bacteria was a part of obesity treatment.
""There's a lot of work to do, but this is proof of concept that bacteria in the gut can modulate obesity in adults, but it is diet-dependent,"" he said.
He added that changing bacteria was a promising field for other diseases.
He told the BBC: ""It's an exciting new area, but I think we need to be careful in promoting it as a cure-all.
""It's clear in specific areas - inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, Crohn's - the microbiome is going to be important.""","Bacteria living in our guts seem to be affecting our waistlines and harnessing them could lead to new ways of shedding the pounds, US research suggests."
"A sound defensive display helped Atletico earn a 1-0 first-leg advantage over Bayern Munich in the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday.
Atletico, the 2014 Spanish champions, knocked out La Liga title rivals Barcelona in the last eight.
Allardyce said: ""'He defends too much' - that's what he'd get here.""
Bundesliga leaders Bayern dominated the second half after Saul Niguez's sublime solo goal had given the La Liga side an early lead, but Atletico's defence blunted their attack.
Allardyce, whose own methods have been labelled as dour in the past, added: ""It's an art, defending - everybody has forgotten that. It's a tactical art to be able to sense danger and block people's crosses and get your toe in without fouling them now and they are very, very good at it indeed.
""The whole team buys into it. You see Fernando Torres on the edge of his own box defending. You never saw that at Liverpool or Chelsea.
""That's how good the manager is and that's why they are successful. They are successful because they concede fewer goals than everybody else and only need one to win.
""Now, everybody can say 'well, that's not entertaining', but everybody is eulogising Simeone's tactics now. I wouldn't think they would do that in the Premier League so much.""
Atletico are only behind Barca in La Liga on head-to-head record with three games left.
Sunderland have collected three clean sheets in their last four games and the manager said extending that defensive record over the four remaining league matches was key to relegation survival.
The Black Cats - who moved out of the relegation zone last weekend but only on goal difference - play Stoke on Saturday.
""At the moment, if we keep those clean sheet ratios going in the next four games, I am convinced we will stay up,"" added the 61-year-old.","Atletico Madrid boss Diego Simeone would be labelled ""boring"" if he were managing in the Premier League, says Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce."
"North Korea will launch the rocket to mark the 100th birthday of its late Great Leader Kim Il-sung in April, state media reported.
The US said the launch would threaten regional security and Russia described the plan as a ""serious concern"".
The move is seen as violating UN Security Council resolutions.
A spokesman for the Korean Committee for Space Technology said that the launch would take place between 12 and 16 April.
US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called North Korea's announcement ""highly provocative"" and urged the country to abide by its international obligations.
""Such a missile launch would pose a threat to regional security and would also be inconsistent with North Korea's recent undertaking to refrain from long-range missile launches,"" she said in a statement.
A US state department spokesperson said it would be ""hard to imagine"" giving food aid to North Korea, as previously agreed, if Pyongyang went ahead with the rocket launch.
Neighbour South Korea said such a move would be a ""clear violation"" of UN Security Council Resolutions passed after a similar launch in 2009.
""It would be a grave provocation threatening the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and north-east Asia,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
Japan is particularly concerned as North Korea's April 2009 rocket was launched over the country.
The country's chief cabinet secretary, Osamu Fujimura, told a news conference on Friday that Japan had set up a crisis management taskforce to monitor the situation and was co-operating with the US and South Korea.
""We believe a launch would be a move to interfere with our effort toward a dialogue, and we strongly urge North Korea not to carry out a satellite launch,"" he said.
Last month, Pyongyang agreed to suspend long-range missile tests.
The agreement was part of a deal for the United States to supply 240,000 tonnes of food aid to North Korea.
It also agreed to suspend uranium enrichment and to allow back UN weapons inspectors as part of the deal.
In the launch three years ago, Pyongyang said the satellite made it into orbit and characterised it as a test of its satellite technology.
The move drew condemnation from the US and South Korea and led to the UN resolutions prohibiting the North from nuclear and ballistic missile activity.
Foreign officials said there were no indications that a satellite had reached space and that the launch was a cover for Pyongyang to test long-range missile technology.
The launch next month of a ''working satellite'', the Kwangmyongsong-3, is an opportunity for ''putting the country's technology of space use for peaceful purposes on a higher stage'', said a North Korean spokesman.
The rocket would be launched from the Solace Satellite Launching Station in Cholsan county, North Pyongan province on the country's west coast.
State media also reported that the North has already launched two experimental satellites.",The US and regional neighbours of North Korea have condemned Pyongyang's plans to launch a rocket-mounted satellite as an act of provocation.

"The change, introduced on 1 May, means google.ps now displays ""Palestine"" in Arabic and English under Google's logo.
Using the word Palestine is controversial for some. Israeli policy is that the borders of a Palestinian state are yet to be agreed.
In November, the UN gave Palestine the status of ""non-member observer state"".
The decision by the General Assembly was strongly opposed by Israel and the United States. Previously, Palestine only had ""observer entity"" status.
It followed an unsuccessful Palestinian bid to join the international body as a full member state in 2011 because of a lack of support in the UN Security Council.
Palestinians in general seek recognition for the state they are trying to establish and the adoption of the name Palestine.
Israel considers any formal use of the word Palestine as pre-judging the outcome of currently stalled peace talks. In much of Israel's official terminology the West Bank is referred to as Judea and Samaria.
In a statement given to the BBC on Friday, Google spokesman Nathan Tyler said: ""We're changing the name 'Palestinian Territories' to 'Palestine' across our products. We consult a number of sources and authorities when naming countries.
""In this case, we are following the lead of the UN, Icann [the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers], ISO [International Organisation for Standardisation] and other international organisations.""

""This is a step in the right direction, a timely step and one that encourages others to join in and give the right definition and name for Palestine instead of Palestinian territories,"" Dr Sabri Saidam, advisor to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, told the BBC.
""Most of the traffic that happens now happens in the virtual world and this means putting Palestine on the virtual map as well as on the geographic maps,"" he added.

Tests were scheduled in Samoa and Tonga in June, but they have confirmed games could yet be moved to New Zealand.
The Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) say it wants to play on the islands, but will pursue alternatives if guarantees over player welfare are not met.
""There is no issue with Samoa as a venue,"" World Rugby told BBC Wales.
Wales are scheduled to play against Samoa on 24 June 2017 at Apia Park, Apia.

World Rugby helped with appropriate medical cover when New Zealand played Samoa in Apia in 2015.
A delegation from World Rugby is scheduled to travel to Tonga and Samoa to assess whether facilities in each country are fit for purpose.
""Several other international sides have played in Samoa successfully in recent years,"" World Rugby explained.
""As regards Tonga, a new venue is due to be constructed there and we need to assess whether it will be completed in time for the fixture to take place as planned.
""In addition, from a due diligence point of view, we will be conducting a site visit in Tonga within the coming weeks to ensure that other facilities in Tonga are of the appropriate level to host a match of this nature.
""This would include accommodation, training facilities and medical provisions. As always, our number-one priority is player welfare.
""No decision has yet been taken on this. By way of contingency, it is possible the match could take place in Auckland if we cannot proceed with Tonga.""

Wyke profited from two errors from Bolton goalkeeper Ben Alnwick to take his tally to three goals in four games since signing from Carlisle.

"Daniel Young, 30, was attacked in Kendor Gardens near Morden Underground station shortly after 08:00 GMT on Tuesday.
A post-mortem examination found he died from a stab wound.
A 35-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently in custody.
On the day of the attack a 26-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and wasting police time. He has been bailed.
Mr Young, originally from Paignton in Devon, was attacked as he made his way to the London Campus of Coventry University for the second day of a new job.
He was attacked in a park used by commuters as a short cut to Morden Tube station and Morden Road tram stop.
It happened less than 40 minutes after a 23-year-old man was stabbed in the buttocks in nearby Lewis Road.
Scotland Yard said it was investigating whether the two attacks were linked and trying to establish the motive and whether the attacker was known to Mr Young.
Meanwhile, an online fundraising page apparently set up in memory of Mr Young has been removed after his family reportedly said they had no knowledge of it.
Police said they understood that the donations made through the Gofundme page would be refunded. The Met's Cyber Crime Unit is investigating.
On Facebook, Mr Young's brother Simon wrote: ""My Brother. My friend. I'm still wrapping my head round this, still hoping/wishing it's a sick joke.

The US says Belmokhtar was targeted and the strike was successful, but it is assessing the operation's results and would give details ""as appropriate"".
Mokhtar Belmokhtar's death has been reported many times in the past.
Born in Algeria, Belmokhtar was a former senior figure in al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), but left to form his own militia.
He gained notoriety with the attack on the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria in 2013, when about 800 people were taken hostage and 40 killed, most of them foreigners, including six Britons and three Americans.

"The 18 sketches are by artist Donald McGill who produced more than 12,000 original artworks for the postcard industry between 1904 and 1962.
Along with a pun-filled caption, the pencil sketches include stamped approval by the censorship board.

Described as the ""king of the saucy postcard"", McGill produced thousands of artworks and an estimated 200 million postcards were printed and sold.

Wales have been buoyed by the success of Arsenal midfielder Ramsey and Real Madrid forward Bale in 2016 as they reached the semi-finals of the European Championships, their first international tournament for 58 years.
Bradshaw, who has scored three goals in 19 appearances for the Tykes this season, puts the success of the pair down to two factors.
""You watch them train and you watch them play and you try to pick their brains about how they managed to get to that level,"" he said.
""A lot of it is natural ability and natural talent, but the thing that strikes me is their hunger; their hunger to want to improve even though Gareth's playing for Real Madrid and he's a massive part of his country's team.""
Bradshaw says he was ""gutted"" to miss out on Wales' memorable Euro 2016 campaign after a calf injury ruled him out of contention.

"The ancient creature has been preserved in exquisite detail, providing the oldest-known record of hedgehog-like spines and mammalian internal organs.
The discovery is published in the journal Nature.
The creature, called Spinolestes xenarthrosus, was unearthed in Las Hoyas Quarry in central Spain.
Study co-author Dr Zhe-Xi Luo, from the University of Chicago, US, said: ""Spinolestes is a spectacular find.
""It is stunning to see almost perfectly preserved skin and hair structures fossilized in microscopic detail in such an old fossil.
""This Cretaceous furball displays the entire structural diversity of modern mammalian skin and hairs.""
The specimen's liver, lung and diaphragm tissues were found intact, as well as fur, spines and scales.
""Normally you find bones and you find skeletons - and there are many, many fossil mammal skeletons found, but never these soft parts in such great detail,"" explained Prof Thomas Martin, from the University of Bonn, Germany.
The creature was small, somewhere between the size of a mouse and a rat, weighing about 50-70g.
It had big ears and a pointy face, with a short mane and a soft fuzzy belly. It was most likely ground dwelling and ate insects.
""It is cute, very cute,"" said Prof Martin.  ""It looked like a modern spiny mouse, which is also quite cute.""
But in addition to its adorable attributes, Spinolestes also had a defensive side.
It had small spiky spines on its lower back, as well as scales similar to an armadillo's, helping it to fend of predators.
""If a predator comes and bites it on the back, then the spines are easily shed and the predator is left behind with a mouth full of spines, so it can escape"" said Prof Martin.
Potential predators probably included small dinosaurs, which have also been unearthed from the same site in Spain.
Crocodiles, salamanders, frogs, birds and insects have also been found there.
And while central Spain is hot and dry today, 125 million years ago it would have been a lush tropical wetland.
""These animals lived in a swampy environment comparable to the modern Everglade system,"" added Prof Martin.

"Will that promising full-back relish being thrown deeper into the public spotlight?
What if the £200m superstar doesn't settle in Paris?
These are the types of questions being asked by clubs as they consider investing eye-watering sums on new players.
An emerging field of analysts and experts believe they have the answers.
But how do they find them?
Ever sent a tweet you've come to regret?
Last season, Burnley striker Andre Gray apologised and asked ""for forgiveness"" after homophobic tweets he sent in 2012 were shared.
And, just last week, Chelsea forward Kenedy was sent home from their pre-season tour of China after being accused of xenophobia and racism. He apologised for the Instagram posts.
But what can a club learn from a player's social media presence?
Ben Wright is head of sport at communications agency Cicero, which produces reports on players for clients across the globe, including seven in the Premier League and two in Spain's La Liga.
He says: ""We look all the way through a player's online presence. By doing this you can get an idea of what kind of person they are and how their character has evolved over time.
""We analyse media coverage, social media, fans' forums, everything that is available online, across 13 languages, to build up a public picture of their life.
""Are they using social media late at night? Do they blur the boundaries of public and private? How have they changed over time as they have begun to earn more money?
""Are they posting the kind of insight into their private lives that fans really appreciate, or is it all about new cars and new clothes? And are they posting this kind of stuff regardless of whether it's been a good or bad result the weekend before?""
Some clubs have developed in-house teams - sometimes within their scouting departments - to perform similar research.
But in January, Cicero produced a report on a promising young Premier League player, who will remain anonymous.
The analysis uncovered a series of social media posts, dating back several years, that were sexually explicit in nature, and found angry responses to opposition fans that included offensive language.
Ultimately, the client who commissioned the report decided not to offer the player what would have been a significant development in his career.
Case study: Andrea Belotti
Torino striker Andrea Belotti has been linked with a move to the Premier League for much of the summer.
In July, Cicero was asked to produce a report on the £90m-rated Italian, and the findings were largely positive.
One section in the report - written for a Premier League club - analyses the ""tone and approach"" of his social media activity, while another addresses the '""likelihood of future issues"".
Belotti's posts, which featured regular tributes to his wife and family, displayed ""no instances of bad language, prejudice or public disagreements"", the report said.
""It is extremely unlikely he would ever post something or engage with fans on social media in a way that brings himself or his club into disrepute,"" it added.
But, in a section titled ""social media presence"", it says there would - at this stage - be a slim chance of a club harnessing his online following to counter-balance a hefty transfer fee.
Belotti's 30,000-plus followers were, the report said, heavily Turin-based; his appeal is markedly different to the global reach of, for example, Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba.
Perhaps that outweighed his good behaviour? Belotti, 23, remains in Serie A, where he scored 23 goals last season.

Despite the benefits to be gained from monitoring it, social media can give players an outlet to project themselves as something they are not.
That becomes harder when they cross the white line on match day.
Geir Jordet, professor in sport psychology at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences, works with several top clubs across Europe - including in the UK.
""The best way to learn about about the psychology of a player is to observe what he does on the pitch,"" he says.
Jordet has devised a model of 11 attributes that can be used to judge whether a player will succeed, or can be helped to succeed, at the very highest levels.
Among the things he advises clubs to do are watch a player immediately after they make a mistake, see how they communicate with team-mates and assess to what extent the player is proactively involved in the game.
""I have built up a research portfolio on observing players' body language in matches, and I help clubs to see that,"" he says.
Jordet says clubs must also ensure any new player must fit in with the ""coaching culture"".
""The heavy training culture at one club, for example, might be a very powerful part of their recipe for success, and they might be especially keen to sign a player who fits into that - someone like Romelu Lukaku, for example.
""But there might be other clubs who would be willing to take more of a risk on a player who does not seem to be as dedicated, because they are good at dealing with so-called problem players, those who might be easily distracted by life off the pitch.""
To put it simply - everyone is different. Two individually brilliant footballers may not play well together.
Jesse de Preter, a director at Atticus Sports Management, says everyone involved in the talent-spotting process is thinking more than ever about the personality of players.
But he still regards it as an ""underdeveloped part"" of the business.
De Preter said: ""In the UK clubs it is a permanent search for talent, and many have specialists who are involved in the psychology of targets.
""The scouting departments, even at many of the Championship clubs, are full of people, full of TV screens, they have the most expensive software available, staff travelling constantly around the world. It is an extensive system, backed by a lot of money.
""Footballers are very highly paid employees, but for some reason we still think everyone should be treated in the same way. That is the same as saying: 'OK, it is physical training today, everyone runs five miles together.'
""You can see the proof every year. When a brilliant player goes for a lot of money somewhere, and does not do well, the player is blamed, the coach is blamed.
""Then, when the player goes away to another environment and becomes a star, everyone says 'oh it was too early for him', when there will be many other factors why it didn't work out, completely linked to his personality; the way he functions in a group, or the other people in a group.""
So where does this fit in with the traditional methods used by scouts?
Tor-Kristian Karlsen is now an 'independent advisor' to clubs but he used to work as a scout across Europe. He believes that the ""expertise of psychologists is a useful addition to the scouting process"".
However, he also makes the point that the traditional role of scout - if done well - has always involved ""studying players in a social context"".
This could include observing behaviour in training, a player's standing within the group dynamic in social situations, such as at a team hotel, or their reaction to the media.
He says: ""In our environment, you have seen so much of a player before you sign him - in training, in matches, interviews - and you have spoken to people that you trust, like previous coaches and other people in the football world. Usually the total of all that information is deemed to be sufficient to make a call on a player.
""If you look at a player like Kylian Mbappe, you know that he has come through the French elite national academy at Clairefontaine, then the Monaco academy, so already you know he has gone through an excellent school with really high standards. That would make you comfortable about signing him.
""Football always involves an element of risk. I don't think even the most skilled psychologist in the world could project with great accuracy where a player is going to end up. But of course it makes sense to involve such professionals, and there are clues to be found in his behaviour on the pitch, in his reputation, in his development.""
De Preter describes the increasing focus on personality as a ""new trend"".
And while former Tottenham and Liverpool director Damien Comolli says clubs have ""always checked players' backgrounds extensively"" he acknowledges the game is changing.
He says people are beginning to ""look more at the individual as a human being before as a football player"", a trend he describes as ""one of the main current topics in recruitment"".
""High-level sport is so demanding,"" he adds. ""If we get the wrong individual in on day one, that can destroy everything the club is trying to achieve.
""When I was at Tottenham we were thinking about a massive investment on a striker who was playing abroad. I travelled to meet him, and in our conversation I asked him why he would like to join Tottenham.
""His reply was: 'Well, I would like to live in London, because there I can have a quiet life with my girlfriend without everyone recognising me in the street.'
""I left that meeting feeling very uncomfortable. He never told me he wanted to win, he never told me he wanted to help the club or help himself improve.
""This is what clubs are trying to understand before they sign players, and now I think everyone is pretty much talking about the same thing: getting the right person in as well as the right player.
""It is a trend that is not going to stop evolving, and we are only at the beginning.""","Will a £300,000-a-week salary change a hot prospect's attitude to the game?"

Ms Hinks said it was ""magical"" to find the boat nine months later, while the school said it was ""over the moon"".
The boat, named the Carolina Dreamer, had been fitted with a GPS tracker and had sailed for less than a week before washing up on Bermuda.

"New by-laws will ""regulate"" camping in three zones in the park - West Loch Lomond, Trossachs (West) and Trossachs (North).
The authority said the plans only affected 3.7% of the national park and included investment in new facilities.
But the by-laws have been criticised by many outdoor recreation groups.
Those opposed to the legislation, including Ramblers Scotland and the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, said they were concerned the laws would damage access rights.
The seasonal by-laws, which come into effect next year, will be active from 1 March to 30 September.
They will cover much of the west side of Loch Lomond, the northern tip of Loch Long and many of the Trossachs lochs, including Loch Earn, Loch Venachar and Loch Lubnaig.
The national park convener Linda McKay said: ""This is tremendously positive news for all those who, like us, want to protect and enhance some of Scotland's most precious natural places.
""These carefully-considered proposals reflect the views of a wide body of interests and demonstrate the delicate balance that needs to be struck when caring for our national parks.""
As part of the plans, 300 low-cost camping places will be introduced. Some of the sites will be new or improved camping facilities and in other areas permits will be issued which will allow ""informal"" lochshore camping at ""sustainable levels"".
The national park said the by-laws were necessary to tackle anti-social behaviour. They will also make it an offence to cause damage to the natural environment and prevent long-term encampments in lay-bys.
But some outdoor groups have greeted the Scottish government announcement with ""disappointment"".
Kim Atkinson, chief executive officer of the Scottish Sports Association said: ""Our Outdoors Pursuits Group (OPG) members have always acknowledged that there are significant problems arising from certain roadside camping activities which take place along loch shores within the national park.
""However, our OPG remains unconvinced that by-laws are the solution, and remains concerned that they will undermine Scotland's much-prized access legislation.""
Jess Dolan, director of Ramblers Scotland, said the new by-laws would penalise the ""vast majority"" who camped responsibly.
She said: ""This is a sad day for everyone who holds Scottish access rights dear. The national park itself has admitted that most of the anti-social problems arising from some camping activities are caused by a lack of infrastructure and enforcement of existing legislation.
""Therefore we are disappointed that the minister has decided to approve by-laws, albeit with a short delay before they come into effect.""
Ms Dolan added that Ramblers Scotland would be working to ensure the legislation was not renewed when it comes up for review in three years' time.
And Dave Gibson, chief executive officer for the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, argued the national park and police already had the powers they needed to tackle lochside problems.
""We believe that an outcome of the by-laws will be that they will criminalise those who would otherwise wish to exercise their rights to wild camp responsibly under the terms of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003,"" he said.
""As such, this decision goes against the rights to responsible access provided in the act.""
However, the national park's plan has seen widespread support from residents of the park.
Richard Graham, chairman of St Fillans Community Council, said: ""This is great news, not only for the communities who have had to put up with environmental degradation and anti-social behaviour for years, but also for the visitors who have been put off spending time in these 'no go' zones.
""We've seen the restorative effect that dealing with the similar issues had on East Loch Lomond and look forward to seeing families, responsible campers and visitors return to areas like ours, which have been blighted by these problems for too long.""
The new by-laws are rooted in a ""Five Lochs"" study, which originally looked at problems around Loch Venachar, Loch Lubnaig, Loch Earn, Loch Achray and Loch Voil.
The study followed an alcohol ban and restricted camping along parts of east Loch Lomond, introduced in 2011. The park said the by-laws had resulted in more families visiting the area and a reduction in anti-social behaviour.
The measures in place on east Loch Lomond will now see a ""slight adjustment"" to make them consistent with the new legislation.",Plans to restrict camping around several lochs in the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park have been approved by the Scottish government.

But there was to be no fightback this time. Early in the second half, Pastore released Di Maria who slid the ball underneath goalkeeper Justo Villar.
Argentina made it four as Messi led a counter attack and set up Pastore, whose shot fell to Di Maria to finish into an open goal.

"He is refusing to stand for the The Star-Spangled Banner in protest against the plight of black people in the US.
On Sunday Kaepernick, 28, threw his first touchdown pass in 364 days in the 49ers' 45-16 loss to the Bills.
""To be honest, I was focused on football,"" Kaepernick said.
""I really wasn't listening to what was going on in the stand,"" he added.
Some fans also chanted ""U-S-A"" before the national anthem at Buffalo's New Era Field, while t-shirts featuring the player's face and a rifle target were reportedly on sale close to the ground.
Kaepernick added: ""I had some Bills fans come up before the game and say they support me.""
The quarterback said he has received death threats as he continues his protest, which stems from racial tensions that increased across the nation this year amid a string of police killings and subsequent revenge attacks.
His protest has drawn strong reactions both in opposition and support, with some fans calling it disrespectful to the US flag.
But some veterans and military members have tweeted their support for Kaepernick with the hashtag #VeteransForKaepernick.
""At the end of the day, I'm going to continue to fight for what I'm fighting for,"" he said. ""I think the message carries weight because people realise what's happening - it's something that needs to be addressed.""

"Although the speech lasted little more than an hour, it was substantial in its scope.
Channelling former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, George Osborne said ""there will be no turning back"".
But in some key respects, it was Labour's clothes he stole.
Picking up the mantle of 'One Nation' - appropriated but then arguably discarded by former Labour leader Ed Miliband - the centre point of Mr Osborne's speech was to take a key opposition policy, then enhance it.
So there would not just be incentives for employers to pay a Living Wage, it would become compulsory for them to do so. ""Britain deserves a pay rise"", said the chancellor.
Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith almost burst a blood vessel as he cheered enthusiastically, delighted that Mr Osborne had now apparently symbolised his message that it pays to work.
And Mr Osborne expropriated even more policies from his opponents, such as abolishing ""non-dom"" status for wealthy residents who had lived here for 15 of the past 20 years.
All of this was designed to bolster his narrative that the Conservatives would help working people rather than just the wealthy.
So he made his tax priorities clear.
No cut yet in the 45p rate of tax which is paid on earnings above Â£150,000. With a ComRes poll for the Daily Mail suggesting 57% of Conservative voters would oppose this, it wasn't a difficult decision to reach.
Those high earners will see their pension tax relief cut too, and tax avoiders will also be targeted. More low income wage earners will be taken out of tax all together, too.
But in other areas he pushed ahead with measures designed to highlight divisions with the leaderless Labour Party - including a cut in corporation tax to 18% by 2020, while imposing further pay restraint on public sector employees.
The chancellor knows that three of the four candidates who hope to lead the opposition have talked a lot about ""aspiration"", following criticism - especially from 'Blairites' - that Ed Miliband was obsessed with those at the top of society, whom he wanted to tax, and those at the bottom - while forgetting all about ""the squeezed middle"".
So Mr Osborne helped some of those higher up the income scale - but who might be, especially in the south, struggling with high mortgage payments and may not be feeling desperately well off - by raising the threshold at which the 40p rate of tax is levied and taking 130,000 people out of that tax band entirely.
And there would be more help with child care costs pretty much across the board, he said.
More controversially, Mr Osborne kept the promise he made in opposition to take family homes worth up to Â£1m out of inheritance tax. Its a measure which polls suggest divides opinion largely along party lines, with Conservatives supporting it and Labour voters opposed.
But on welfare reform in particular, Ms Harman argued that the chancellor's actions did not match his rhetoric on helping working families.
While Mr Osborne eased the impact of his substantial cuts in welfare often by aiming them only at future recipients, it is clear that lower incomes families who have a third child from 2017 will get less help from the state than they would now.
And would the prospect of future benefit cuts dissuade some people from coming off welfare to take temporary work now if that would expose them to a less generous system in a couple of years time?
As Downing Street in particular is keen to demonstrate that the gains of a ""lower tax, lower welfare society"" can be carried out without too much pain, the chancellor acknowledged that the full Â£12bn of savings in the welfare budget will not be fully realised until the last year of the parliament.
Some senior Conservatives are privately worried that the cuts will be spread over a number of years -  and wanted him deliver a short, sharp shock early on in the parliament.
With one poll today suggesting nearly six out of 10 voters - and more than four out of 10 Conservatives - oppose the scale of welfare reform, it is unsurprising that the prime minister is willing to compromise on the timescale if not the scope.
Before the reductions are fully realised, the chancellor will want to point to higher rates of employment and he also knows higher productivity should lead to higher pay.
So he announced higher allowances for investment, and a new fund to build more roads in England - as well as a levy to boost apprenticeships and improve workforce skills.
That was the good news. Some of the bad news is yet to come.
With his announcement that Britain would meet its Nato commitment to spend 2% of national income on defence, in effect the Ministry of Defence becomes a ""protected department"" - just like health and international development. So he is likely to announce deeper-than-expected cuts in other areas in his autumn statement in November.
Amid some relatively rosy forecasts, in the short term economic growth has been revised downwards.
So the chancellor admitted it would take slightly longer to achieve a budget surplus than he anticipated at the time of the election.
Nonetheless, the transformation of the Greek drama in to a crisis has given him plenty of cover for arguing that it in principle there should be a surplus in the ""good times"".
And where he led, a shell-shocked Labour frontbench followed - though Harriet Harman said she would look at the detail of turning this aim into a legally-binding commitment.
Labour's interim leader also accused Mr Osborne of being more interested in politics than economics.
But it was always his intention - during Labour's leadership hiatus - to make the political weather, so he probably took her criticism as a compliment.","It was the first fully-fledged Conservative Budget for nearly two decades, and one that was as deeply political as it was fiscal."
"The Tower of Refuge will be lit up in recognition of Rotary International's Thanks For Life campaign.

"The damning report found a ""worrying loss of confidence and competence"" within the federation and a ""serious loss of influence"" outside.
It said the way the federation, which represents officers, had opposed police reforms and launched personal attacks were ""strategic failures"".
The review was set up after criticism in the wake of the ""plebgate"" affair.
Meanwhile the federation's chairman has apologised to the former cabinet minister, Andrew Mitchell, for the actions of an officer who has admitted lying over his involvement in the saga.
The federation, which represents about 127,000 officers at the rank chief inspector and below, set up the review under former Home Office permanent secretary Sir David Normington last year.
Its report said the federation had faced a ""perfect storm"" of challenges for its members, including job losses, pay being ""held down"", increased pension costs and changes to working conditions, as well as major policing reforms.
By Dominic CascianiHome affairs correspondent, BBC News
But there was an ""almost universal perception"" among members that it had been a ""weak voice"" during the changes, tending to ""oppose rather than engage"" and putting forward ideas ""too late to be influential"".
The report also found the federation had reserve funds of Â£64.5m - about Â£35m held by local branch boards, which it said operated ""almost as separate businesses"".
A survey carried out for the review found 91% of federation members wanted it to change.
It also found:
Sir David said there was an ""urgent need"" for the federation to ""regain the trust of its members"" and its ""culture of secrecy"" over money had to change.
The review panel made 36 recommendations. These included:
The ""plebgate"" row began in September 2012 when Andrew Mitchell, then Tory chief whip, was accused of calling officers ""plebs"" after they refused to let him cycle through Downing Street's main gates.
Three weeks later, Mr Mitchell met three Police Federation officers who afterwards claimed he had not elaborated on the row. But a secret recording of the meeting made by Mr Mitchell showed he had in fact denied using the word ""pleb"".
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is now investigating the three officers amid accusations they lied about what was said. But the federation has called the probe ""unlawful"" and responded by announcing legal action against the IPCC.
The federation's chairman, Steve Williams, has apologised to Mr Mitchell for the actions of PC Keith Wallis, who falsely claimed to have witnessed the row in Downing Street.
PC Wallis sent an email to his local MP John Randall, the then Conservative deputy chief whip, wrongly saying that he had seen the altercation.
He has pleaded guilty to a charge of misconduct in public office, and offered to resign.
Mr Mitchell said he was ""grateful"" to Mr Williams for his apology, and would ""welcome the opportunity to meet with him for a constructive discussion in the very near future"".
On the report by Sir David Normington, Mr Mitchell said he believed the conclusions were ""right"".
The report said the case highlighted the ""extent to which some representatives feel they can pursue local action and campaigns regardless of the impact on the wider federation and the views of their colleagues"".
It said allegations some federation representatives had personally targeted successive home secretaries Andrew Mitchell and Tom Winsor - who reviewed police pay and conditions - brought the federation into disrepute and put the police reputation for ""impartiality and integrity"" at risk.
The report did highlight some positives.
All police constables, sergeants, inspectors and chief inspectors in England and Wales are represented by the Police Federation.
Its role is to help members and promote their ""interests and welfare"".
It relays officers' views to government and other decision-makers and can negotiate on their behalf.
Members of the federation also get free legal advice on issues ranging from misconduct allegations to personal injury claims.
It recognised the value of good local representatives, particularly in individual disciplinary cases and added some branch level representatives were ""taking the initiative in reducing costs of representation"".
Police Federation chairman Steve Williams said the report was ""uncomfortable reading"" but agreed ""deep cultural change"" was needed.
""The federation needs to embrace this challenge, however difficult that may be.""
If it did not, others would ""do it to us"", he warned.","The Police Federation of England and Wales should be changed from ""top to bottom"", an independent panel has said."
"Last night, Rotherham MP John Healey met government business minister Anna Soubry to ask the government for a further £4.5m to match the cash.
It will be used to help retrain some workers and also to support those jobs affected in the local supply chain.
In July, Tata Steel announced 720 job losses, most of which will go in Rotherham.
In October it announced a further 1,200 job losses in Scunthorpe.
Ms Soubry, Conservative minister for Small Business, Industry and Enterprise, said she could see no reason why the government could not match the funding if a strong bid was made by Sheffield City Region local enterprise partnership (LEP).
Mr Healey said Sheffield City Region expected the government to match local resources as has happened elsewhere in the country, such as a £9m deal for Scunthorpe.
He said: ""It's down to us in South Yorkshire to pull our finger out and get the plans together to put to government.
""South Yorkshire MPs must then lean on the government to say, 'do your bit'.""
A Sheffield City Region LEP task force will shape the overall plan.
Councillor Chris Read, Rotherham Council leader and member of Sheffield City Region, said: ""Workers in Rotherham facing redundancy will want to know we are doing everything to support them and help them back to work.
""I am determined that we will do all that we can. Companies in the supply chain will feel the impact too, and we will also be working to support these businesses, and their employees, as a key part of this plan.""
Ms Soubry said she had already asked officials to see if £1.5m for training and skills could be made available more quickly.",Sheffield City Region has announced £4.5m to help hundreds of steelworkers facing redundancy in South Yorkshire.
"Among the gripes is that bin collections are getting less frequent and cause a smelly pile-up. So what options do parents have?
Nappy bins are not always free - or available - across the UK.
Dorset, for example, recently introduced a £13 charge for an annual supply of nappy sacks, which are available for children up to age three.
Councils in Bournemouth and Poole let households of five people or more buy an extra bin for £43.
Kalpana Fitzpatrick, a journalist from London, thinks the charges are ""absolutely ridiculous"". She tweeted: ""Why not introduce a tax for dog owners where councils have to have poop bins instead of introducing a nappy tax?""
About eight million nappies are thrown away every day in the UK, according to local authorities, with one baby using enough disposable nappies to fill 40 black sacks a year.
Mother-of-three Wendy Richards, who uses reusable cloth nappies, says a nappy bin charge is ""understandable"".
""The average baby goes through a huge amount of nappies,"" she says. ""People don't realise how much landfill waste that is. Someone's got to pay for it.""
Young parents have complained of a ""poo problem"" as the time between bin collections has increased, with some areas in the UK having to wait a whole month.
Abi Jones, a PA from Essex who blogs about being mother to two-year-old Alfie, says her family has ""definitely found it more difficult"" since their local council switched to fortnightly bin collections.
""Had Alfie been a newborn - and getting through the amount of disposals newborns do - we would have had to make extra trips to the local refuse centre,"" she says.
Anglesey council, which has three-weekly collections, offers parents an extra nappy bin collection. But once a toddler reaches age three the service stops, as by this age the council says most children are potty trained.
In Bridgend, the council introduced purple collection bags for nappies and other items, such as incontinence pads, in June after it said smaller households could throw away up to two rubbish bags a fortnight.
Councils say the move from weekly rubbish collections saves money and encourages people to recycle more. Local authorities have a target to recycle at least half of all waste by 2020, to meet the European Union's Waste Framework Directive.
Councils often make exceptions for large families, disabled children and for people with medical conditions if they need more space for waste.
But Carly Dashwood, responding to the charges on Facebook, said they were ""disgusting"" if parents with disabled children had to pay.
She writes: ""I have a disabled child and he is in nappies. This is very unfair on people that don't have a choice in the matter.""
It is not compulsory to use nappy bins or sacks, but councils can fine families if their household waste gets out of control.
If a bin is so full it is deemed littering, councils can issue fixed penalty notices of about £60 to £80 - or slightly less for early payment - under the Environmental Protection Act.
If the offence is classed as fly-tipping, fines are between £150 and £400.
Rubbish collectors might to refuse to empty a bin if it is overflowing.
The number of fines issued for littering - which can include overflowing bins - was more than 140,000 in England and Wales in 2015 to 2016, according to a freedom of information request by civil liberties group, the Manifesto Club.
Reusable nappies are typically made from a cloth, such as bamboo, and a fleecy liner, and go in the washing machine.
Abi, who also uses both types of nappies for Alfie, thinks reusing is cheaper overall but can ""seem like a lot of work"".
""There is extra washing involved - about three loads a week - but this isn't much in the grand scheme of things,"" she says.
""You don't have to use them every day,"" she adds. ""If we're going out I use disposables, as they don't take up as much space.""
But the upfront cost - about £200 for a kit of 20 - can be off-putting.
Wendy says she always wanted to use cloth nappies as ""money was tight"" when she became a full-time mother.
She says: ""I did think - 'oh my goodness, what if I don't use them?' but £300 has lasted me three children.""
Prices of reusable nappies vary from about £7 to £30 per nappy.
According to consumer group Which? a basic set of reusable nappies - £80 - is still cheaper than buying a cheap brand of disposable nappies, at £38 for the first few months.
Some councils give away vouchers for reusable nappies, or free trial kits so parents can try different brands - but the giveaways depend on where you live.
""My council in Hampshire did nothing,"" says Wendy. ""It is frustrating"".
The Real Nappy campaign has a search tool for parents to find out if they can get free nappies from the council.","Parents have raised a stink over ""ridiculous"" plans by some councils in England and Wales to charge them to take away nappies on top of their household waste."

"The Regatta Quay development, which includes a 20-storey building known locally as the 'wine rack', was taken over by administrators in 2010.
The Irish government owns the site after buying Irish bank debts.
The administrators said completing the ??100m buildings was dependent on the property market.
Work on Regatta Quay started in 2007, but it stopped as City Living Developments (Ipswich) Ltd, which had borrowed from the Anglo Irish and Allied Irish banks, went into administration.
Ben Gummer, Conservative MP for Ipswich, said it was ""almost a metaphor"" for the British economy.
""It's property speculation gone mad and a banking system which is bust, so it's going to take a lot of time to put that right,"" he said.

"Professional hunter Lee Lightsey said the 15 ft (4.5m) beast was one of the biggest he had come across in 18 years and required a tractor to move it.
Mr Lightsey and hunting guide Blake Godwin discovered the alligator in cattle ponds while supervising a guided hunt on Saturday.
When the creature surfaced about 20ft (6m) away from them, they shot it.
""Although this animal is huge I was not that surprised it existed,"" Mr Lightsey said. ""We have come across lots over the last 20 years that have been only a little smaller.
""But what really drew our attention to this animal was the fact that it seems to have been feasting on the cattle on my farm, because mutilated body parts were found in the water. It was a monster which needed to be removed.""
Mr Lightsey's company arranges hunts for alligators, wild boar and turkey on the farm he owns for hunting trips. The largest alligator previously killed was just over 13ft (4m) long.
He charges $10,000 (£7,060; €8,780) to kill an alligator larger than 13ft (4m) and $4,500 (£3,180; €3,955) to kill an alligator between 10ft and 12ft. The animals are mostly killed with a high-powered rifle.
""But always we kill them with the minimum of suffering without allowing them to be injured before they die,"" he said.
There are hundreds of alligators for hunters between 10ft and 13ft, he says, while animals longer than 13ft are only encountered about once a year.

In 2012 he was knocked out in the first round by Chris Arreola, before lasting nine rounds with WBC champion Deontay Wilder. In his most recent fight, in April, Molina caused an upset by beating Tomasz Adamek in Poland.
And the Texan believes he will shock British fans with a knockout victory, just as his mentor Oliver McCall did to Lennox Lewis in London in 1994.
""I have a lot of respect for Anthony Joshua, he's bringing a lot of excitement to the heavyweight division,"" said Molina.
""But we've yet to see him in a lot of situations. There's more to heavyweight boxing than just beating down the guy in front of you.
""There are other avenues. We're going to try to put him in some spots and surprise him.
""He thinks it's going to be an easy night, the whole world thinks it's going to be an easy night, so my most powerful weapon is the element of surprise.""

"The rules were tightened earlier this year in the face of soaring property prices, especially in Sydney.
Treasurer Joe Hockey said the government now was investigating 195 residential real estate purchases by overseas investors.
He warned other investors they should report themselves if necessary.
""Foreign investors who think they may have broken the rules should come to us before we come to them,"" he said.
Foreigners must receive approval before buying established homes but can invest in new housing developments.
Under the new rules, application fees apply for residential purchases by foreigners while tougher criminal penalties apply for people who break the rules.
Mr Hockey said on Tuesday that foreigners who come forward ahead of a 30 November amnesty deadline will be forced to sell their properties but will not be prosecuted.
Of the 195 cases being investigated so far, 24 were foreign investors who had voluntarily come forward, he said.
""Another 40 cases relate to referrals from the community where members of the public suspect foreign investors may have broken the rules by using complex structures and illegal leasing arrangements to hide foreign ownership.
""We want Australia to have more housing stock and foreign investment does help in that regard but not in regard to existing housing,"" he said at a press conference.
However, the treasurer watered down concern that Sydney is facing a housing bubble that could soon burst, noting that demand for housing still outpaced supply.
""We are a long way from excess supply,"" he said.
Properties under investigation range from those in Australia's multi-million-dollar prestige property markets to more modest suburban real estate.
Last week, Fairfax Media reported that a Chinese property developer had concealed his identity behind an elderly Melbourne couple to buy one of the country's most famous homes, Altona, at Sydney's Point Piper for A$52m ($40m; Â£26m).
The Australian Taxation Office received A$37.2m over four years in new funding in last month's federal budget to handle the investigation and its data matching program has already identified one foreign investor who appears to be linked to over 10 properties ranging from a A$300,000 unit to a house worth A$1.4m, according to the government.
Authorities are also talking to a UK investor who voluntarily came forward regarding a property purchased for about A$700,000 in Western Australia.
A shortage of new houses, generous tax breaks, cheap credit and ""hot"" money from overseas have seen Sydney house price increases eclipse those of other Australian cities.
Sydney house values have risen by nearly 60% since 2009, according to property research group, RP Data. Other research shows the median price tag for a detached house in Australia's biggest city is now 13 times the average wage.
More broadly, Australia has the third highest house price-to-income ratio in the world, according to the IMF. Only Belgium and Canada are more expensive.
Despite a complex mix of factors driving prices higher, recently, Chinese investors have been singled out for criticism, with Chinese buyers seeming to dominate auction sales in some parts of the Sydney.","Australians have reported about 40 foreigners who appear to have breached residential real estate investment laws, says the government."
"A bottle of Deanston 12-year-old malt was broken over the bow of the 90-metre Offshore Patrol Vessel in a ceremony at BAE Systems' Scotstoun yard.
The ship is expected to go into service next year and will be used for counter-terrorism, anti-smuggling and defence.
The MoD said work on HMS Forth and her sister ships was sustaining 800 Scottish jobs.
The vessels will be equipped with a 30mm cannon, a flight deck capable of accommodating a Merlin helicopter, and will be manned by a crew of 58 sailors.
It is the first of a fleet of new Batch 2 River-class OPVs being built on the Clyde, which are all expected to be in service by 2021.
Their construction has filled a gap in the order books of the Govan yard, where work is due to begin on eight Type 26 frigates this summer.
The Type 26 frigate, which is principally designed for anti-submarine warfare, will partially replace the current Type 23 frigate.
Each ship will carry a crew of 118, have a top speed of more than 26 knots and a range of 7,000 nautical miles. The first vessel is due to enter service in the early 2020s.
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said that the work would safeguard hundreds of skilled jobs until 2035.
HMS Forth, the fifth Royal Navy vessel to bear the name over the past two centuries, is affiliated with the city of Stirling.
The MoD said the name maintained a connection that began when the people of the city adopted a previous ship with the name Forth during World War Two.
Minister for Defence Procurement, Harriett Baldwin, said the programme to build the ship was a vitally important part of the government's 10-year, Â£178bn plan to supply the Armed Forces.
She added: ""From counter-narcotics operations in the Caribbean, to securing the UK's borders on patrols closer to home, the Royal Navy's new Offshore Patrol Vessels will help protect our interests around the world.""",The first of a fleet of five warships being built on the Clyde has been formally named HMS Forth.

""Playing in Basel is always a highlight of the year,"" he said.
He has won Swiss Indoors seven times since making his debut in the tournament in 1998.

Federer's first appearance in his home tournament was in 1998, where as a 17-year-old he was beaten in straight sets by Andre Agassi.
There is, of course, no guarantee Federer will be on the Order of Play in 2019, but this is another reminder of his long-term thinking.
He missed the last six months of 2016, not just to allow his knee to recover, but also with preservation of his body in mind. At one stage, the conversation revolved around whether Federer would make it to the Rio Olympics. It is time to start the debate about Tokyo.

""Obviously for the 50m you have to be strong, you have to be big and you have to be good in the water.""
Proud, who won two Commonwealth gold medals at Glasgow in 2014, broke Foster's 14-year-old short-course 50m freestyle British record by clocking 20.74 secs in December.
He also improved his own long-course record in the same event with a time of 21.73 at the British Universities and Colleges Championships in Sheffield on Saturday, where he won two golds.
""I think Mark Foster definitely set the trend that you don't have to do a huge amount (of training) in the water, especially for a sprint event which lasts 21 seconds,"" added Proud.
""At the same time I'm still focusing on the 100m, which means I have to spend a lot more time in the water - so I'm mixing them both up a bit.

"The prime minister said these people were not benefiting from treatment and were increasing the risk of passing the virus on to others.
The Health Protection Agency said about 600 people were dying needlessly from the condition each year.
Its figures have been released to coincide with World Aids Day.
Mr Cameron said the event should be used to ""spread the message"" about education, testing and early diagnosis.
""World Aids Day is a chance to do two things - take action and reflect,"" he said.
""First and foremost, it's got to be a spur to take action, as there are still far too many people who aren't educated about HIV and Aids and who don't get tested.
HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus and on its own it does not kill you.
The virus can survive and grow only by infecting, and destroying, the immune system.
This continual assault on the immune system makes it weaker and weaker until it is no longer able to fight off infections.
Without treatment, it takes about 10 years from infection to the development of Aids - acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
It is then that ""opportunistic infections"", ones a healthy immune system could fight off, become deadly.
People can die from pneumonias, brain infections, diarrhoeal illnesses, as well as certain tumours such as lymphoma and cervical cancer.
BBC Health: HIV and Aids
""People need to know that, diagnosed early, the outlook for most people with HIV in the UK today is a good one, thanks to the availability of effective treatment and the excellent care provided by the NHS.
""Above all, people need to know that it's never been quicker or simpler to get tested.""
The Health Protection Agency (HPA) said its figures suggested about 100,000 people in the UK were currently living with HIV, but about a quarter of them did not know they had the virus, which untreated can lead to the development of Aids.
The figures also showed that more than 6,000 people in the UK were diagnosed with HIV last year.
Among men, the figure of more than 3,000 diagnoses was an all-time high.
Lisa Power, from the Terrence Higgins Trust charity, said fear was stopping some people getting tested, but they were much better off knowing if they had HIV.
She said: ""It's extremely alarming that so many people in the UK have HIV but are undiagnosed.
""Nowadays, if you get tested, get diagnosed and get on the treatment at the right time, you can live to a ripe old age. You'll live into your 70s, maybe even your 80s.
""But, if you don't know that you have it... then you could become very ill before you're diagnosed and then the pills won't work as well.""
She said a shortage of money available to the trust meant it had to target the most at-risk groups, adding: ""What's happened over the last decade or so, there has been very little awareness of HIV and sexual health among the general population.""
To mark World Aids Day, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement on global progress on cutting new infections and Aids-related deaths.
In 2011, there were 2.5 million new infections - down 700,000 from the 2001 figure - and an estimated 1.7 million people died from Aids-related illnesses. That was 600,000 fewer than in 2005.
The WHO said improving access to antiretroviral drugs was key to cutting rates further.","There is still too much ignorance about HIV and Aids, David Cameron has said, as figures suggest 25,000 people in the UK have the virus but do not know."

"The 72-year-old from Ramsgate, Kent, is one of seven people to have been charged with the importation offence, which has been deemed a ""relatively new phenomenon"" by the National Crime Agency.
But what is the scale of the problem?
More than 100 child sex dolls have been seized in the UK as part of a special operation set up by the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Border Force.
Investigators believe the dolls, which are made to be as life-like as possible, are being imported by people who have a ""sexual interest"" in children.
Advertised as ""adult dolls"" on sites including EBay and Amazon, they are manufactured in the Far East and sent to Britain via courier, fast parcel and other delivery services.
Each doll costs around Â£800, is made of a silicon-like material and weighs as much as a child.
The NCA, which set up Operation Shiraz, says paediatricians have assessed the dolls seized to be ""anatomically correct"".
Since March 2016, 123 dolls have been seized, destined for 120 importers.
Seven people have been charged with importation offences, two of whom, Andrew Dobson and Dean Hall, have been convicted and sentenced.
Dobson, 49 and from Crewe, was jailed for two years and eight months. He also admitted possessing indecent images of children.
Hall, 42, from Bury St Edmunds, was given a two-year suspended term. He was in also in possession of indecent images.
Hazel Stewart, operations manager for the NCA, said: ""The individuals who import this type of article - child sex dolls - have a sexual interest in children and these items are an indication of that.""
She said when people have been questioned by police about the dolls some have claimed they were bought for a ""joke"", others say they for ""companionship"".
""If it was a Marks and Spencer mannequin I wouldn't be stood here,"" she said.
Each doll is typically packed in a brown cardboard box.  It is unclothed and the head is detached from the body with the feet and hands packaged to avoid damage.
It sometimes arrives with a ""pretty pink blanket"".
It is not a criminal offence to possess a child doll of this kind; the only offence which people can be charged with is importation of an obscene or indecent article.
There is no legislation to stop people manufacturing them.
""Whether they're indecent or obscene is a matter of big debate,"" said Ms Stewart, acknowledging that some will argue allowing people to have such dolls may stop them abusing real children.

"Almost 1.7m euro (£1.3m) has been paid out by the Erne Trust since 2012.
The money was for legal bills and other fees incurred by the Quinn family.
The receiver for the assets of various Quinn family members took legal action to have the trust's donors disclosed to him.
He suspects it is a ""sham trust"", which is a conduit for assets which have been concealed from him.
Declan Taite was appointed receiver in 2012 at the request of IBRC, formerly known as Anglo-Irish Bank.
He told the court that it is his job to identify, locate and collect assets.
He added that the Quinn's have ""openly admitted"" they put property assets beyond the reach of IBRC and that those assets have ""generated tens of millions of euros"".
He said he is trying to ""understand the provenance"" of the money in the trust to determine that it does not originate with the Quinn family.
A list of donors including names, addresses and sums donated has now been given to Mr Taite.
His barrister said the close family connections includes siblings, however, a barrister for the trust said he was ""not aware"" of a sibling connection.
The trust's barrister added that it was ""not surprising"" that Mr Quinn's business acquaintances should support him.
Mr Taite's barrister said that having received the list of names there may now be a need to gather further affidavit evidence.
The case was adjourned until September.","The donors who have effectively been paying Seán Quinn's legal bills include business acquaintances and ""close family connections"", the High Court has been told."
"Mr Gunnlaugsson, his wife and other Icelandic ministers were named in the Panama Papers. He had said no rules had been broken but was accused of concealing millions of dollars worth of family assets.
Icelandic readers have been sharing their views on the current political situation and how the protest may have played a part.
""I am shocked at how he chose to resign. He should have done that a long time ago. He didn't speak to his governmental department beforehand. The way he did it was entirely unacceptable.
""My gut feeling is that there is something very rotten in Iceland.
""Monday's protests were definitely something that Iceland has never seen before and the current situation is entirely unprecedented in Icelandic politics.
""I was inside looking out of the window and was startled by the egg thrown at the window, but the protest was 99% peaceful.
""I heard there could have been 22,000 at the protests. That would be 6% of the whole population - one of the largest protests we have had.
""It was a good atmosphere. I have never seen Iceland react in this way before.
""People are hurt and disappointed by Gunnlaugsson - it is not what they voted for.
""Even people who are loyal to the government are baffled - they have no words.
""One of the reasons why the government got a big following was that they said they'll take a strong hold of the economy.
""But the normal Icelander lost everything - their jobs, their homes, their future.""
""I'm not surprised he has resigned. It was obvious this would happen eventually. I'm happy about it.
""He did the right thing but it should have been sooner. I hope they call for snap elections now. We won't stop protesting until we get that.
""The protests definitely put more pressure on Gunnlaugsson and everyone else in the coalition.
""It showed that we as a nation were not going to back down.
""There is definitely excitement and changes in the air here in Iceland.""
""The prime minister, the finance minister, and the interior minister have all been named in the Panama Papers.
""I feel a mixture of anger, shame and betrayal - it's the same feeling I had during the financial crisis.
""Recently, Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson and the finance minister talked about the Icelandic Kronur being stable.
""But they keep their money elsewhere like they don't trust the system with their own money.
""In Iceland our welfare system is horrible - they are trying to privatise the hospitals and healthcare system because there's no money in the budget.
""If everyone paid their taxes we would have a good welfare system.
""The taxes go up on food but don't raise them for rich people.
""There's almost a divide in our country.""
""Like half the nation, I've been watching TV live. It's been disrupting my work!
""Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson suggested his vice-chairman of the party would take over as PM. In my opinion that's not a good move.
""His resignation is like a scapegoat to allow the government to survive.
""It's obvious that the protests on Monday influenced this in one way or another.
""It's clear as day that this government has fallen and that we'll see a new election soon. It is purely based on the enormous reaction from the citizens of Iceland in the wake of the Panama television expose and his disregard to the public's reaction.
""On Monday you could not see a spot of grass at Austurvollur where the protests took place.  It was hard to wade through the crowds.
""Different kinds of people were there from the far left to the far right, from the old and the young - I was there with my children.
""The prime minister declined interviews with national TV for the last two weeks but he made an appearance elsewhere and said he hadn't thought of resigning, and that people wouldn't go out to protest in their numbers.
""Monday's protest was a blunt message to him. I was already planning to go to the protest but after Sunday's broadcast, I got really angry.
""I was flabbergasted after hearing about the Panama Papers, but it didn't surprise me. Both the prime minister and finance minister are businessmen so we could have guessed.

"Titanic Quarter Ltd has now taken on fresh borrowing of up to Â£75m from Danske Bank.
The Davidson Kempner fund took control of the loans in 2014 as part of a deal with Ulster Bank.
It came at a time when Ulster Bank was working to drastically reduce its property loan book.
Most of those loans were sold to US funds which are generally not intending to build long term relationships with borrowers.
James Eyre, the commercial director of Titanic Quarter, said the refinancing deal with Danske was an important step.
""We are delighted to be back working with a local bank and to have significant additional financial support from the shareholders which reinforces their commitment and confidence in Titanic Quarter,"" he said.

"The woman, 39, suffered ""multiple serious injuries"" after plummeting to the ground during a ""routine"" jump over Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, on 5 April.
Police said it was miraculous she had survived, after her main chute failed and a reserve only partially opened.
A 35-year-old man was arrested but has since been bailed, police said.
Wiltshire Police began an investigation after being alerted by the parachute club at Netheravon Airfield to concerns over what had happened.
Detectives said they were particularly looking for ""slinks"" or soft links, used to connect the canopy to the parachute harness, which were ""missing"".
Det Insp Paul Franklin, said the woman, an experienced parachutist, had ""very nearly lost her life"".

"Over the course of 43 years, WG (if you don't already know, the initials stand for William Gilbert) scored 54,211 first-class runs, including 124 centuries, and took 2,809 wickets and 876 catches.
Friday marks the centenary of the death of the man they call 'the father of the game', the original 'beard that was feared'.
WG Grace was born in Downend, near Bristol in 1848 and to many that play the game, he is known as ""the greatest"". Former England and Gloucestershire wicketkeeper Jack Russell is one who is well aware of the impact of Grace both locally and internationally.

""I don't think you realise until you delve into it what a big superstar he was,"" Russell told BBC Inside Out West.
""In cricketing terms he was massive. Everything he achieved in those early days in the game set the platform for the history of the game. If you spoke to a lot of people outside of cricket who don't know a great deal about the sport, I'd be surprised if they hadn't at least heard of WG.""
Grace is widely credited with transforming cricket with his performances for both Gloucestershire and England and his legacy lives on at Nevil Road - 100 years after his death.
""I remember playing as a youngster at the County Ground and we used to sleep in sleeping bags in the changing room,"" added Russell.
""There was this room that was always locked but we knew it was full of old dusty memorabilia and in the middle of the night you could sometimes here footsteps and creaking floorboards. Our coach Graham Wiltshire used to say if you lot mess about, WG will come down and get you. I didn't see him but I heard him.""
Grace made his Test debut against Australia at The Oval in September 1880, scoring 152, and two years later was in the side which lost at the same ground, marking the birth of the Ashes.
He made his highest Test score of 170 in 1886, again at The Oval, but in 1892 became the first England captain to surrender the Ashes urn when they were beaten 2-1.
In 1895, at the age of 47, he scored 1,000 runs before the end of May, completed his 100th century and eventually totalled 2,336 runs that summer.
His score of 318 not out against Yorkshire in 1876 stood as a Gloucestershire record for 128 years until it was beaten by Craig Spearman (341) in 2004.
Piers Morgan, former editor of the Daily Mirror and lifelong cricket enthusiast, once nominated WG Grace as the greatest English player of all time.
""Boxing gave us Muhammad Ali, football you would have Pele, and in cricket Grace was the greatest. Botham rolled into Flintoff rolled into John Bull,"" Morgan told BBC Radio 4's Great Lives in 2006.
""He had everything. He was physically imposing, he was comfortably the best player of his generation, if not all time.

""He was there when cricket became not just a village green pastime but became a proper international sport and it needed an iconic figure to make that transition work and to bring the English public with him and Grace did that magnificently.""
Former BBC Test Match Special commentator and 'voice of cricket', the late John Arlott, was another to have no doubt about Grace's stature within the game.
""Look back through the swirl of two World Wars to any one of 1,000 English cricket fields and see there a tall man with a ringed red and yellow MCC cap perched on his head,"" he said.
""A huge black beard falling down across his barrelled chest and a cricket bat looking like a toy in his hand and there is the Gloucestershire man of pure country strain who without a moment of unfaithfulness to himself became known to millions because he was not only the greatest cricketer of his age, but also one of the greatest men of his age.""

Grace had another career - as a doctor in the 1880s and 1890s.
""As far as he is concerned, sport is about winning,"" Richard Tomlinson, author of Amazing Grace, told the BBC.
""It's the only thing that matters, that's what makes him so thrilling to watch.
""He was the first sporting superstar. He was the only superstar for quite some time because he was titanically better than anyone else. He scored 50 first-class centuries by the age of 27. You've got to add up all the centuries scored by the next 13 most prolific batsman in the same period to reach Grace's tally.
""There is this extraordinary double life he leads when he is a doctor in Bristol and he is also the most famous sportsman if not most famous celebrity in the British Empire, which basically means the world.""
Dr WG Grace died at the age of 67 on 23 October 1915 at his home in Kent, having suffered a cerebral haemorrhage, but his legacy as the greatest of them all lives on.
Listen again to Jonathan Agnew's ""Remembering WG Grace"" programme, which is available as a podcast.","For a man who played his cricket in an era of poor pitches and limited time for practice, WG Grace was nothing less than a phenomenon."
"The fact that Europe's most-wanted man was able to evade capture for three days, crossing several borders to get from Germany to Italy, has raised questions about security.
The missing piece in the puzzle hangs over where Amri headed immediately after the attack.
Dutch police are investigating whether the Netherlands was Amri's first stop, before he went on to Paris and then Italy.
Their suspicions are centred around a Sim card found in Amri's backpack issued between 20 and 22 December in one of three possible Dutch cities - Breda, Zwolle and Nijmegen, Italian media reported.
Police believe he was spotted on CCTV in Nijmegen station and was probably handed the Sim card there.
In the aftermath of the attack German police searched a refugee centre in Emmerich, just across the border at Nijmegen.
Train tickets found on Amri after he died show he travelled through France.
The first was for a journey from the city of Lyon to Chambery, in the French Alps, on Thursday afternoon.
CCTV footage has been released of him at Lyon-Part-Dieu station, before he apparently boarded a train to leave the city.
Another train ticket, for later that day, was from Chambery for Milan, with some reports that he stopped in Turin on the way.
Police have produced a picture of Amri at Milan central station, three hours before was shot dead.
The fugitive is said to have arrived at in Milan at 01:00 on 23 December. From the main station, he made his way to the suburb of Sesto San Giovanni.
Investigators are trying to find out if the gunman was in contact with anyone in Italy, and what his next destination was should he have evaded capture.
He had around â‚¬150 (Â£128) in cash, according to reports, and no food or extra clothing in his backpack. One theory is that he was aiming to take a bus to the Balkans or southern Italy.
But by the time he arrived in Milan, it was clear the authorities had lost his trail.
It was only a routine police stop that led to his death: he drew a gun, wounding an officer before being shot dead by another.
While inquiries continue, foremost on many people's minds is the question of apparent security failures.
Germany issued a European arrest warrant for Amri on 21 December. Pictures of the suspect, along with his various aliases, were widely publicised.
France - which boosted security following attacks in 2015 - further reinforced checks at key transport hubs.
Opposition politicians including centre-right presidential candidate Francois Fillon and Marine Le Pen, leader of the far-right Eurosceptic National Front, were quick to criticise what they said was the failure of the authorities to stop Amri from entering the country.","Anis Amri, the jihadist who rammed a lorry into a crowd at a Berlin market on 19 December, died days later in an exchange of fire with Italian police in Milan."

""I am keen to hear from anyone who was in the area around 21:00 on Sunday night and who might have information that can assist us with our inquiries.

The victory margin was a surprise - many analysts had predicted a tighter race after four opposition parties united behind Mr Lowassa's candidature.
It boiled down to Mr Magufuli's popularity, which superseded that of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) that has dominated politics since independence from British rule in 1961.
So what are the five big challenges he faces once in office?
Change was the buzzword during the election campaign. Now people will expect him to engage in a major house-cleaning exercise by showing the door to corrupt government officials and old-school public servants.
This will pose a huge political risk, as they are well-entrenched in CCM. But Mr Magufuli, the former works minister, will have to tackle corruption head-on, as Tanzanians have had enough of it.
His first big test will come with the appointment of a cabinet.
Will it be made up of people untainted by corruption? If not, voters will be disappointed.
After all, he has built his political career on the promise that he is not scared of taking risks, and that he works hard and acts fast.
Although the official unemployment rate is at around 10%, people sometimes get the impression that the crisis bigger - a recent advert for 70 jobs in the public service posts attracted more than 10,000 applications. Interviews had to be held in a football stadium.
Almost half of Tanzania's 50 million-strong population is made up of young people, and they are worst-affected by unemployment.
They voted with great enthusiasm, believing their fortunes will change under Mr Magufuli.
He will be under most pressure from them to deliver on his promise to create jobs - and end poverty.
He has promised to revive industries which are in bad shape, like the cotton and fish processing sectors.
Mr Magufuli has promised children free education from kindergarten to secondary school.
While many Tanzanians welcome this, they feel it is not enough. They want a higher standard of education with improved curriculums so that Tanzania can have a better-skilled work force.
Mr Magufuli will be hard-pressed to meet their demands - almost all state schools are short of desks, books and teachers.
With last week's local elections in Zanzibar scrapped because of alleged rigging, Mr Magufuli will have to make sure that a re-run takes place, and that it is free and fair.
When Mr Kikwete came to power, he promised to keep a close eye on the semi-autonomous islands, which are popular with tourists.
But as he leaves the office, more than 60% of Zanzibaris want more autonomy for the archipelago - an indication of their dissatisfaction with the union.
If Mr Magufuli can bring about a lasting solution, he will go down in history as one of Tanzania's most successful presidents - but it is a big if.
Outgoing President Jakaya Kikwete promised a new constitution, but failed to deliver on it during his 10 years in office.
The opposition gained many votes with its promise to make sweeping changes to the constitution - including reducing presidential powers and guaranteeing the impartiality of state institutions, like the electoral commission.
Mr Magufuli ignored the issue during the election campaign. Can he afford to do that throughout his presidency? Unlikely.",Tanzania's President-elect John Magufuli will be inaugurated on Thursday following his landslide victory in fiercely contested elections.
"Mr Osborne said the changes would allow councils to allocate more sites for building homes specifically for people who already live or work in the area.
He said he also wanted to improve transport, schools and broadband in rural areas to boost the rural economy.
But Labour said the plans were ignoring the need for more affordable homes.
The chancellor wants to extend the government's ""starter homes"" scheme, announced before the election for brownfield sites, to some villages.
The initiative offers young local first-time home buyers a 20% discount on the price of the property. As it stands, the discount will be offered on homes up to Â£250,000 outside London and Â£450,000 inside London.
The measures are part of Mr Osborne's new rural productivity plan, which will be unveiled later.
Steve Reed, Labour's shadow local government minister, said the Conservatives' housing policies had made things worse for people in rural communities.
""The government says it wants to build starter homes in rural areas but it seems these will replace affordable homes to buy and rent - starter homes should be additional to affordable housing supply not instead of it,"" he said.
""In many rural areas buying or renting a home has become increasingly unaffordable. Yet the government has undermined the provision of affordable housing at every step by watering down requirements on developers to build new affordable homes.""
Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Osborne said rural areas were an increasingly dynamic part of the economy, with 60,000 people moving from the city to the countryside each year.
He has pledged to continue to protect the Green Belt but said he wanted to ""make it easier for people to stay in their rural communities and for newcomers to settle there too"".
He and Environment Secretary Liz Truss write in their joint newspaper editorial: ""For rural areas, we want better internet and mobile phone communications, better transport, better schools, better skills, better housing, better business growth and better local government.
""And we'll look at planning and regulatory constraints facing rural businesses. In a recent survey of rural businesses the main barrier to growth that most identified was planning restrictions.
""So for a start, we'll review rules around agricultural buildings such as barns to allow rural businesses to expand more easily.""
The Campaign for Rural England said it welcomed the government's recognition that rural areas could boost the economy, but it voiced concern that the ""beautiful English countryside"" was at risk of ""inappropriate developments"".
Planning officer John Rowley said: ""We recognise that providing the right houses in the right places that meet local need is a vital part of ensuring our villages remain vibrant and sustainable.
""However, the proposals risk alienating local communities and reducing the amount of affordable housing in rural areas. The government's suggestion that young families will be able to afford houses at even 20% discount will not ring true in many low-waged rural economies.""
He added it was likely that commuters would be able to outbid local families, taking advantage of the discount which would not continue on resale - and therefore there would be no incentive for local people to back any new developments.",Chancellor George Osborne has said he wants to reform planning laws to make it easier for villages in England to build new starter homes.
"The businessman headed to Clacton-on-Sea after he admitted he knew ""nothing"" about the Essex town.
But following his visit, he said he would be backing local party councillor Jeff Bray.

The multimillionaire businessman said: ""I have no intention of standing in the way of hard-working activists who are the soul of the party.
""Therefore, after visiting Clacton, I believe it would be wrong of me to stand against Jeff in the forthcoming hustings.""

""If there are any investigations we will fully take part, but it is difficult to comment further.""
Newton Aycliffe, of Northern Football League Division One - the ninth tier of English football - have previously been the subject of a Durham Football Association investigation after Spennymoor Town refused to play the second half of a pre-season friendly in July after the match took an ""aggressive direction"".
Oliver said Dixon's departure was related only to Saturday's incident.
Morpeth's joint-chairman Gary Munday said the club, who play in the same league as Newton Aycliffe, are in the process of submitting a full statement to the Football Association as the incident is understood to have also been witnessed by the match referee.
While the club have not made a complaint to police, they said that if any player was to report an assault they will fully support any investigation.
Video footage of the clash at Newton Aycliffe's Moore Lane Park ground against their north east rivals shows a number of players from the home side running towards and gathering at the visitors' dressing room door.
Morpeth staff and coaches are said to have kept Newton Aycliffe players back, with at least one member of the home club's staff also trying to keep players out.
Oliver and another staff member are also understood to have walked Morpeth players back to their cars after the match.
Munday said he ""had never witnessed anything like it at a football match"" and ""applauded Newton Aycliffe's strong stance"" in dealing with the matter internally.
However, he fears it could have an effect on the club's support.
""We are shocked and disgusted by what happened,"" he said.
""Morpeth Town is a very family-orientated football club as we encourage our juniors, free of charge to support the club - that grass-root support is the future of football.
""Unfortunately, we have had parents say that they will never take their children to away games again.
""We will try to encourage them back as we do feel that this is a one-off.""
The BBC have contacted the FA for comment, but are yet to get a response.",Newton Aycliffe sacked their manager Peter Dixon after players from the non-league club fought their way into their opponents' dressing room.
"Sir Bob Kerslake said one of the difficulties was that ""easier"" savings had already been made.
He said the ""sense of urgency"" would be reduced and the need for cuts would be hard to explain to public sector staff.
Sir Bob stepped down from his role this month and was replaced by former Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood.
He said the civil service had ""excelled"" during his time in charge.
Speaking at the Institute for Government think tank, he said it was clear that ""under any government, we face up to a further five years of austerity in public sector spending"".
""The first five years have been challenging but the second five years are likely to prove even harder for three reasons,"" he said.
""Firstly, the easier savings have already been made.
""Secondly, we are likely to be doing it against a background of a growing economy and greater competition for good staff.
""Thirdly, the sense of urgency that underpinned the first savings programme will be reduced.
""In reality, the task is not yet complete. But this will be hard to explain to those in the public sector, including our own staff, who are looking for some relief.""
Sir Bob said the civil service had ""excelled"" in its challenge to ""deliver big programme savings at the same time as undergoing huge change and reduction itself"".
The roles of cabinet secretary and head of the civil service were split into two jobs when Sir Gus O'Donnell retired as both in 2012.
Sir Bob, who was already permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), took the role as head of the civil service at that time.
He will retire from his DCLG role early next year.","The outgoing head of the civil service has predicted another five years of UK government spending cuts - and he said making the cuts would be ""even harder""."
"Richard Ratcliffe's wife, Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, was arrested in April while visiting family with their two-year-old daughter and is accused of seeking to ""overthrow the regime"".
Mr Ratcliffe has asked David Cameron to help, and says the Foreign Office is doing more ""as this gets more serious"".
His daughter is with family in Iran.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 37, of north London, works for the London-based Thomson Reuters Foundation charity.
She travelled to Iran on an Iranian passport with daughter Gabriella and was arrested at Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport on 3 April and taken to Kerman in the south-east of the country.
Her family had expected her to be released last week, but a statement from the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps now claims she heads a ""foreign-linked hostile network"".
Mr Ratcliffe, who has been trying to get a visa to visit his wife, told BBC Radio 4 she had spent 45 days in solitary confinement and this had made her ""very weak"".
""When she came out she wasn't able to walk without blackouts and she had a problem with her hair falling out and she'd lost quite a lot of weight,"" he said.
Her condition improved during a spell living alongside other inmates and she was then told she would be released, Mr Ratcliffe said.
Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe left Kerman prison on 5 June but, instead of being released, her parents were told she was being moved to a different prison.
Mr Ratcliffe said the family then heard ""nothing from her for a number of days"", adding: ""Last week we celebrated Gabriella's birthday and we had no idea where she was.""
On Monday Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe called her parents to say she was in a prison in Tehran - and Mr Ratcliffe believes that may help her.
""Now she's in Tehran then, if nothing else, the Iranian authorities can look more seriously at what's going on and look at these crazy theories coming out from the provincial office,"" he said.
He said the reasons for the accusations against his wife were ""not at all clear"", but he believed they came from the Kerman branch of Iran's Revolutionary Guard - and in part they might be ""justifying that they've held her for 70 days"".
He said the accusations were not detailed but they suggested his wife was ""in charge of this great network of media organisations and espionage agencies and that she and Gabriella are there running the whole thing"".
He added: ""It feels this is wrapped up in Iranian politics and different factions fighting and holding her as some sort of bargaining chip.""
The Foreign Office said it was urgently seeking information on Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's situation.","The husband of a British-Iranian woman in jail in Iran says he hopes ""senior intervention"" from UK and Iranian authorities will lead to her release."

"One of their clubs will be consigned to automatic relegation after Saturday's final Scottish Premiership fixtures, with Accies presently ahead by a point.
Manager Canning said ""it means everything to everybody"" at his club.
But he said: ""Richie's saying what I would expect him to say, but the pressure is still on Inverness.""
Caley Thistle's 2-0 win over Dundee on Wednesday - their second victory in three games - has resurrected their hopes of avoiding automatic relegation as they prepare to host Motherwell.
Accies have, meanwhile, lost four games in a row and presently occupy 11th spot, which comes with it a play-off against the winners of Friday's semi-final between Championship clubs Falkirk and Dundee United for a top flight berth.
""I said a long while ago it would probably come to the last game,"" said Canning, whose side entertain Dundee. ""But I didn't think it would be only ourselves and Inverness involved in it.
""He (Foran) is trying to take all the pressure off his team and on to our team, which is a natural thing to do.
""But, trust me, there's still a load of pressure on Inverness because they have still got to win their game and if we win our game and take care of our job then it doesn't matter what they do.
""For the first time, they've got an opportunity to catch us, but they have got to go and win their game still.""
The frustration for Canning is missed opportunities in recent matches, including Tuesday's 3-2 defeat away to Ross County which the hosts won courtesy of Jonathan Franks' stoppage-time goal.
""The Ross County game was the worst I've ever been involved in in terms of getting a feeling that every break is going against you,"" said the Accies boss.
""We played really well and had a lot of opportunities and didn't get one break. Hopefully they come on Saturday.
""The last couple of games have been tough on us.
""If we can replicate that performance from the other night then hopefully that's enough to get the three points.""
Canning retains belief in his players' ability to avoid relegation.
""It has been in our hands and we have lost four games in a row, which isn't acceptable at this stage of the season, and that's going to put you in trouble,"" he added.
""For us, yes, there is pressure, but it is no more so than it was on Saturday and on Tuesday.
""We need to make sure we go and win and, if we get three points, it doesn't matter what Inverness do.""",Martin Canning has dismissed as mind games Inverness counterpart Richie Foran's suggestion that the relegation pressure is on Hamilton Academical.
"The RMT union is balloting more than 1,000 members who work at stations.
GTR, which includes Southern and Great Northern, plans to close 34 station ticket offices and staff 49 others only at peak times.
The two sides are in a long-running dispute over the role of conductors.
Stations listed for reduced ticket office hours include Chichester, Crawley, Dorking, Huntingdon, Hove, Lewes, Reigate, Stevenage, Welwyn Garden City and Worthing.
Ticket window closures include Alexandra Palace, Caterham, Cricklewood, Lancing, Purley and Sutton.
GTR said new ""station hosts"" would work on the concourse instead to assist passengers and help sell tickets.
The RMT claimed 130 station jobs were at risk and said the cuts would also have a ""devastating"" impact on safety and services offered to passengers.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""These plans fly in the face of the response from the thousands of passengers who objected to the closure of ticket offices and the de-staffing of stations as Govia drives on with plans for a ""faceless railway"" where the public are left to fend for themselves on rammed-out, dangerous and unreliable services.""
But GTR director Keith Jipps said: ""The RMT's threat of further industrial action is entirely unwarranted and clearly another bid by the union to disrupt passengers and GTR across as many parts of our franchise as possible.""
""Our new station hosts will be paid more, be able to work in safety and provide passengers with better customer service, but the RMT is not concerned with improving the experience for passengers and are dismissing significant improvements to the terms and conditions for staff,"" he added.
The union is to ballot staff in the first two weeks of August on ""strike action and action short of a strike.""

"He said he would require ministers and civil servants to record all meetings with newspaper and media proprietors, senior editors and executives.
Labour leader Ed Miliband said he hoped it would be ""retrospective"" back to the 2010 election.
He again attacked Mr Cameron about his decision to hire Andy Coulson at No 10.
The issue came up at a fiery Prime Minister's Questions ahead of a statement in which Mr Cameron gave more details of a proposed inquiry into phone hacking.
MPs were due to debate calls for News Corporation to withdraw its bid to fully take over BSkyB - but the company withdrew it shortly beforehand saying it was ""too difficult to progress in this climate"".
It follows allegations that the phones of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the families of the Soham murder victims and of British soldiers killed in action, had been hacked.
Former PMs Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have both faced Freedom of Information requests over their meetings with News Corporation boss Rupert Murdoch and Mr Cameron has also faced headlines about his ""secret meetings"" with Mr Murdoch.
At PMQs on Wednesday, he said what had happened at News International - News Corporation's UK arm - was ""disgraceful"" and the company should ""stop thinking about mergers when they've got to sort out the mess they have created"".
But he added: ""If we are going to say to the police 'you must be more transparent and cut out corruption', if we are going to say to the media 'you must be more transparent and cut out this malpractice' then, yes, the relationship between politicians and the media must change and we must be more transparent too about meetings.""
He said politicians had been ""too silent"" about media tactics in the past: ""That is part of the problem. Your bins are gone through by some media organisation but you hold back from dealing with it because you want good relations with the media.
""What we need is some honesty about this issue on cross-party basis so we can take on this problem.""
The prime minister's official spokesman said Mirror Group reporters had gone through Mr Cameron's bins when he was in opposition.
In his statement to MPs later, he said he would consult Cabinet Secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell about amending the ministerial code ""to require ministers to record all meetings with newspaper and other media proprietors, senior editors and executives - regardless of the nature of the meeting"".
Top civil servants and special advisers would also have to record such meetings - and the information would be published quarterly.
Mr Miliband said he welcomed the proposal but added: ""I hope and expect he will ensure that that proposal is implemented in a retrospective way back to the last general election.""
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said it appeared the change would not mean every meeting with every journalist would have to be recorded - but he said it would allow people to see whether there was a pattern of politicians meeting particular proprietors or newspapers in advance of important decisions.
Mr Miliband also renewed his attack on Mr Cameron for hiring former News of the World editor Andy Coulson as his communications director at No 10. Mr Coulson resigned earlier this year but had denied knowing anything about phone hacking while he was in charge of the newspaper.
There have been reports that the Guardian informed Mr Cameron's aide Steve Hilton over links Mr Coulson reportedly had with private investigator Jonathan Rees - and that Mr Hilton passed on the information to Mr Cameron's chief of staff Ed Llewellyn.
Mr Cameron said: ""This information was not passed on to me.""
But he added it was not secret information as it had been largely published in the Guardian at the same time, in February 2010, and had ""no allegations directly linking Andy Coulson to illegal behaviour"".
And the PM said he met Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger the following month - but he had not raised the issue with him.
Mr Miliband said the prime minister should apologise for his ""catastrophic error in judgement"" in appointing Mr Coulson as his director of communications.
Mr Cameron told MPs he had hired Mr Coulson on the basis of assurances that he did not know about the phone hacking and was not involved in criminality - and he should be ""innocent until proven guilty"".
But he added: ""If it turns out he lied, it won't just be that he shouldn't have been in government, it will be that he should be prosecuted.""
The Labour leader said Mr Cameron ""just doesn't get it"".
But Mr Cameron said he could raise the issue of Mr Miliband's own communications director Tom Baldwin, another former News International journalist, and Gordon Brown's former aide Damian McBride - who resigned over unfounded personal smears made about senior Tories.
Mr Cameron also said News International should have accepted the resignation of its chief executive Rebekah Brooks - who was editor of the News of the World when murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler's mobile phone was allegedly hacked into. The Labour leader has called for her to quit.","David Cameron has said the relationship between politicians and the media ""must change"" and pledged to be more open about meetings with media bosses."
"Dr Emyr Roberts said the EU's impact had been ""largely positive"" but there was the ""potential to do even better"".
In a wide-ranging BBC Wales interview, he also defended his leadership of the environmental watchdog, which has faced a slew of difficult headlines.
He is set to retire in October after almost five years.
When it comes to environmental law, the EU has amassed more of it than anywhere else in the world.
In many cases NRW's staff are responsible for monitoring whether Wales is meeting European standards.
Those duties will change after Brexit as Welsh or British standards are developed, with potentially more responsibilities placed on the regulator, Dr Roberts predicted.
He said the EU's strict environmental regulations had led to ""significant improvements"", highlighting bathing water quality and reductions in industrial emissions.
""First of all it's very important that we do keep the current standards after Brexit - they have been successful,"" said Dr Roberts.
""But going forward there is the potential to do even better - and in particular if we can bring together agricultural policy and environmental policy.
""I think we can bring Welsh solutions to the table where in the past we've been quite restricted.""
He also said he thought the public in general ""undervalue the environment and the benefits it can bring"".
Dr Roberts has been chief executive of NRW since its formation in 2013 when three former quangos - the Environment Agency, Countryside Council for Wales and Forestry Commission Wales - were merged.
It is the largest government-sponsored body in Wales, employing 1,900 staff across the country.
The aim was to manage the environment in a more joined-up way while keeping a distance from the Welsh Government.
However a year in, wildlife presenter and naturalist Iolo Williams s branded it a ""disaster for conservation"", with NRW's independence called into question over support for a motor racing track near Ebbw Vale.
It became evident that merging different organisations was proving to be a huge challenge. Leaked staff surveys came under the spotlight and claims of morale problems were made.
Most recently a row over a Â£39m timber deal that was not put out to tender prompted criticism from the Auditor General for Wales and an investigation by the assembly's public accounts committee.
The timber industry complained of ""an extremely worrying loss of forestry expertise"" within the organisation, while fishing and river groups also attacked NRW, branding it ""no longer fit for purpose"".
In May Dr Roberts announced he would retire, saying it was time to ""pass the reins onto someone else"".
Asked about the regular criticism, Dr Roberts said he felt it reflected the passion people felt towards the Welsh environment.
""The one thing I have learnt in this job is that you can't please everybody anytime,"" he said.
""But many of those comments come from a particular angle - whether it's fishing or conservation.  Our job is to join all that up and make the best solutions.
""Sometimes you have to make compromises.  We have to take things in the round, base it on evidence and come to the right decision for the environment and the wider society as well.""
However Dr Roberts acknowledged that the damage done to NRW's reputation by the constant criticism had taken its toll on staff morale.
He said the 2016 staff survey, which showed fewer than half of employees felt valued and only 11% had faith in senior managers to make the right call, had been ""very, very useful"".
""We had a very clear picture of what staff wanted - they wanted to be more involved in the decisions being taken around them, they wanted to be communicated with better, they wanted to be valued more,"" he said.
""And since then we've been working very hard to build that up - so we're starting to turn that around.""
In what could be construed as a warning to Welsh Government ministers, Dr Roberts suggested the services NRW provide could suffer if it is asked to make further savings.
Its budget has been cut by 15% in real terms over the past four years.
During the same period, NRW has been issued with further statutory duties as a result of new laws such as the Environment Act.
""I think we've been able to manage the situation well, but I think there comes a point where you can't cut any further without impacting on those services.""
Diane McCrea, NRW chairwoman, has thanked Dr Roberts for his ""huge commitment and hard work in leading Natural Resources Wales"".
Environment Secretary Lesley Griffiths added: ""Bringing together three organisations and creating an effective regulator and delivery body has been no mean feat.""","Brexit presents an opportunity to improve the way Wales' environment is looked after, according to the outgoing head of Natural Resources Wales."
"The surrogate says they deliberately left Gammy behind, but took his healthy twin sister. The couple deny this.
It later emerged that the man had previously been convicted for child sex offences.
Officials say they have now managed to reach the couple, but have no major concerns at present.
The contact follows days of speculation over the couple's whereabouts.
In a separate discovery, nine babies were found in a Bangkok flat, with a lawyer claiming they were all surrogate babies fathered by a Japanese businessman.
Child protection officers reached the Australian pair after trying for the past few days.
Western Australia Child Protection Minister Helen Morton told Fairfax Radio on Thursday: ""We've had telephone contact with the family and we're in the process of putting other arrangements in place.""
The department had no ""major"" concerns at present, but would consider how to ensure the safety of the baby girl, Gammy's sister, she said.
She urged the media to give the family ""privacy and confidentiality"" in the meantime, adding that at this stage there was no evidence of anything illegal about the surrogacy arrangements.
According to court documents, the man was convicted in the 1990s for the sexual assault of several young girls.
However, his adult son, who did not wish to be named, told local media that the man was a ""good father"" who had changed.
""He's just got a massive heart. He's made mistakes, we've accepted it... he's made up for them,"" he said.
The case of baby Gammy has made international headlines and caused uproar in Australia.
Besides Down's syndrome, the six-month-old has a congenital heart condition and a lung infection.
Surrogate mother Pattharamon Chanbua, who has been looking after Gammy, said the couple had asked her to have an abortion when she was told of the child's condition four months after becoming pregnant.
She said she refused, as it was against her Buddhist beliefs. Abortion on the grounds of foetal impairment is illegal in Thailand.
Ms Chanbua, 21, has said the father met the twins, but only took care of the girl.
The parents have told local media in Australia that they did not know of his existence, and claimed that the allegations made by Ms Chanbua are lies.
Meanwhile, Thai authorities say they have found six boys and three girls, all aged two or younger, in a condominium in Bangkok.
The children were accompanied by several nannies and a pregnant woman.
A Thai lawyer told police he was representing a Japanese man, who was father to all the surrogate babies, telling the Bangkok Post that the surrogacy arrangements were all legal.
Deputy national police chief Aek Angsananont told Reuters news agency: ""We are questioning the nannies, as well as asking for co-operation from the Japanese embassy, to help conduct DNA testing.
""If the Japanese man admits that all the children are his babies, we would ask him why he wanted to have so many babies.""
Commercial surrogacy is not illegal in Thailand, although the authorities are now seeking to tighten regulations.
Thailand is a popular destination for surrogacy arrangements, along with the US, India, and Russia.
Thailand's medical governing body has recently said that its rules prohibit same-sex couples or single people from engaging a surrogate mother, fees should not be paid, and the surrogate mother must be a blood relative of the intended parents.",Australia's child protection services have contacted a couple accused of abandoning a baby with Down's syndrome to his surrogate mother in Thailand.

"McGuigan was previously owner but sold his shares to Lemos in September.
Since then, there have been financial issues including wages being paid late and the club are also operating under a transfer embargo.
Co-chairman Ali Abdulrahman Al Hashemi and director Nigel Adams have left because of the current situation.
In an interview with BBC Radio Lancashire, McGuigan also revealed that:
""The board are aware of it all now and are absolutely staggered about what has happened,"" said McGuigan.
""That is a private matter we can't go public on - what we can go public on is he hasn't put a penny into the club.
""There is no hope, in my opinion, of any money coming in and we've got to manage it ourselves.""

"Resuming on 43-1 after there was no play in the first session, debutant Eddie Byrom (43) and Adam Hose (48) put on 77 to take the score to 102-1.
But Holland then dismissed Byrom, James Hildreth, Tom Abell and Steven Davies in a remarkable four-over spell of 4-8.
He ran out Lewis Gregory before Gareth Berg (3-26) claimed two wickets, then rain forced an early close at 135-8.
Somerset came into the day in a commanding position, having triggered a similar collapse from Hampshire with the pink ball under the floodlights in their first innings.
However, the poor middle-order batting that has undermined their County Championship season came back to haunt them, meaning a first win of the season is now very unlikely.
Opener Byrom, who had looked otherwise solid, chipped USA-born Australian Holland to mid-on and Hildreth went lbw for two before Abell and Davies feathered edges to Lewis McManus, both without scoring.
Gregory was run out by Holland when he slipped trying to run a quick single, leaving Berg to pin Hose lbw and have Craig Overton caught at mid-wicket before rain prevented any play in the final session.
Ian Holland told BBC Radio Solent:
""It was a strange session of cricket. Obviously they had the momentum early and they got a decent partnership but we got a load of wickets in a hurry, so it's a decent end for us.
""It puts us in a strong position. You never know. There are still 96 overs, maybe more, left in the game.
""It is nice to contribute and come in and do well. I don't want to come in and be deadweight. The pink ball has been good to me. It seems to do bits in periods of the game and then flatten out. You are never out of the game.""
Somerset director of cricket Matt Maynard told BBC Radio Bristol:
""It was so good to see Adam Hose and Eddie Byrom batting well and getting into a good position, then Holland came on and nipped it around under the lights and caused problems.
""It was nibbling a little bit more. When you come in under those conditions it is tricky. He had a couple of decent balls out there. None of our boys gave their wicket away.
""Eddie Byrom has impressed full stop. I liked the look of him in the academy and he is now getting his game. He knows his strengths in this form of the game and he showed that with the balls he left. I feel chuffed for the lad.""","Ian Holland took 4-16 as Somerset collapsed, losing seven wickets for 33 runs against Hampshire on day three."
"Arseny Yatsenyuk said the government was sending a bill to MPs urging that Ukraine's non-bloc status be cancelled.
The remarks come as Nato holds an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis in eastern Ukraine.
The West has stepped up its accusations of direct Russian involvement in the conflict, following advances by pro-Russian rebels.
On Thursday Nato released satellite images it said showed Russian forces inside Ukraine. and said more than 1,000 troops were operating there.
Russia denies sending troops.
Nearly 2,600 people have been killed since April, the UN says, when Russia's annexation of Crimea prompted the rebels to take control of large parts of Donetsk and Luhansk regions in the far east of the country.
""The government is entering a bill to Verkhovna Rada [parliament] about the cancellation of Ukraine's non-bloc status and resumption of Ukraine's course for Nato membership,"" Mr Yatsenyuk said.
Ukraine's previous President Viktor Yanukovich, ousted earlier this year, enshrined the country's non-aligned status in the constitution in 2008.
At a government meeting, Mr Yatsenyuk said Ukraine's main aim remained membership of the European Union.
He said the bill that was being presented would also prevent Ukraine from joining any bloc that would stand in the way of this, meaning any economic union involving Russia.
Heavy fighting is continuing near Ukraine's strategic port of Mariupol, on the Azov Sea. Rebel forces are trying to capture the city but Ukrainian government troops are digging in.
On Thursday the separatists seized the nearby town of Novoazovsk.
The advance has raised fears that the Kremlin might seek to create a land corridor between Russia and Crimea - a territory annexed by Russia from Ukraine in March.
Rebels are also reported to have surrounded government soldiers in several places further north, near the city of Donetsk.
Ukrainian forces near the town of Ilovaysk say they are cut off and have been urgently asking for supplies and reinforcements.
Overnight, Russian President Vladimir Putin called on the rebels to open a ""humanitarian corridor"" to allow encircled Ukrainian troops to leave without unnecessary casualties, though he did not specify the location.
Rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko later told Russian TV that his fighters had agreed to the request, on condition that the Ukrainians hand over heavy weapons and ammunition.
Ukraine security officials said in a statement that the proposal demonstrated that the rebels ""are led and controlled directly from the Kremlin"".
At least 2,593 people had been killed in the conflict between mid-April and 27 August, the UN said in its latest report.
Human rights violations like abduction and torture were ""committed primarily by the armed groups"", referring to the rebels, it said.
Separately, Human Rights Watch said in a report that the rebels were subjecting civilians to torture, degrading treatment and forced labour.
The reports of Russian troops fighting with rebels prompted renewed Western criticism of Moscow's role in the conflict.
US President Barack Obama blamed Russia for the escalation but stopped short of saying its troops had invaded Ukraine.
""There is no doubt that this is not a home-grown, indigenous uprising in eastern Ukraine,"" he said.
""The separatists are trained by Russia, they are armed by Russia, they are funded by Russia.""
Mr Obama is due to discuss the crisis with European leaders at a Nato summit in the UK next week.
Nato released satellite images it said showed columns of Russian armed forces inside Ukrainian territory.
Nato Brigadier General Niko Tak said more than 1,000 Russian troops were operating inside Ukraine, both supporting the separatists and fighting on their side.
He told the BBC there had been a ""significant escalation in the level and sophistication of Russia's military interference in Ukraine"" over the past two weeks.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said no proof had been provided that Russia was directly involved.
""We're hearing various conjectures, not for the first time, but not once have any facts been presented to us,"" he told journalists.
At Thursday's emergency session of the UN Security Council, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin accepted that there were Russian volunteers in eastern parts of Ukraine, but accused the Ukrainian government of ""waging war against its own people"".",Ukraine's prime minister has said he will ask parliament to put the country on a path towards Nato membership.

"Ivor Miller, 27, who has learning difficulties, was chased by the group after one member called him ""a beast"".
The 27-year-old sought refuge in a derelict flat and jumped out a second floor window suffering severe injury.
At the High Court in Glasgow, judge Norman Ritchie QC ordered a 17-year-old man to be detained for six months.
The judge told the eight accused: ""This whole incident, some of which was captured on CCTV, is extremely disturbing.
""The group, like a pack of animals, turned on an entirely innocent young man for no good reason other than he behaved differently because he has learning difficulties.""
Three of those who pursued Mr Miller were originally charged with attempted murder.
Michael Clare, 21, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, and two 17-year-old youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had their guilty pleas to charges of assault accepted.
All three admitted attacking Mr Miller by chasing him into the common close at 52 Howard Street, Glasgow, on 4 August last year.
All three, and another 17-year-old youth, a 16-year-old girl, a 16-year-old youth and 23-year-old David Newlands, from Maryhill, Glasgow, admitted committing a breach of the peace and placing Mr Miller in a state of fear and alarm.
Newlands also pleaded guilty to punching Mr Miller on the head in the Hootenanny pub in Howard Street.
Jade Park, 19, from Glasgow, who sparked the incident by falsely calling Mr Miller ""a beast"" admitted punching him in Jamaica Street and in the Crystal Palace pub.
Judge Ritchie sentenced a 17-year-old male to six months detention for assault.
He deferred sentence on Park, who is about to give birth, until June for good behaviour and imposed a community payback order on all the others and ordered then to perform 150 hours unpaid work in the community.","Eight people who chased a vulnerable man until he threw himself out of a flat window in Glasgow have been called a ""a pack of animals"" by a judge."
"Surfing began somewhere in the distant past of Polynesian culture and by the mid eighteenth century, Captain James Cook sailed to Hawaii and saw locals climbing onto wooden boards and speeding along the waves.
Eventually, a craze for wave riding spread and now it's thought at least 36 million people worldwide identify themselves as surfers.
They all, however, face an inescapable truth: perfect, surfable waves don't always show up where and when they're wanted.
""Most of our good surfing waves around the world are adjacent to big expanses of ocean,"" says Dr Mark Davidson of Plymouth University, an oceanographer with a special interest in waves and surfing.
The best surfing waves start life in stormy seas far from shore. Winds whip the surface into peaks which race away from the storm centre and over time transform into swell that rolls along under its own steam.
Like fine wines, the best waves take time to mature.
These water-borne pulses of energy continue their long journey towards land, sorting themselves out as they go, becoming less choppy and more refined - and bigger.
That's why world-class surf rolls to shore in spots like Hawaii, Bali and Portugal. Elsewhere, where there isn't a wide ocean delivering well-matured swell, people are attempting to improve the waves.
The aim of artificial surfing reefs is to enhance smaller waves into a surfable break.
""There's no magic here, you don't create waves,"" says Dr Davidson. ""The idea is that you can focus waves, a bit like light travelling through a lens,"" he says.
A reef - natural or otherwise - acts as a magnet for swell, concentrating the waves' energy and making a bigger, more powerful break. That's the theory, anyway.
One of the newest artificial surfing reefs was installed on England's south coast, at Boscombe close to Bournemouth.
Here in the English Channel, where long-distance swell is distinctly lacking, waves are driven by local winds which produce choppier, smaller surf.
In a bid to improve the quality and consistency of Boscombe's waves, Bournemouth Borough Council paid Â£3.2 million to install an artificial surf reef.
The football pitch-sized reef consists of sand-filled geotextile bags that were designed to raise the seabed and magnify existing waves.
But when the reef opened in 2009, it was a crashing disappointment for local surfers.
""It didn't produce the right shape of wave,"" says Mark Davidson.
He was brought in to assess the reef's performance, which he did by surfing it with a GPS unit fitted inside his wetsuit.
""That allowed me very accurately to evaluate my ride length, the peel angle of the waves and how fast the wave was breaking,"" he says.
Dr Davidson concluded that the reef was no good for surfing.
It kicked up steep, dumpy waves that collapsed over his head rather than breaking gradually, peeling from one side to the other.
Boscombe's surf reef is not the first to fall short. According to Davidson, of the 12 artificial surf reefs built worldwide, none have worked.
""As yet we still don't have a successful example in generating a quality wave for recreational surfing,"" he says.
The flaws could come down partly to the turbulent sea shifting the sandbags until they lose their original shape.
It's also clear that scientists still haven't yet got to grips with the complex mix of ingredients that go into sculpting natural waves.
""We're still learning,"" Mark adds.
Another wave-making team has taken things a step further by removing their waves entirely from the unfathomable ocean.
I encountered some of these artificial waves in a most unlikely location - a peaceful lagoon many miles from the sea, at the foothills of the Cantabrian Mountains in northern Spain.
This is the prototype Wavegarden, the upshot of a decade's research and development and the brainchild of Josema Odriozola.
He was inspired to build the surfing equivalent of skate parks; a space for wave-riders to congregate and practise their sport.
Lying on my board in the purpose-built lagoon, it's a radically different experience to surfing at sea. There are no currents to battle or unwanted waves splashing in my face.
All I have to do is wait and a perfect wave will come my way.
Still, I'm nervous at first, unsure if I'll be able to catch the huge wave that rises up out of nowhere like a sea monster from the flat lagoon and races towards me, a wall of glassy, green water.
The secret to the Wavegarden's success lies along the midline of the oval lake, hidden beneath the surface.
Key engineering details are carefully guarded but Josema tells me the device is essentially a blade, shaped like an aeroplane wing, known as the ""wave foil"".
A winch adapted from a ski lift drags the wave foil through the water, creating a wake behind it.
Josema explains how they've honed the wave foil's shape to minimise energy consumption while making the biggest possible wave - the Wavegarden can generate 1.2m-high waves and 2-metre giants.
As for the length of the ride, there's no limit: build a longer pool and you'll get a longer wave.
All that matters is that the pool is the right shape.
""There must be a certain angle between the swell and the shore, and these conditions don't happen so often in the sea,"" says Josema. ""This is what we're recreating here, these special conditions.""
On my first ride at the Wavegarden (admittedly with some assistance from Josema) I'm amazed when I catch the wave and get to my feet.
I find myself hurtling along, trees whizzing by, and suddenly I grasp the whole point of these artificial waves: they're truly exhilarating, but they are also the fast-track to getting better at surfing.
For years I've struggled to be in the right place at just the right time to catch an awesome wave like this. After a few more goes I begin to get the hang of these artificial waves which sweep up and down the lagoon, one every minute.
Now that Josema and his team have perfected the technology, surfers will soon be riding waves in various other unexpected places.
Wavegardens are due to open to the public in the inland reaches of Dubai, the US and even wave-pounded Australia. The first opened recently in the last place you'd expect to find a decent surf break, among the craggy peaks of Snowdonia.
So, will landlubbing, artificial waves take off?
I put that question to Boscombe-based surfer, Sean Taylor.
""Every surfer will be curious about a manmade wave and everyone will want to try it,"" he says. ""But ultimately you're always going to want to come back into the ocean.""
That's clearly the case for the hardcore surfers who still flock to Boscombe whenever breakers appear - next to the pier, but not over the reef - even if the waves are few and far between.","For centuries, people have been lured in by the thundering power of surf."

Riaz described England's middle order as ""fragile"" before the first Test at Lord's starting on Thursday.
""It's the same before every series - you generally get a bit of trash talk,"" said Root, who will bat at three.
""It's getting a bit like boxing now. We will have to wait and see how things develop and see if the plans work.""
Boxing is notorious for fighters' pre-match verbal contests aimed at intimidating opponents.
James Vince, who has played only three Tests, and the recalled Gary Ballance will bat at four and five for England when the four-Test series gets under way.
Former England captain Michael Vaughan said Vince should have been promoted to three to enable Root to stay at four.
England vice-captain Root, 25, averages 50.36 in 21 innings at number four and only 28.71 in eight innings at three.
Root, 25, said it is ""a great opportunity to bat a bit longer"" and that captain Alastair Cook, coach Trevor Bayliss and the selectors gave him time ""to get my head around it"".
He added: ""It's about taking that opportunity for responsibility as a senior member of the side, to lay some good foundations for us to make some big scores.""
Nick Compton batted at three for England in the 2-0 series win over Sri Lanka, but announced he was taking a break from cricket after scoring only 51 runs in five innings.
Vince managed 54 runs batting at five against Sri Lanka, his debut Test series.
Ballance has not played for England since being dropped last July, but made 132 for Yorkshire against Middlesex this month in his most recent first-class game.
Root said Vince and Ballance had a ""great opportunity"" to prove Riaz wrong, adding: ""Gary's in fine form - he's just got a hundred for Yorkshire.
""Vincey's a brilliant player. He made his first innings for England in the one-day series against Sri Lanka - he made a brilliant fifty. So they'll take confidence.""
Pakistan pace bowler Mohammad Amir will play his first Test since serving a five-year ban and three-month prison sentence for spot-fixing at Lord's in 2010.
England captain Alastair Cook has warned the 24-year-old, who took four wickets in Pakistan's opening tour game against Somerset, to expect a ""reaction"" from the crowd this week.
But Riaz said: ""Mentally he's very strong, and he's very eager to perform.
""The place where it all began, he will perform at that place and make sure his name is reborn.""","England batsman Joe Root said cricket is becoming like boxing as he dismissed Pakistan bowler Wahab Riaz's ""trash talk""."
"It is designed to help diagnose different types and stages of ovarian cancer.
The developers, in Belgium and the UK, said many women with cancer were not getting the right treatment.
The charity Ovarian Cancer Action welcomed the test, saying early identification was ""much-needed"".
The test is designed to distinguish accurately between benign cysts and malignant tumours as well as identify how aggressive tumours are.
It was developed by University of Leuven and Imperial College London scientists to help the patient get the right surgical treatment.
""It's very important to get the pre-operative diagnosis right,"" said Prof Tom Bourne of Imperial College London.
""If it isn't right, the patient might have a more extensive operation than they need, for example having an ovary removed unnecessarily.""
Prof Bourne told the BBC that ovary removal could be ""a critical issue for young women in terms of fertility"".
The test uses a combination of patient information, blood test results and ultrasound scans to predict the malignancy, type and stage of the cancer.
The researchers used data from 3,506 patients in 10 European countries between 1999 and 2007 to develop the test.
The team, reporting their findings in the British Medical Journal, then trialled the test with a further 2,403 patients between 2009 and 2012.
Prof Bourne said their test was better than current practice in the UK.
Ovarian cancer can be difficult to diagnose early, because symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain can be put down to other common illnesses.
It is the most aggressive gynaecological cancer, with only about 40% of patients still alive five years after being diagnosed, according to the research paper.
One of the main factors in survival is how early the cancer is diagnosed. There is currently no screening available, so patients have to rely on seeing a doctor and being correctly diagnosed in time.
Another important factor in the survival rate is whether surgery is carried out by a specialist surgeon, the researchers said.
Many women were currently operated on by general surgeons, possibly because the true nature of the illness came to light only during surgery.
Cancer charity Ovarian Cancer Action said the new test could be useful.
""Anything that makes a diagnosis of ovarian cancer easier, earlier and quicker - like this tumour blood marker test - that gets women tailored treatment sooner, is very much needed,"" said chief executive Katherine Taylor.
If women were diagnosed in the early stages of ovarian cancer they had a 90% chance of surviving the next five years, but if the cancer was found at a later stage, the five-year survival rate reduced to 22%, she said.
""Awareness of this disease among women and GPs is key,"" she added. ""Ovarian cancer is the UK's most deadly gynaecological disease, with over 7,000 cases diagnosed every year.""","A new test can help doctors identify ovarian cancer more accurately and cut down on instances of unnecessary surgery, claim scientists."
"Their study of more than 7,000 people suggests exposure to bleach and other chemicals is a factor in one in six cases of adult-onset asthma among British people in their mid-50s .
The study, in Thorax, identified 18 high-risk jobs - four of which involved cleaning.
Top of the list were farmers, followed by aircraft mechanics and typesetters.
General cleaners, office cleaners, domestic helpers and care workers all featured on the list.
So too did hairdressers and laundry workers.
Experts say a person's working environment is to blame rather than their occupation per se.
Hundreds of occupational agents have been linked to asthma. This includes flour and grain as well as detergents.
Fine particles can be inhaled into the airways and cause irritation.
Lead researcher Dr Rebecca Ghosh said cleaning products were starting to be recognised as a potential cause of asthma.
She said there were specific Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) guidelines relating to cleaning products.
Employers are expected to control exposures to hazardous substances and report any cases of occupational asthma.
""Occupational asthma is widely under-recognised by employers, employees and healthcare professionals. Raising awareness that this is an almost entirely preventable disease would be a major step in reducing its incidence,"" Dr Ghosh said.
Malayka Rahman, of Asthma UK, said: ""We advise anyone who works in the industries highlighted in this study and who have experienced breathing problems to discuss this with their GP, and we urge healthcare professionals to make sure they consider possible occupational causes in adult-onset asthma and tailor their advice to people with asthma accordingly.""","People who work with cleaning products risk developing asthma, believe UK experts who have explored the link."
"The test involves four minutes of footage from its Planet Earth II series, which promise to reveal more detail and present more vibrant colours than was possible before.
It is part of efforts to develop technologies that will make live broadcasts in the new formats possible.
But only a minority of TVs can screen the footage at this stage.
""One of the clips is a frog on a leaf with lots of rain, and the reason this is so interesting is that the redness of the frog is a really deep Ferrari red that you would never get in broadcast television at the moment,"" explained Phil Layton, head of broadcast and connected systems at BBC Research & Development.
""We want to show that this is how the BBC could make ultra-high definition HDR material available to iPlayer.
""And we want to use this as a trigger to work with manufacturers to get their products updated so there's a pathway there for future on-demand BBC content.""
As the trial went live, only Panasonic's latest screens supported the test footage in 4K.
But the displays were still not able to show the HDR enhancement because they do not yet support the underlying technology - co-developed by the BBC and Japan's NHK - known as hybrid log-gamma (HLG).
Although most TV manufacturers can update their newer TVs to add support for HLG, it is unclear whether they will do so.
Holding back support would give them an opportunity to market future models as being the first to support the format closer to when it launches.
From the consumer's point-of-view, there are two key improvements.
A 4K picture - also referred to as ultra-high definition (UHD) - means that four times as many pixels are used than in 1080p HD.
This makes it possible to reveal details - such as the texture of an animal's fur or the faces of the crowd at a football match - that would have appeared more blurry otherwise.
The main caveats are that the TV needs to be suitably large and the viewers close enough to it, otherwise they will not appreciate the difference.
HDR takes advantage of the fact displays can go brighter than before to allow an image to be graded with more levels of brightness between black and white.
This is not about everything looking brighter, but rather using the greater contrast range to allow shadows to appear less murky and highlights - such as sunlight gleaming off water or stars twinkling at night - to be better defined.
In addition, HDR uses a wider colour space - meaning it is capable of showing shades of colours that could not be transmitted in traditional broadcasts, helping footage appear more lifelike.
Many people who have experienced both, say that HDR has a greater impact on picture quality than 4K.
""It gives more nuance to the picture, which if you are talking about Planet Earth is going to be amazing,"" said Stuart Miles, founder of the Pocket-lint news site.
""The best way to describe it is it's like when you add a subwoofer to a sound system.
""Until you've had it you don't realise you need it, but once you've added it you ask how you could have lived without it.""
The BBC will make the footage available via the different smart TV versions of its iPlayer app as soon as the relevant models support it.
But it will be some time before it starts offering scheduled broadcasts in 4K and HDR.
Mr Layton said the technological challenges could be resolved within the next 18 months.
But programmes will cost more to make if they take advantage of the innovations. So, the improved quality will have to be weighed against the fact the majority of viewers will be unlikely to have TVs that support the new technologies for some time to come.
In the meantime, Amazon and Netflix both offer some pre-recorded shows and movies in HDR and 4K.
And BT and Sky both offer movies and sport in 4K but not HDR.",The BBC has begun a trial of 4K high dynamic range (HDR) video on its iPlayer streaming platform.
"Lamara Bell, 25, was found conscious inside the car near Stirling on 5 July but died in hospital four days later.
Her partner John Yuill, 28, died in the crash which was reported to police but not followed up.
Ms Bell's brother Martin said police investigations revealed she was able to speak to rescuers when they found her.
In a post on Facebook, Mr Bell said: ""She was defo 100% conscious. She was able to tell them her name. She added 4 years on to her age and told them she was 29. She did also say she was only in the car for 20 mins.
He added: ""They also said she was still moving around trying to get out the car but was trapped.
""Proud of my sis for doing so well over those three days then the following days in hospital for not giving up the fight. Brave amazing girl. She gave it her all and fought until the end.""
Ms Bell, a mother of two from Falkirk, was found beside Mr Yuill in the couple's blue Renault Clio on 8 July.
The car, which had left a slip road and gone down an embankment, was reported to police on the day of the accident by a member of the public.
But the details were not entered into the police system.
It was eventually located by officers following up another call from a member of the public who had seen the vehicle.
Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson has ordered a review of all police call handling and the case is also the subject of an independent investigation by the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc).","A young mother who lay trapped in a car for three days after it crashed on the M9 was trying to escape when rescuers arrived, her brother has said."

Proposals for a new station have been shown at a public event and it is hoped it will open in 2019.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates said: ""We've been working very closely with the local authority, local interest groups and the railway industry to ensure that proposals result in the station and interchange development starting on the ground in April 2018.""",A village in Ceredigion could soon have a new railway station if the Welsh Government is successful in its funding application.
"But this wasn't any ordinary political programme. To investigate what the women of Scotland want from the independence debate - never mind the outcome - we decided to have an all-female cast of contributors.
This wasn't to alienate the good men of Scotland but to ensure we crammed the programme with as many disparate female voices as possible.
The spark for ""What Women Want"" was a poll by the influential Scottish Social Attitudes Survey that highlighted a sustained gender gap in voting intentions.
Who? Voters in Scotland will go to the polls to vote on their country's future.
What? They will be asked the yes/no question: ""Should Scotland be an independent country?""
When? The vote takes place on Thursday, 18 September, 2014.
For as long as the organisation has asked a question about independence - about 15 years - women have been less keen on voting Yes by a consistent six or seven percent margin. Combine that with the disproportionate number of women who say they are undecided, and you have a societal grouping that could prove pivotal for September's outcome.
We wanted to get to the root of why so many women felt unable to make a decision and why, among those who'd professed an opinion, so many felt independence wasn't the road to travel.
It's easy for people like me who've been interviewing politicians on the referendum debate since Adam was a boy to assume every word of it is fed into Scotland's homes to be analysed and debated, but that's clearly nonsense.
Normal people have other priorities, and it could be argued that because so many women have families or are carers, our lives tend to be more fragmented. It's not that we work any harder, let's just say we often have more plates spinning than men.
On the search for women from all walks of life a night at the bingo proved an eye-opener and a humiliation. You would imagine that hearing a number and marking a card is fairly straightforward. It's not. Trailing three numbers behind the caller was a bit disconcerting; having the elderly lady next to me take over my card while marking three of her own, was downright embarrassing.
When I wasn't interrupting their games the women at the bingo were keen to tell me how they felt they weren't being served by the Yes and No campaign. Time and time again I heard a plea for transparency in the debate and a hope that the politicians would stop shouting at each other and provide some facts.
Whether or not there are facts to be had in this most crucial of decisions is debatable in itself, but as far as the women we spoke to are concerned, at least some straight talking wouldn't go amiss.
The programme also decided to tackle head on the hypothesis that women are more risk averse and therefore prone to sticking with the status quo, i.e. the UK. Try telling the ladies of Edinburgh's Auld Reekie Roller Girls, who meet on a Friday night and knock lumps out of each other on roller skates, that they're a bunch of fearties.
The fact that the paramedics arrived and hauled one of the roller ladies off for a night in the infirmary was passed off as a regular, but mild inconvenience.
Were women simply afraid of independence and its leap into the unknown? The general consensus at the roller derby seemed to be no, but as the Roller Girls are on first name terms with the staff at the fracture clinic, perhaps they weren't an entirely representative bunch.
There was certainly more time for considered thinking at the huge wedding fair that took over much of the SECC.
Once the brides-to-be and their assorted mums and pals realised that my camera crew and I were interrupting their day to talk politics rather than place settings they were surprisingly forthcoming. I suppose you can't prepare for a life of wedded bliss and even plan a family without taking cognisance of the sort of country you want to live in.
It's clear to me, having ambushed women to carry out similar interviews six months ago, that there has been a big shift. From general apathy back then there is now a widespread hunger for information and for certainties.
As I've said, the cynic in me very much doubts either side can offer the copper-bottomed facts at least this half of the electorate so badly wants, but I hope I'm proved wrong.
Away from the civilians in this battle, the seasoned political warriors we spoke to did try to convince us of the surety of their positions, as you'd expect.
Nicola Sturgeon chatted to us in her kitchen which she revealed, with disarming honesty, she rarely visited. She also conceded that unless women could be persuaded to favour independence the referendum would not be won.
We spoke to powerful women in the unionist camp too, as well as historians, writers, professors - and even a neuroscientist. We cleaned gutters - or rather I did - we shopped for clothes and put a focus group of undecided women under the spotlight and gave them a grilling.
Overall, we tried to represent some of the diverse roles Scotswomen in the 21st century find themselves in while they ponder their country's future. And did we eventually discover what women want? Of course I'm not telling you, you'll have to watch the programme to find out.","When I started making a documentary about women and the independence referendum little did I know that Maw Broon, a night at the bingo, paramedics at the roller derby, cleaning out my gutters and learning of Nicola Sturgeon's unfamiliarity with her kitchen would all play a part."
"Victor Sorochenko, the head of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, said it was too early to conclude what caused the crash on Saturday.
He told reporters debris was found across a 20sq km-wide area of Sinai. So far 163 bodies have been found.
Russia is observing a day of mourning after its worst air disaster.
Mr Sorochenko spoke after visiting the site of the debris, near the village of Hasana.
Jihadists allied to so-called Islamic State in Sinai, where such groups are active, had made a claim on social media that they had brought down flight KGL9268.
But Egyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail said experts had confirmed that a plane could not be downed at 9,450m (31,000ft), the altitude the Airbus 321 was flying at, by weapons the militants are known to possess.
President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi also urged caution on Sunday, saying the investigation into the cause was a ""complicated matter"" that could take months.
Russian Transport Minister Maksim Sokolov said no evidence had been seen that indicated the plane was targeted, and IS has not produced pictures or video footage to substantiate its claim.
Analysis by BBC Monitoring found that a video purporting to show the downing of a plane did not appear to be an official IS clip, and was not shared on official IS channels.
Three airlines - Emirates, Air France-KLM and Lufthansa - have decided not to fly over the Sinai Peninsula until more information is available. Two smaller carriers, flydubai and Air Arabia, also said they would re-route flights.
British Airways said it regularly assessed the safety of its routes. BA said it would not confirm flight routes, but that it ""would never fly a route unless it was safe to do so"".
The plane came down early on Saturday, shortly after leaving the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the Russian city of St Petersburg.
Russian and French investigators have joined the Egyptian-led probe, along with experts from Airbus, which is headquartered in France.
Egyptian officials said some bodies had been recovered within a radius of 5km on Saturday, but that of a three-year-old girl was found 8km from the scene.
One un-named official told Reuters the plane appeared to have split in two, with one part burning up and the other crashing into a rock.
The plane's black boxes have been found and sent for analysis, officials said.
Russia's transport regulator said on Sunday it is to check all the airline's A-321 planes, but Kogalymavia this would not affect their operations.
Egypt's civil aviation minister Hossam Kamal said there had been no sign of any problems on board the flight, contradicting earlier reports that the pilot had asked to make an emergency landing.
The widow of the plane's co-pilot told Russian TV her husband had complained about the aircraft's technical condition.
The plane was carrying 217 passengers, including 25 children, Russian transport authorities said. There were seven crew members on board.
Most of the passengers were Russian, but at least three were Ukrainian and one Belarusian.
The first bodies to be returned to Russia are expected to be flown to St Petersburg on Sunday.

More than 12,000 people were left £20m out of pocket after the Cornwall-based firm collapsed in October 2010.
Three other people involved in the scam were jailed in June.
Crown Currency director Peter Benstead, 72, killed himself during the trial.
Benstead spent customer cash on a £900,000 luxury house in Penzance, a second home in the Dordogne and spent £36,000 on a seven week cruise.
Jurors were told James, who stood down as Tory chairman of Mendip District Council in the wake of the allegations, knew the dire state of the company.
Judge Michael Gledhill said James' public service to Glastonbury as mayor in 2009, ""paled into insignificance"" in comparison to his role in the frauds.",A former mayor of Glastonbury has been jailed for 42 months for his involvement in a foreign currency exchange scam.

"Hallel Yaffa Ariel, 13, who had US citizenship, was attacked as she slept inside her bedroom in Kiryat Arba.
A security guard who responded to the incident was wounded before the attacker was shot dead by other guards.
Later on Thursday, a Palestinian stabbed and injured two Israelis in the coastal city of Netanya before being shot dead by a passing civilian.
The Palestinian health ministry identified the Kiryat Arba assailant as Mohammed Tarayreh, 19, from the nearby village of Bani Naim.
Thirty-four Israelis have now been killed in a wave of knife, gun and car-ramming attacks since October. More than 200 Palestinians - mostly attackers, Israel says - have also been killed in that period.
The assailants who have been killed have been shot either by their victims or by security forces as they carried out attacks. Some attackers have been arrested.
In Thursday's incident, the attacker infiltrated Kiryat Arba before entering Hallel Ariel's home, which is next to a fence surrounding the settlement.
Israeli media report that the girl was repeatedly stabbed in the upper body.
She was taken in a critical condition to the Shaare Zedek Medical Centre in Jerusalem, where she died shortly after arriving, hospital officials say.
The security guard, believed to be a 30-year-old man, reportedly suffered multiple stab and gunshot wounds when he confronted the attacker. He is in a serious condition at the Hadassah Medical Centre in Ein Karem.
Following the attack, Israeli troops sealed off Bani Naim and began preparations to demolish Tarayreh's home.
""The horrifying murder of a young girl in her bed underscores the bloodlust and inhumanity of the incitement-driven terrorists that we are facing,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.
""The entire nation deeply identifies with the family's pain and declares to the murderers: You will not break us.""
The US state department spokesman confirmed the victim had been a US citizen.
Adnan Tarayreh, a cousin of the killer, said Mohammed Tarayreh had dropped out of school and had been working in a bakery, the Associated Press news agency reports.
The family, he was quoted as saying, had been surprised by the attack and he speculated that his cousin might have been spurred into action by the death of another cousin killed while attempting to ram his vehicle into Israelis in Kiryat Arba.
Kiryat Arba is located on the outskirts of the flashpoint city of Hebron, where many of the recent wave of attacks have taken place.
Also on Thursday, a senior United Nations official cited a long-awaited report by the Middle East Quartet as saying that hopes for peace between Israel and the Palestinians were being severely undermined by three ""negative trends"".
Nickolay Mladenov told the UN Security Council that they were continuing violence, terrorism and incitement; Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank; and a lack of control of the Gaza Strip by the Palestinian Authority.
The Quartet - which comprises the UN, the European Union, United States and Russia - was likely to release the report on Friday, he said.
The last round of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians came to an end amid acrimony in April 2014.

"Ms Saunders will head the Crown Prosecution Service when Keir Starmer stands down in October.
The career CPS lawyer has overseen some of the country's most important prosecutions and is currently the organisation's London chief.
The DPP is the most senior criminal prosecutor in England and Wales, responsible for more than 6,800 staff.
By Clive ColemanLegal correspondent, BBC News
The role of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is critical within the criminal justice system of England and Wales.
The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is the organisation that can deliver justice by making independent decisions as to whether there is sufficient evidence to charge a suspect, and when it decides that there is, by prosecuting the case effectively.
It works closely with the police but must always be seen to make independent and dispassionate decisions based upon the evidence gathered.
It can only prosecute when it concludes that there is sufficient evidence for there to be a realistic prospect of conviction, and that the prosecution is in the public interest.
The DPP is the hands-on, day-to-day head of the CPS - which is currently negotiating a period of austerity and modernisation. Maintaining public confidence in it will be critical.
The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve, said: ""Alison will make an excellent director of public prosecutions and is the right person to help the Crown Prosecution Service meet the challenges it will face in the coming years.
""I am particularly pleased that Alison is the first head of the CPS to be appointed from within its ranks as proof of the high quality of the professionals that work within the service.
""I'd also like to thank Keir Starmer for the great contribution he has made - not only to the CPS but more generally to the criminal justice system.  He can be proud of the reforms that he and his staff have led to keep our criminal justice system one of the best in the world.""
Ms Saunders said: ""I am delighted and privileged to be appointed as the next director of public prosecutions. To lead an organisation of committed and professional staff is an honour, especially having worked for the CPS since its inception.""
Ms Saunders spent the early part of her career prosecuting in south London before working on CPS policy in relation to child victims and witnesses.
In 2001 she became chief crown prosecutor for Sussex and oversaw the prosecution of Roy Whiting for the abduction and murder of eight-year-old Sarah Payne.
She then briefly left the CPS to join government as a deputy legal adviser to the attorney general. On her return, she set up the CPS organised crime division which deals with complex cases including human trafficking, drugs, counterfeiting and money laundering across borders.
In 2009 Alison Sanders was named chief crown prosecutor for London, which deals with more than 200,000 cases a year.
She oversaw the successful 2012 prosecution of two of the men who attacked and killed Stephen Lawrence in 1993. She also oversaw the huge number of prosecutions in London in relation to the August 2011 rioting, which led to 1,000 people being jailed.","The new director of public prosecutions is to be Alison Saunders, the attorney general has announced."
"The principal of Saint Ignatius College in the northern Sydney suburb of Riverview has informed former and current pupils of the allegations.
Paul Hine said in his letter that the allegations concerned ""child sexual abuse over 30 years ago"".
The Roman Catholic college is among the country's top private schools.
Mr Hine said the college was assisting New South Wales police with the complaint, which was made to the standards office of the Australian Province of the Society of Jesuits, the owners of the school.
In a statement, Mr Hine said: ""The College and the Jesuits wish to express, in the strongest possible terms, their abhorrence of sexual misconduct or any form of abuse involving children.
""We wish to respond to past abuse and suffering with a commitment to healing, openness and accountability.""
Mr Hine also encouraged any person who ""believed they were harmed"" while in the care of the school to get in touch.
As well as Mr Abbott, the school was attended by Barnaby Joyce, the minister for agriculture, and Anthony Fisher, who is archbishop of Sydney.
In 1997, Peter Bohrsmann, a 57-year-old teacher at the school, took his own life on school grounds after he was accused of sexual abuse. Bohrsmann had denied the allegations.

The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said the documents included information relating to seven children.
The ICO said the council had ""no good reason"" for breaching confidentiality.

The council apologised for the data breach and said it had tightened procedures.
Steve Eckersley, ICO head of enforcement, said: ""The council had disposed of some furniture as part of an office move but had failed to ensure that the cabinets were empty before disposal.
""Councils have a duty to look after any personal information they hold, all the more so when highly sensitive information is concerned - in particular about adults and children in vulnerable circumstances.
""For no good reason Norfolk County Council appears to have overlooked the need to ensure it had robust measures in place to protect this information.
""It should have had a written procedure in place which made it clear that any storage items removed from the office which may have contained personal were thoroughly checked before disposal.""
The ICO added that having the ""appropriate staff and procedures in place is key to ensuring councils look after personal information properly"".
Simon George, executive director for finance and commercial services at the council, said: ""We want to reassure residents that we have robust data protection procedures and have tightened practice in the light of the case published today.
""As a council we take data protection very seriously and we are very sorry that our practice fell short on this occasion.

The miss cost Un-Nooh £44,000 in total.
Robertson, the 2013 champion, made a 145 in the next frame to claim the highest break of the tournament and eased to victory.
Un-Nooh's gut-wrenching error, after several astonishing pots had kept his hopes of a maximum alive, partly kept Trump's troubles out of the limelight.

"Lukas Jutkiewicz missed an early Blues penalty after Che Adams was fouled.
Adams was then sent off following a 23rd-minute challenge on Martin Cranie but Jonathan Grounds put Birmingham ahead four minutes before the break.
Craig Gardner doubled the lead from Blues' second penalty, following Dean Whitehead's foul on Jacques Maghoma.
Victory kept Birmingham out of the relegation zone and, with just one match remaining, they are two points above Blackburn and Nottingham Forest but have an inferior goal difference.
In a tense atmosphere in front of a 26,914 near full house, Blues wasted a glorious chance with their missed eighth-minute penalty, after Adams was brought down by Mark Hudson.
Joel Coleman dived to his right to save Jutkiewicz's low spotkick - and worse followed when Adams was given his straight red card by referee Mike Jones.
But, against the odds, despite being a man short and having lost club captain Paul Robinson for his indiscretion in last weekend's 1-0 local derby defeat at Aston Villa, the hosts rallied.
They took the lead when Gardner's right-wing cross was headed back across the goal by Jutkiewicz and Grounds forced the ball home at the near post - for only his second goal of the season.
Then boyhood Blues fan Gardner scored only his second goal since returning to the club in January when he took over penalty-taking duties after Maghoma had been brought down.
Huddersfield, who made 10 changes after being assured a play-off place with Tuesday's 1-0 win at Wolves, drop two places to fifth ahead of next Sunday's final home game against ex-Terriers boss Neil Warnock's Cardiff.
This was only City's third win in 24 Championship games, lifting them a place to 20th as Forest lost at QPR.
Blues have a considerably worse goal difference than both Forest and Blackburn going into the final day on Sunday, 7 May.
New manager Redknapp and his assistant Steve Cotterill must now take their side to Bristol City, where Cotterill was manager from December 2013 to January 2016, knowing only a win will guarantee safety.
If either 21st-placed Forest or 22nd-placed Blackburn fail to win then Blues will be safe regardless of their own result at Ashton Gate.
But Forest, who are at home to Ipswich, and Rovers, who are at Brentford, will send Redknapp's side down if they both earn final-day victories while Blues fail to win.
Birmingham caretaker boss Harry Redknapp told BBC WM:
""Amazing, To miss a penalty in the first 10 minutes, then have a man harshly sent off, it was an awful start, but the lads showed a lot of character.
""We defended fantastically. The back four stood strong, as did our four across the middle. They did their jobs and Lukas Jutkiewicz up front held the ball up well and caused problems when he had the chance.
""It was a great team effort and Michael Morrison gave a real captain's performance. He put himself up to play and proved a real leader for us.""
Huddersfield boss David Wagner:
""At Wolves I made five changes and everyone knows my rotation policy is part of my idea in a busy Championship.
""Changes were necessary with our thoughts to the play-offs as no one knows what will happen over the next month.
""It is unfair talking about my starting XI because I wanted fresh players.
""At the moment we are not getting consistent results but we have been able to stay in the top six and progress to the play-offs for the first time in 45 years.""

"At an event in New York on Monday, Madonna, Beyonce, Kanye West, and 13 other performers announced they had become co-owners of Tidal.
The service launched last October, but was recently bought by rapper Jay Z.
It is hoping to compete with the likes of Spotify, Deezer and Google Play.
However Tidal offers 25 million music tracks, fewer than the 30 million offered by many rival services.
As well as a standard subscription for $9.99 a month, Tidal offers a ""high fidelity"" option for $19.99, which claims to deliver better sound quality.
Singer Alicia Keys spoke on behalf of the artists as they all lined up on stage at Skylight at Moynihan Station in Manhattan.
Describing the event as a ""graduation"", she said the artists hoped Tidal would alter musical evolution.
""So we come together before you on this day, March 30th, 2015, with one voice in unity in the hopes that today will be another one of those moments in time, a moment that will forever change the course of music history.""
Their mission, she said, goes beyond commerce and technology.
""Our intent is to preserve music's importance in our lives,'' she said.
Notably, the majority of the company will be owned by artists, a symbolic move in a business where musicians often have little control over how their work is distributed and consumed.
Jay Z's strategy will include encouraging artists to lobby their labels to give Tidal new music a week in advance of other services, giving it a short window of exclusivity.
He told Billboard: ""We didn't like the direction music was going and thought maybe we could get in and strike an honest blow.
""Will artists make more money? Even if it means less profit for our bottom line, absolutely. That's easy for us. We can do that. Less profit for our bottom line, more money for the artist; fantastic.""","Some of the biggest names in entertainment have re-launched the music subscription service Tidal, which they are billing as the first artist-owned platform for music and video."
"The UK government is now set to spell out its aims for new customs arrangements.
But what is the difference between a free trade area, single market and a customs union?
You can be in the EU's Single Market, but not the EU, this is what Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein do.
The European Union's single market is perhaps the most ambitious type of trade co-operation. That's because as well as eliminating tariffs, quotas or taxes on trade, it also includes the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.
That is why there has been no limit on the number of French people who can come to the UK, or the number of British people who can live in Spain - but there are limits on Turks or Ukrainians, for example.
Also, a single market strives to remove so-called ""non-tariff barriers"" - different rules on packaging, safety and standards and many others are abolished and the same rules and regulations apply across the area.
There are EU-wide regulations covering a whole host of industries and products on everything from food standards and the use of chemicals to working hours and health and safety. It is an attempt to create a level playing field and a single market; this does not happen in a free trade zone.
For goods, the single market was largely completed in 1992, but the market for services remains a work in progress a quarter of a century later. The EU has promised to introduce it many times, but several countries have dragged their feet and it is much more complicated than creating a single market for say, cars or computers. Even so, the City of London dominates financial services in the EU not least because it can do business in every member country.
The EU is therefore not just a free trade area - it is a single market.
But to stay in the single market, countries have to allow the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. That last one means immigration is difficult if not impossible to control - although the UK might get a special deal to allow some limits.
Membership of the single market also normally involves making annual payments towards the EU's budget and accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which would cross quite a few red lines for many Brexiteers.
Turkey is part of a customs union with the EU but not in the single market. The deal does not cover food or agriculture, services or government procurement.
The EU is not only a single market - it is also a customs union. The countries club together and agree to apply the same tariffs to goods from outside the union.
Once goods have cleared customs in one country, they can be shipped to others in the union without further tariffs being imposed.
If the UK left the Customs Union but stayed in the Single market, our exporters would  have to contend with what are called 'rules of origin'.
These rules are designed to demonstrate that goods that legally originated in the UK - and did not contain more than the maximum permitted level of parts and components from elsewhere - qualify for duty-free entry into the EU.
Fish factor
That could be complicated for many companies that import components from around the world to put into finished products made in the UK.
Also services are a huge part of the British economy, 78%, and are not totally covered by a customs union because they tend to face ""non tariff"" barriers.
Still the UK could opt to leave the single market but stay in the customs union, but that does mean it couldn't negotiate free trade deals with other countries, the EU does that.
It might also mean paying money to the EU and accepting ECJ judgements when they relate to trade and it is unlikely to cover farm produce or fish since the UK would not be in the Common Agricultural Policy or Common Fisheries Policy.
A customs union does however have one big advantage, it means the Ireland/Northern Ireland border would remain open and easy to cross.
If we left both the single market and the customs union we could negotiate a free  trade deal with the EU. A free trade area is one where there are no tariffs or taxes or quotas on goods and/or services from one country entering another.
The negotiations to establish them can take years and there are normally exceptions.
So agriculture and fisheries might be exempted, certain industries protected and some goods may not be covered.
Services like banking and education also pose a problem in many free trade deals, as the barrier to trading services are not normally tariffs, but so called non-tariff barriers like different rules, standards and qualifications.
So the negotiations can be very long and complicated and the result can still leave many barriers to trade.
There is a free trade zone in Europe and we helped to create it: EFTA, the European Free Trade Association. It counts Norway, Iceland, Switzerland and Liechtenstein as members, but they now have a very close relationship with the EU; all but Switzerland are part of the single market.
The EU also has free trade arrangements with many other countries around the world; so it is not against negotiating one with the UK in principle, but compared with staying in the single market or the customs union this would be the ""hardest"" form of Brexit. It would also almost certainly mean border controls including between Ireland and Northern Ireland.",Two leading cabinet ministers have said that the UK will not remain in the single market or customs union during the transitional period planned for immediately after leaving the European Union.

Colombia is also the scene of the continent's longest-running armed conflict.
For more than 50 years, Farc rebels have been fighting the Colombian government.
The jungle area between Colombia and Panama was for years a rebel stronghold.
From a helicopter, Gen Abrego points out small hamlets in Darien province, on the Panamanian side of the border.
""This is where the Farc would hold its football tournament,"" he says pointing to a clearing in the jungle.
""And this is where they would rest after carrying out their attacks.""
In 2008, almost two-thirds of Darien province was under rebel control, he says.
Combating the rebels has been no mean feat for Panama, which, along with Costa Rica, is one of only two countries in Latin America not to have a standing army.
Panama's military was disbanded shortly after the 1989 US invasion which overthrew military ruler Gen Manuel Noriega.
A constitutional amendment in 1994 later prohibited the creation of a standing army for good.
It therefore comes as little surprise that for years Farc rebels could move almost freely from Colombia across the 225-km-long border into Darien to rest and regroup.
It is only since the creation of the Panamanian Border Police, Senafront, in 2008 that the government has had a permanent presence in the area.
That increased security presence is in Colombia's interest too. It has long been frustrated by the ease with which the rebels could escape arrest by slipping across the border.
The two countries co-operate closely on security and run a joint control post called La Union.
La Union is located on top of a mountain in dense jungle.
It sits right across one of the main routes the Farc used to enter into the country.
As we land, it is steeped in mist, giving it an eerie feel.
La Union does not consist of much more than a few wooden bunkers covered with sandbags.
The lookouts are manned by young policemen on the Panamanian side, and young soldiers on the Colombian side, all of whom look rather relaxed, almost bored.
The Colombians, who are stationed here for four months at a time, keep themselves busy by building a new accommodation hut which they hope will prove more comfortable than the tents they are currently sleeping in.
There does not seem to be much of a threat here, but Gen Abrego assures me this post and others like it are key in keeping the rebels at bay and keeping the local population safe.
""For a long time, the only authority in these parts was the commander of the 57th division of the Farc.
""We found workshops for the repair of weapons and abandoned fields because the Farc would not allow the locals to tend to them,"" he explains.
Gen Abrego says that through a ""hearts and minds"" campaign, providing residents with basic healthcare schooling and food, the police have managed to secure the allegiance of the bulk of the local population.
But with the influence of the Farc waning, a new threat has emerged.
Criminal gangs have taken over many of the drug trafficking routes from the Farc.
And they are often harder to combat than the rebels, according to Gen Abrego.
""The Farc are organised along military lines. You have leaders and deputies and loyalties and discipline,"" he explains.
""But the only thing the members of these new criminal gangs are loyal to is money.""
'''If the boss doesn't pay up, I shoot him dead,' that's how they operate.""
Gen Abrego thinks that countering the gangs' influence on the population will also become more complicated because of the huge amounts of money they offer to residents for stashing and transporting drugs.
""We'll have to do a lot more work among the locals to explain how the drugs they were paid $5,000 (Â£3,200) to hide can kill those who end up consuming them in New York,"" he says.
And as for the Farc, Gen Abrego thinks it is unlikely that all of their guerrilla fighters will demobilise, even if a peace agreement is reached.
""They will continue to be run as a drug cartel,"" he says.
""I think it's difficult to imagine how someone who has seen how millions of dollars can be made trafficking drugs will settle for making $600 as a park ranger.""
""Maybe it's not impossible, but I think it's highly unlikely.""","""Peace is not a bad thing, but it's unlikely to solve our problems,"" says Director of Panama's Border Police, Frank Abrego."
"The Syrian leader also said the army faced a shortage of soldiers.
A day earlier, he declared an amnesty for draft-dodgers and deserters.
The conflict is thought to have left more than 230,000 dead and displaced millions. Vast areas are no longer under government control.
Syria's conscript army was once 300,000 strong, but has been roughly halved by deaths, defections, and a rise in draft-dodging, AFP news agency said.
The Syrian leader said the army did not have the manpower to defend the entire country, especially as rebel groups were receiving increased support from outside - a reference to Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Qatar.
""Sometimes, in some circumstances, we are forced to give up areas to move those forces to the areas that we want to hold onto,"" Mr Assad said in a televised speech to dignitaries in Damascus.
""We must define the important regions that the armed forces hold onto so it doesn't allow the collapse of the rest of the areas.""
The BBC's Jim Muir - in neighbouring Lebanon - says it has been evident for some months that Syrian government forces have been focusing on defending certain key areas while not doing everything they might to defend outlying regions where the army is really overstretched.
This year, the Syrian military has lost the north-western provincial capital Idlib, parts of the south, and Palmyra in the north-east, which was taken over by militants of Islamic State.
Bashar Assad said he was sure the army could defend the core areas where it was consolidating - meaning Damascus, the cities of Homs and Hama and the coast.
But other big cities such as Aleppo in the north and Deraa in the south may come under question, our correspondent says.
However, Mr Assad pledged to fight on and ruled out the prospect of any negotiated settlement at the moment.
""The word defeat does not exist in the Syrian army's dictionary,"" he said, adding that  ""collapse"" was not on the cards.
""We will resist and we will win.""
The Syrian army, which is fighting rebels and jihadist groups, began a recruitment drive at the start of July to try to tackle its manpower shortage.
At least 70,000 men have avoided military service, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
More than 80,000 soldiers and pro-government militiamen have been killed since the start of the conflict in March 2011.","The Syrian army has been forced to give up some areas in order to retain others in the war against rebels, now in its fifth year, President Bashar al-Assad has acknowledged."
"Conservative MPs cheered as English and Welsh members prepared to give their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies.
Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said he was ""very proud"" to be implementing the reforms.
But the SNP said the changes were ""driving Scotland out of the door"".
They were introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland.
Where parts of a bill are deemed to only affect England, or England and Wales, a new stage is added to the usual law-making process at which only MPs for English - or English and Welsh - constituencies can vote.
Following the end of the Housing Bill's report stage, Speaker John Bercow suspended the sitting of the Commons for five minutes before finalising which provisions applied to which nations.
After MPs debated the new rules - MPs representing Scottish constituencies were entitled to speak but not to vote - the ""consent motion"" for England and Wales was agreed without a division.
The Housing Bill, which includes an extension of the right-to-buy for housing association tenants in England, was later approved by all MPs at third reading stage.","New ""English votes for English laws"" rules have been implemented in the House of Commons for the first time."
"Luis Suarez scored four goals, while Lionel Messi also helped himself to a hat-trick and Neymar missed a penalty.
Valencia's cause was not helped when defender Shkodran Mustafi was sent off for fouling Messi in the first half.
Neville is also without a league win in eight attempts since taking over the club in December.
Former England and Manchester United full-back Neville was returning to the scene of one of his greatest triumphs.
As a 24-year-old he was part of the United team who won the Champions League with a spectacular late comeback against Bayern Munich in the 1999 final at the Nou Camp.
This time there was to be no miraculous turnaround.
These are testing times for the 40-year-old who was already under pressure before the game against the European champions.
The Copa del Rey had hitherto offered eight-time Premier League winner Neville some solace after five draws and three defeats in La Liga.
All four of his wins from 14 games in charge in Spain have come in this competition - yet this was nothing short of embarrassing.
Valencia were shocking from start to finish and there was only going to be one outcome once Barca went 2-0 up in 12 minutes.
Suarez broke the deadlock after racing on to Neymar's pass before the former Liverpool player doubled the lead, curling home from 10 yards after a breathless move.
Messi completed a delightful move to make it 3-0 before a frantic end to the half.
The Argentina star was denied by the bar and Neymar hit the post from the penalty spot - after being fouled by Mustafi, who was sent off.
It went from bad to worse in the second half, Suarez's back-heel allowing Messi to pick his spot inside the area and take his career tally to 500 goals.
Terrible defending by Valencia allowed Messi to complete his hat-trick and make it 5-0 after winning the ball back before firing past the keeper, who should have saved.
Suarez's hat-trick goal was a close-range header and there was still time for the Uruguay international to get his fourth - and Barca's seventh - as he found the net via the near post.
The return leg takes place at the Mestalla next Wednesday.
As bad as Valencia were, Barcelona produced an exhibition of exquisite football, a masterclass in finishing.
Luis Enrique's name was chanted by the home fans who are starting to believe their team can end the season with five trophies.
Having already sealed the Uefa Super Club and Fifa Club World Cup, they are three points clear at the top of La Liga with one game in hand. They also face Arsenal in the last 16 of the Champions League.
Barca are in terrific form at the right stage of the season, sweeping aside all before them. They look an unstoppable force.
It is perhaps just as well Valencia are not at home on Sunday - Neville's team travel to face Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday. Barcelona are away at bottom club Levante on the same day.",Gary Neville's Valencia suffered a humiliating defeat as they were crushed by Barcelona in the Copa del Rey semi-final first leg at the Nou Camp.
"Photographer Mustafa Saeed spent eight days travelling across in Somalia's self-declared republic of Somaliland with charity Save the Children, meeting pastoralist families whose lives have been ruined by drought.
Thousands of children are malnourished, families have lost their livelihoods, and fathers are absent as they travel to sell what cattle they have left.
Sixteen million people across Somalia (including Somaliland), Kenya, Ethiopia and South Sudan need food, water and medical treatment, according to the UK's Disasters and Emergency Committee.
""These pastoralist families are representative of the many Somali families across the Horn of Africa who are affected by this drought,"" says Saeed.
""Their livestock is their bank account - it is the currency that they depend on to live, and they have been watching their animals die.
""They are still waiting for help, telling me about their needs for food, water, and shelter.
""It was an emotionally exhausting experience, especially seeing the scale of the situation and knowing there are so many people out there who need our help.
""But whatever difficulties I faced when taking these photos, I know it is nothing when compared to the emotional state of these families who are suffering from the drought.""
After most of her livestock died, Shukri came, with two of her three children, to Burao and settled in the area surrounding the local airport in the hope that her few surviving sheep could find pasture.
""We came here hoping to feed our livestock,"" she says, ""But the grass was finished and our livestock died. Now, we have to remain here. We have nothing left.""
Many pastoralists are abandoning their nomadic lives as herders and making their way to small urban centres such as Ainabo, hoping to receive food aid from the local communities and international organisations.
Fardus says: ""After our livestock died, we were left with nothing to eat, We have no food, no water, and no proper shelter. We have nothing. I came here so that my children might have something to eat.""
Saado travelled from the drought-stricken eastern region of Somaliland, after a 100 of her livestock died, and settled with her four children in the west of the country, near the town of Dilla. More of her livestock died here, and her remaining 50 sheep and goats are too weak to produce milk or to sell at the market.
Saado and her children are eating one meal of rice per day. Her youngest daughter has been diagnosed with malnutrition at a recent health screening.
""Our biggest need now is food,"" says Saado. ""We need to get food so that my children can get stronger.""
""We used to be pastoralists and then the drought happened and we lost all but a few of our livestock, so we came here,"" says Khadra.
""Everyone here who has lost their livestock has been through a lot. We have no homes, just these makeshift tents. Some of the local shops have lent us food, and recently some organisations have been helping us.""
Deeqa's family has lost a 100 head of cattle, and the few surviving livestock are too weak to be of value.
""The drought has put our family in a difficult situation. We don't have access to clean water,"" she says, ""and as a mother, I don't even have enough food to feed my children.""
After losing a number of their animals to the drought, Indhodeeq and her family abandoned their life as rural herders and sought refuge in the town of Kiridh. They were given this small shed to live in by people in the town.
""Our immediate needs are food and water and a proper shelter for the children to live in,"" she says.
Indhodeeq received a cash transfer from Save the Children, which she used to buy food, milk and medicine for the family.
She is pictured here with one of her granddaughters on her lap, her husband, Noor, who is blind, and her daughter Hodan, who recently fell ill after giving birth.
Hodan, a mother of five, holds her two-year-old son, Harun, in the town of Kiridh. Harun went blind following a bout of illness as an infant, and he is now suffering from severe malnutrition. The nearest hospital is several hours away, and Hodan, who has lost over half of her cattle, is struggling to feed her children and get treatment for Harun.
Ubah has received an initial distribution of food aid but still struggles without a proper shelter and a lack of clean water.
She says: ""We lost all of our goats and most of our camels. My husband has taken the surviving camels to market. When we lost our livestock our life became very harsh, so we came here hoping we will be registered by the aid organisations.""
After she was divorced from her husband, Fadumo travelled with her three children to an informal settlement outside of Yogoori. Her one-year-old son, Kulmiye, has been diagnosed with malnutrition, and she was recently registered for a cash transfer programme by Save the Children.
""I have no livestock, no money, no shelter. I need help for my children,"" she says.",All photographs by Mustafa Saeed
"The students began ""feeling unwell"" at Llanwern High School, in Newport, at about 11.40 BST on Thursday.
One 14-year-old girl, five girls aged 13, two girls aged 12 and an 11-year-old boy were taken to Royal Gwent Hospital.
Laboratory tests are under way to determine what the substance was.
Police said not all the pupils required hospital treatment but were taken as a precaution. Eight of the nine have now been discharged.
Gwent Police said inquiries were ongoing to find out the exact circumstances of what happened and where the substance was obtained.
The Welsh Ambulance Service sent three rapid response cars, three emergency ambulances and an urgent care service vehicle to the school.
A council spokesman said on Thursday: ""Our immediate priority is the well-being of the pupils affected.

"Vale are seven points outside the top six with three games left, but Alnwick says adding to his 13 shut-outs this season is a good target to aim for.
""We want to win every game and see where we finish,"" Alnwick, 22, told BBC Radio Stoke.
""Hopefully we can win all of them with clean sheets.""
Twelfth-placed Vale have won their last two games - including the team they are chasing in sixth place, Gillingham - without conceding.
However, they need to win all of their remaining matches and hope for an unlikely set of results to go their way if they are to sneak into the promotion picture.
""We're disappointed we're not right in the mix coming into the last few games,"" Alnwick said.
""Our defensive record has been good all year - personally I'm happy with the way things have gone, people were putting us as favourites to go down but we've had a good season.""
Vale boss Rob Page may choose to stick with the 3-5-2 formation that proved so effective in their 2-0 win at Gillingham, in Saturday's home game against another side chasing a top-six finish, Rochdale.
""The manager threw it at us as he wanted to match Gillingham up,"" he said.
""I think it was tactically very well done, the lads liked it.""",Goalkeeper Jak Alnwick is determined to finish the season with three more clean sheets as Port Vale chase an unlikely play-off place in League One.
"The Children and Social Work Bill would let local councils apply to set aside children's rights and checks on care to try out innovative ways of working.
The government argues it is a bold approach to removing red tape.
But campaigners say allowing councils to opt out of these long-standing duties is risky and unnecessary.
The legal duties affected by the Bill relate to nearly all the social care services children receive from local authorities laid down in numerous acts of Parliament.
These include statutory rights on child protection, family support, children's homes and fostering, support to care leavers and services for disabled children.
About 50 organisations publicly oppose the proposed exemptions - including the British Association of Social Workers, The Care Leavers' Association, Women's Aid, Liberty and the National Association of People Abused in Childhood.
They have banded together to form a group called Together for Children to oppose the Bill, which was debated by a House of Lords committee on Tuesday.
The organisation said: ""Children's social care laws have evolved over many decades, often in response to failures in care and protection but also because of new knowledge and understanding.""
Carolyne Willow, director of independent children's rights organisation Article 39, said: ""More than 107,000 members of the public have signed a petition opposing the plan.
""With such a radical and unprecedented change to children's law, it's not unreasonable to demand a Green and White Paper consultation.
""We have been unable to find any example of any other country which allows councils to opt out of their duties to very vulnerable children and young people, including those the state is directly responsible for by law.""
If the Bill becomes law, local authorities would be able to apply to the Secretary of State to be exempted from one or more legal duties for a period of three years, initially, so it can try out new ways of working. This could then be extended for a further three years.
The government argues this would allow children's services departments to pilot new ways of working and potentially achieve better outcomes. It also insists no-one would be put at risk.
A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Local authorities should have the freedom to work with social workers so they can develop new and effective ways of supporting the vulnerable children in their care.
""We know that over-regulation can get in the way of good social work practice and the power to innovate will allow us to test new approaches in a carefully controlled and monitored way. To suggest it would place children at risk is simply wrong.""
It comes after a government-commissioned review of social work suggested departments were tied up in procedural knots and tick-box regulations.
But children's groups, as well as peers who debated the bill, argue there is no need to scrap key planks of primary legislation which guarantee children's rights, to allow innovation.
They argue that it is more the rules, regulations and guidance attached to that legislation that could be set aside.
The Bill has seen significant sections defeated by crossbench and Labour peers in the Lords, but these have largely been reinstated in new clauses.
Shadow children's minister Emma Lewell-Buck said ministers had turned a deaf ear to reasoned objections, by reintroducing these proposals with minimal amendments.
""This legislation breaks with the post-war consensus of protecting the most vulnerable children in our communities, by removing the obligations on local authorities to carry out a series of measures which benefit them.
""It could allow local authorities to fail to provide accommodation to looked-after children, remove the requirement to assess the needs of disabled children as they approach adulthood and even prevent children in care having reasonable contact with their parents.""

"The demonstrators expressed their anger over the handling of the case by President Enrique Pena Nieto.
The president's popularity rating has dropped to its lowest point since he took office two years ago.
The students disappeared after clashing with police in the town of Iguala on 26 September.
The case has shocked Mexicans as allegations of police collusion with drug gangs surfaced during the investigation into their disappearance.
In October, Mexico's attorney general ordered the arrest of Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca.
Many of the protesters carried placards calling for the president to step down, says the BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City.
In Guerrero state, where the students disappeared, they set cars on fire and smashed windows, our correspondent adds.
On Monday, President Pena Nieto submitted a package of ten reforms aimed at tackling the crisis to Congress for debate.
Some of the more controversial proposals include replacing all 1,800 municipal police forces with state-level units.
The president also wants extra powers to shut down local governments considered to have been ""infiltrated"" by drug cartels.
Mr Pena Nieto has announced he will travel to Iguala later this week. He has not visited the town since the students went missing.
The students had travelled from a teacher training college in Ayotzinapa to the town of Iguala in Guerrero state to protest against what they say are discriminatory hiring practices for teachers which favour urban students over rural ones.
Police opened fire on the students, who were in buses travelling back from Iguala to their college. Three of them were killed and three more people in nearby vehicles also died.
A busload of the students attempted to flee but were chased by municipal officers who then took them to the local police station.
Some of the officers, who have since been arrested, told investigators they then handed the students over to a local drug gang called Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors).
The leader of the gang, who has also been detained, said that he had been told by one of his men that the 43 were members of a rival gang.
He then reportedly ordered that they be ""made to disappear"".
Members of the gang have told investigators they killed the students and burned their bodies at a rubbish dump.
Remains found at the site have been sent for testing to a laboratory in Austria.

Caixinha said Baptista felt the players were tense, but stressed he did not believe they were frightened by the occasion or their opponent.
The Portuguese was asked about his tactics for the game, prompting a detailed response, outlining what he had hoped his players would execute.
""We organised our defending in three ways. The first one was to try to place a high block - if you see they were trying to build from the back - they open the centre-halves and Scott (Brown) is always in the middle. We had three players down there,"" he explained.
""In the middle of the park what we were trying to get them to play the ball to (Mikael) Lustig, block it, block Brown who was making the triangle with the centre-halves, and with this block we could have space to explore after we regain possession.
""We could not do it in this match because we were a little bit lower on the pitch. In the lower block, we were expecting not to allow them to divide the game.
""We just played wide when the spaces were inside. The idea was for our wingers to come inside and fill the space.""
Despite seemingly thorough planning, Caixinha accepted his strategy had failed to work.
""The game-plan is one thing, what we put in practice was a totally different thing,"" he acknowledged.
""So it wasn't our day. We couldn't perform the way we prepared. We expected more from our players but we need to keep going.

""As a result we have instructed our solicitor to commence a prosecution against the driver.""
The family's statement came after the Crown Office said: ""There are no findings in the determination that undermine the decisions not to prosecute the driver.
""There was no finding that the driver knew or ought to have known that he was unfit to drive.""
The statement concluded: ""We note the sheriff's findings on the driver's motivation to retain or gain employment.
""It is important to note the sheriff was considering evidence at an FAI where a lesser standard of proof is required and where more relaxed rules of evidence apply.
""A criminal prosecution requires sufficient evidence to the much higher standard beyond reasonable doubt.""
The fatal accident inquiry (FAI) at Glasgow Sheriff Court, before Sheriff John Beckett, was set up after the Crown Office decided not to prosecute anyone over the crash.
The inquiry, which concluded in August, examined the circumstances of the tragedy.
Sheriff Beckett's determination is critical in particular of driver Harry Clarke, stating outright that the crash might have been avoided had he not lied about his medical history.
But there are also implications for Glasgow City Council and potentially all local authorities; for doctors and GPs; and for the DVLA and driver licensing right across the UK. It includes appeals to government ministers and could see changes to the law.
As well as eight ""reasonable precautions"" which could have prevented the crash - all relating to Mr Clarke's health - the sheriff outlined 19 recommendations which could reduce the chances of such an incident recurring in future.

In his report, Sheriff Becket concluded: ""The most effective measure to prevent such an occurrence would be to seek to avoid drivers becoming incapacitated at the wheel.
""Responsibility in that regard lies with drivers themselves and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).
""It may well be that the single most useful outcome of this inquiry would be to raise awareness of the dangers involved in driving if subject to a medical condition which could cause the driver to lose control of a vehicle.""
During evidence at the inquiry, it emerged that Mr Clarke had suffered an episode of neurocardiogenic syncope.
He passed out at the wheel while the bin lorry was on Queen Street in Glasgow city centre, just days before Christmas.
Just 19 seconds later, the vehicle came to rest against the Millennium Hotel in George Square, leaving six people dead and 17 injured.
Those killed in the crash were Erin McQuade, 18, her grandparents Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, from Dumbarton, Stephenie Tait, 29, and Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow, and Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh.
After hearing five weeks of evidence earlier this year, Sheriff Beckett issued a determination which identifies eight reasonable precautions which could have prevented the tragedy.
All relate to an earlier blackout Mr Clarke experienced at the wheel of a bus on 7 April 2010 and his subsequent failure to fully disclose his medical history.
Sheriff Beckett said Mr Clarke could have ""told the whole truth"" to his doctors about this incident, ""refrained from continuing to drive buses"" and provided ""true and accurate information about his medical history"" in later health questionnaires and assessments.
Other precautions relate to doctors advising Mr Clarke to notify the DVLA and clarifying the circumstances of his blackout ""before concluding that he had suffered a simple faint"".
A final precaution would have been for his then employer, bus firm First Glasgow, to have ""provided a full, accurate and fair employment reference to Glasgow City Council"".
The inquiry heard that the council was not made aware that Mr Clarke faced disciplinary procedures at First Bus, related to repeated sick leave, when he left First Bus.
Sheriff Beckett also made 19 recommendations which covered possible legislative changes, disclosure of medical information, the DVLA, Glasgow City Council and local authorities in general.
One of the most significant is for the UK transport secretary to look at whether doctors should be given greater freedom, or an obligation, to report fitness to drive concerns directly to the DVLA.
There is also a call for the transport secretary to consult on how best to ensure that the DVLA has the proper information to make fitness to drive licensing decisions.
Sheriff Beckett said part of this should consider increasing the penalties and altering the method of prosecution for non-disclosure.
His report also calls on the DVLA to provide greater clarity and guidance on how people who suffer losses of consciousness should be treated in respect of fitness to drive.
He also recommends the DVLA should ""change its policy"" so relevant information on fitness to drive, from third parties such as the police, could be investigated.
Sheriff Beckett also said the agency should ""redouble its efforts to raise awareness of the implications of medical conditions for fitness to drive"".
A DVLA spokesman said: ""We are carefully considering the recommendations in the report.""
The General Medical Council said vital ""lessons were learned"" from the crash.
Chief executive Niall Dickson said: ""We will be studying the report in detail and any implications for the GMC and its responsibilities.
'The responsibility for informing the DVLA about medical conditions sits first and foremost with the patient.
""But doctors have responsibilities too and we are clear that they do have a vital role in helping to keep the public safe.""",A family which lost three members in the Glasgow bin lorry crash is to go ahead with a bid to stage a private prosecution of the driver.

"Bernard Watt was 28 when he was shot dead in Ardoyne in February 1971.
Soldiers told the new inquest into his killing on Monday that they shot him as he was about to throw a bomb.
But acting state pathologist Prof Jack Crane told the inquest on Tuesday that the injuries sustained by Mr Watt did not support the soldiers' claims.
One soldier had said that Mr Watt dropped a bomb he was holding when he was shot, and it had exploded and ""blew him down the street"".
Prof Crane said there was no evidence that Mr Watt had been thrown in to the air by an exploding device.
Mr Watt's family disputes the soldiers' version of events and his widow told the inquest he had no links to paramilitaries.
The new inquest into Mr Watt's killing began on Monday, and was ordered in 2012 by the attorney general, who asked for a number of controversial Troubles killings by the security forces to be re-examined.
An initial inquest held in July 1971 resulted in an open verdict.
In February, the Ministry of Defence defended a Parachute Regiment Facebook appeal asking former soldiers for information about Mr Watt's killing.","There is no evidence that a man killed during a north Belfast riot 46 years ago was holding an explosive device when he was shot, an inquest has heard."

"A spokesperson for the Co-op said two of the chocolate figures had been found to contain a small button-cell battery.
""The health and safety of our customers is our top priority,"" said the spokesperson, adding that the Co-op was investigating and the police and Food Standards Agency were being notified.
No other products are affected.
The Co-op chocolates that had been subject to tampering were bought at two locations, one in Suffolk and one in Essex.
It is thought that the tampering took place after the Santas left the factory.
Surgeons recently warned that button batteries pose a potentially deadly risk to young children.
If accidentally swallowed, the small, round batteries can get lodged in the oesophagus and burn a hole through its lining.
The most serious cases are associated with Lithium button batteries larger than 20mm (the size of a 10 pence piece) which can cause severe injury within two hours.

"York Minster Police has been given the same powers as regular police officers within the minster's precinct.
Eight constables and the cathedral's head of security were sworn in at a special ceremony on Tuesday.
The force, established in the 13th Century, lost its powers in the 1930s when officers ceased to be attested.
York Minster is one of only a handful of cathedrals to maintain its own police force. Those that do have a police force include Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, Canterbury Cathedral, St Peter's Basilica in Rome, and Washington's National Cathedral in Washington DC.
Mark Sutcliffe, Inspector of Cathedral Police at York Minster, said: ""I feel very proud of the whole team for attaining their attestation.
""It has been an important day for everyone involved but also a significant milestone in the history of the force, which has played an important role in life at the cathedral for hundreds of years.
""The attestation and training the officers have completed ensures our cathedral constables have the professional skills and powers necessary to execute their duties.""
Powers were returned to the force following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between the Chapter of York and the chief constable of North Yorkshire.
The memorandum recognises that although security provision inside the minster and its precinct remain the responsibility of cathedral constables, North Yorkshire Police will be responsible for investigating all crime.
Any arrested people will be handed over to North Yorkshire Police for transport and processing and the force will be responsible for the submission of prosecution files.
The Minster Police constabulary is thought to be the oldest continuing police service in the country.",A cathedral police force has been given back the power of arrest for the first time in nearly 80 years.
"That was the question posed in a recent Wall Street Journal column.
Meanwhile, an article in Forbes magazine describes another non-mainstream figure still in the running for the White House, the Democrat Bernie Sanders, as not having the ""first inkling of what [trade] is and why we do it"".
Let's put aside the question of how likely it is that either will become the 45th president. The fact that both have raised the issue of trade in rather striking terms is still a sign of something wider going on in US politics.
Both have expressed profound concerns about the impact of international trade on the US economy and workers. As the quotes above show, both have caused alarm or scorn among enthusiasts for trade liberalisation.
Both would represent a marked departure from decades of US trade policy which has, with some diversions on the way, followed this path.
For Mr Trump, much of the focus is specifically on China: ""Since China joined the WTO [World Trade Organization in 2001] Americans have witnessed the closure of more than 50,000 factories and the loss of tens of millions of jobs. It was not a good deal for America then and it's a bad deal now.""
He told the New York Times that he would favour a 45% tariff on imports from China, although he has subsequently said the proposal is a threat to get China to ""behave"".
He wants to put ""an end to China's illegal export subsidies and lax labour and environmental standards. No more sweatshops or pollution havens stealing jobs from American workers"".
Mr Sanders is not so far away. A release on his campaign website after a speech in Pennsylvania says: ""The North American Free Trade Agreement [Nafta, which involves the US, Canada and Mexico] cost 850,000 good-paying jobs in the United States, including 26,300 in Pennsylvania. Normalized trade relations with China [following China's accession to the WTO] led to the loss of 3.2 million jobs including 122,600 in Pennsylvania.""
Both are also exercised about the trade deficit - the fact that America buys more foreign goods than it sells abroad. They see that as a result of unfair trade agreements and as evidence that the US is losing out - ""they are killing us on trade"" is a phrase that Mr Trump has often used.
That idea is in stark contrast with the view of mainstream economics that trade liberalisation is beneficial for all countries that do it. By removing barriers that raise the cost of imported goods, countries can specialise in producing what they do best, and consumers and businesses can buy goods more cheaply.
That idea, and a desire to avoid a repeat of the Great Depression (which was aggravated though not caused by trade restrictions), is behind the gradual removal of trade barriers since World War Two.
There has been a more or less global effort to do this under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) and, from 1995, the WTO. There have also been many smaller scale moves between groups of countries, including what is now the EU.
The US has agreements already in force with 20 countries, including Mexico and Canada, under Nafta. The US has also completed negotiations with 11 other countries for a deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership and there are negotiations under way with the EU.
The mainstream view that all countries gain from trade liberalisation does not mean that all people do. It's just that the benefits exceed the losses.
It should thus be possible for everyone to gain, if the winners compensate the losers.
The US, like many other countries, has programmes to help people who lose their jobs and there is one specifically targeted at those hit by international trade, called the Trade Adjustment Assistance Programme.
One commentator described it (and its EU equivalent) as ""tiny and relatively ineffective"", adding: ""There is little political appetite in the world's two biggest economies for a more serious attempt at redistributing the gains from trade.""
And that does mean some people do lose from trade expansion. A group of academic economists in the US wrote: ""The increase in US imports from China, which accelerated after 2000, was a major force behind recent reductions in US manufacturing employment andâ€¦ it appears to have significantly suppressed overall US job growth.""
They estimate job losses of at least two million between 1999 and 2011, because of the direct and indirect impact of China's rise. They don't attribute all the manufacturing job losses to China and trade, but their analysis points to a real impact from competition from imports.
There is also research pointing to a political impact even before the current campaigns for the presidential nominations.
Analysis at Georgetown University suggests that trade does affect elections. It found that incumbent presidents tend to gain votes in areas where exports have risen, but they lose support where competition from imports has led to increased job insecurity.
And what about the US trade deficit?
Here, things get very complicated. While a trade deficit might be the result of competitive imports, it can also be caused by low levels of savings.
In fact there is a view that the trade deficit is not necessarily a bad thing. A trade deficit has to be financed by borrowing or investment from abroad, which can help drive interest rates down and stimulate job creation.
On the other hand, there is a view that those considerations don't really apply now at a time when interest rates are already very low. In those circumstances a trade deficit really can cost jobs.
It is curious that this issue should come up so strongly now. The US jobs situation is improving. The unemployment rate is 5%, and the number of people with jobs has increased by more than 600,000 this year.
The Nobel Prize winning economist, Paul Krugman, wrote: ""A protectionist backlash, like an immigration backlash, is one of those things where the puzzle has been how long it was in coming. And maybe the time is now.""","Would Donald Trump ""wreak havoc on world trade"" if he became US president?"

But, he said that Europe has been good to the company in terms of investment, air travel and giving free movement of goods.
The aerospace firm's Northern Ireland operation exports 95% of its products - 33% of them directly into Europe.
""There are strong views on either side,"" Mr Ryan wrote.
""But, I can only speak for our company's experience of operating within the EU and explain to you we believe it is better for our company that the UK remains within the EU.""
He added that by clarifying the company's position it would ""help"" employees make ""an informed decision on this very important issue"".

"It has been a long and controversial journey that began with Abid Naseer's radicalisation in Pakistan and ends in a maximum security prison in the US.
But although MI5 and police in Britain have been vindicated by the verdict in a Brooklyn federal court, this is a case which has raised a number of uncomfortable questions.
Why was Naseer not tried in the UK?
This would clearly have been the preferred route given that Naseer, a Pakistani citizen in the UK on a student visa, was accused of plotting to blow up people on the streets of a British city.
However, despite carrying out one of the largest ever counter-terrorism investigations - involving the surveillance of a dozen suspects, the Crown Prosecution Service said there was not enough evidence to put any of the men on trial.
There were emails between Naseer and a suspected al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan - allegedly coded discussions about a possible imminent attack on the city centre. But crucially no explosives or chemicals were found and no gathering of ingredients to make bombs.
The authorities felt they could not risk running the surveillance operation any longer.
Police were forced to move in more quickly than planned when secret operational details written on papers held by a senior detective were photographed as he was entering 10 Downing Street for a briefing.
A subsequent report by Lord Carlile, then the government's Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, found this would not have affected the issue of the evidence - but it criticised the lack of co-ordination between the police and the CPS during the investigation.
Why was Naseer extradited to the US?
This is one of a number of cases where critics suggest Britain is effectively sub-contracting difficult legal cases to the US - where juries are much more likely to convict terror suspects.
After the decision not to charge Naseer, the Home Office attempted to deport him to Pakistan, along with those other arrested men who had not voluntarily returned there. But the High Court blocked it because of the risk he would be mistreated.
At the same time they concluded Naseer was ""an al-Qaeda operative who posed and still poses a serious threat to the national security of the United Kingdom"".
So the UK authorities could not put him on trial, could not deport him and did not want him left free to roam the streets.
He spent a brief time on a control order but the dilemma was only resolved when US prosecutors announced they wanted to try Naseer in New York and he was extradited from the UK. They said - and the jury has now agreed - that he was part of a wider al-Qaeda conspiracy to attack Britain, America and Norway.
Lord Carlile told the BBC: ""In every case you have to find where the most convenient forum is for the trial. That will depend on where the evidence lies.
""If the evidence lies in the United States, particularly the key evidence, then one would expect the trial to be in the United States.""
What new evidence did US prosecutors have?
This has been a trial packed full of drama and interest. A string of MI5 officers wearing wigs and disguises were cross-examined by Naseer who was representing himself.
He also went toe-to-toe in court with a convicted al-Qaeda terrorist turned prosecution witness, but the two had never met.
The trial was the first to use declassified documents seized by US special forces in the raid on the Pakistan compound in which they found and killed Osama Bin Laden - the former head of al-Qaeda.
The court heard how an FBI agent waiting in a military hangar in Afghanistan for the return of their helicopter, saw Bin Laden's dead body before it was taken for burial at sea. The agent's job was to sift through the seized documents.
In a document titled Report on External Operations, one of Bin Laden's deputies told the al-Qaeda leader: ""We had sent a number of brothers to Britainâ€¦ the brother determines what targets in line with what materials he can get."" But none of the papers mentioned either Manchester or Abid Naseer.
Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Naseer's father, Nasrullah Jan Khattak, said: ""It's easy to make accusations. They say my son is al-Qaeda but there was no proper evidence. The prosecution should have presented proof that my son was planning an attack.""
Instead he claims there was testimony from surveillance officers who had observed Naseer moving around the north-west of England, saying he looked tense while on the phone.
""Whether he is happy or tense on the phone has nothing to do with al-Qaeda,"" said Naseer's father.
US prosecutors were not able to significantly strengthen the case against Naseer - but he was not able to adequately explain the coded email exchanges with the alleged al-Qaeda operative in Pakistan. The jury did not believe his account that this was innocent talk about trying to find a bride.
What would a British jury have made of this case? Well, that's a question to which we will never receive an answer.","Nearly six years after MI5 and armed police dramatically disrupted an al-Qaeda plot to launch suicide attacks on shoppers in Manchester, the ringleader has finally been convicted."

The council also plans to scrap engines in Ponteland, Seahouses and Wooler and replace them with smaller appliances.
It has to save £500,000 on top of £1.5m cuts and has just finished a three-month consultation on its proposals.
The authority said a number of concerns had been raised, including how the county would cope in the face of further flooding when fire crews are called to help.

"Saudi air strikes have been targeting Houthi rebels for almost two weeks.
The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was given permission by a Saudi-led coalition to land planes carrying staff and medical supplies.
The passenger plane landed safely on Monday but the supply flight has been unable to depart.
ICRC spokeswoman Sitara Jabeen says they had been unable to find a cargo plane to take their 48 tonnes of medical supplies into the country.
""Less and less airlines are either allowed, or able, or willing, to fly to Yemen,"" she said.
Ms Jabeen added that the country's security situation made finding a solution ""extremely difficult"" but that they were working to sort out the logistics.

The Red Cross is also trying to deploy a team of surgeons to the battle-torn city of Aden, but said that ""authorisations from all the parties involved"" were necessary before this could happen.
The ICRC spent a week negotiating with the Saudi-led coalition over deliveries of supplies.
It has called for a 24-hour ceasefire in Aden, while Russia has also urged the UN Security Council to support a ""humanitarian pause"" in the air strikes.
Explosions on Monday shook homes in the suburbs of Aden, one of President Hadi's last strongholds.
At least 53 people died in 24 hours of clashes between rebels and pro-government fighters, AFP reports.
Food, water and electricity shortages have also mounted, with residents pleading for help to feed their families.
Student Nisman Usman said: ""We have lived three days of horrors - gunshots everywhere.""
Arab views of the fight for Aden range from pro-Saudi optimism to fears of other players being dragged in.
Saudi and Gulf media report that the ""shell-shocked"" Houthis are seeking ceasefire talks in the face of the Saudi aerial bombardment. Bahrain's Akhbar al-Khalij daily and the Emirates' Al-Bayan accuse the Houthis of ""indiscriminate shelling"" of Aden residential areas.
But Arab papers elsewhere are less sanguine. Jordan's al-Ghad and Lebanon's leftist al-Safir say the Saudis have failed to halt the Houthis' advance on Aden, a development that pro-Saudi media ignore.
Pan-Arab TV channels report the fighting could draw in other players from Pakistan to Iraqi Shia militias.
Iranian media maintain their anti-Saudi stance, with official TV channels highlighting the civilian casualties of Saudi air raids and protests in various countries against Saudi policy.
A political consultant in Sanaa, Hisham al-Omeisy, told the BBC that he was sceptical that the Red Cross aid flight would go ahead.
""The Saudi coalition announced this several times before, that they will allow the ICRC to come into the airport but that hasn't actually taken place,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Pakistan's parliament is holding a special session to debate whether to join the Saudis and their allies.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, said the Saudis had asked for warships, aircraft and soldiers.
Pakistani aircraft rescued 170 people from Sanaa on Sunday. Countries including China and Egypt are planning evacuation flights, while Russia and India have already airlifted many of their nationals out of the country.
President Hadi was forced to flee Yemen two weeks ago, as the rebels advanced on Aden.
The Houthis have said their aim is to replace his government, which they accuse of being corrupt.
They are supported by troops loyal to the former President Ali Abdullah Saleh, who was ousted in the Arab Spring protests.
Saudi Arabia says the Houthis have military backing from regional rival Iran, which denies the allegation.

So what has President Trump achieved so far? In the weeks and months to come, we'll be tracking the progress he makes on his agenda and how it is received by the American public.
One way President Trump is able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders and memoranda, which allow him to bypass the legislative process in Congress in certain policy areas.
He wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege, quickly moving to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, cut business regulations and push ahead with completing the construction of two controversial pipelines.
While it may appear that President Trump has been signing executive actions at an unprecedented rate, he has signed less than President Obama did during the same period in office.
Mr Trump has used many of these actions to deliver on some of his campaign promises, but many of his promises cannot be fulfilled by executive action alone.
For example, his first executive order was designed to limit the effect of the Affordable Care Act, better know as Obamacare, but his promise of repealing and replacing it can only be enacted by Congress.
In-depth: The executive actions Trump has taken
What are presidential executive orders?
When Mr Trump took the oath of office on 20 January he did so with the lowest approval rating of any incoming president.
He dismissed those polls as ""rigged"" but the strength of the opposition to him was evident when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets the day after his inauguration.
Most presidents begin their term with strong approval numbers, but President Trump has bucked that trend. While both George W Bush and Barack Obama were enjoying approval numbers in the 60s after one month in office, Mr Trump is around the 40% mark.
Donald Trump: Unchained and unapologetic
Mr Trump won the election with low approval numbers so it's unsurprising they're still low, but the scandal over his team's contacts with Russia and his controversial travel ban have kept them falling.
Do the numbers matter? Maybe not, for now. Republicans control both the House and Senate so in theory he can pursue his legislative agenda without worrying about his ratings - as long as he keeps his Republican colleagues on side.
But if his ratings stay low or fall further, expect some dissenting voices to emerge in the party as Republicans start to worry about midterm elections in 2018.
For now though, there are signs that many of Mr Trump's supporters are happy with his progress - some we spoke to in Pennsylvania said he was doing ""a fabulous job"". You can hear their views here.
Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake
How and why did Trump's key adviser resign?
When Barack Obama became president in 2009, the US was in the midst of its worst recession since the 1930s, with the economy shedding 800,000 jobs in his first month.
But after a few dips later that year, the US economy saw its longest ever period of job creation. In total, 11.3 million jobs were created under President Obama.
President Obama and the tale of US jobs
Despite those strong numbers, President Trump described the economy as a ""mess"" and said he had ""inherited many problems"" from his predecessor.
He has vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become ""the greatest jobs president... ever"". We'll track the monthly jobs report to see what progress he makes.
President Trump has cited the strong stock market as a sign that his policies are already having an effect, saying there has been a ""tremendous surge of optimism in the business world"".
The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes all closed at record highs on 15 February in a partial sign at least that investors were encouraged by Mr Trump's planned infrastructure projects, deregulation and tax cuts.
But the president will need to avoid the backlash that followed his ban on immigrants coming into the US from seven mainly Muslim countries if he wants the stock market to continue hitting new highs.
All of the three major indexes fell slightly after Mr Trump's controversial executive order caused protests at airports across the country - and Silicon Valley lashed out at the president as well.
Latest news on the US economy
Immigration was President Trump's signature issue during the election campaign and he signed two executive orders on 25 January designed to fulfil his promises.
The first declared that the US would build a ""physical wall"" or similar ""impassable physical barrier"" - to the delight of all of those Americans who spent 2016 chanting: ""Build the wall!""
It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay it, although he has repeatedly insisted that the US will recoup the costs from the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise.
There is already some 650 miles of fencing along the border, but we'll monitor what progress President Trump makes in turning it into what he has called the ""Great Wall"".
Who is going to pay for Trump's border wall?
Mr Trump's second executive order on border security said 10,000 more immigration officers would be hired to track down illegal immigrants - but extra funds will need to be signed off by Congress before this can happen.
His talk of a crackdown on illegal immigrants makes it sound as if they had an easy ride under President Obama, but there is plenty of evidence to suggest the opposite is true.
Between 2009 and 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals - leading some to label President Obama the ""deporter-in-chief"".
At one point, Mr Trump pledged to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - but he backed away from that after the election.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency has launched a series of raids across the country since Mr Trump was elected, but it's still too early to say if deportation arrests have increased.
Has Trump started a new deportation drive?
Is arrest of 'dreamer' a sign of things to come?
Healthcare was an early test for President Trump and the Republican Party.
President Obama's Affordable Care Act helped more than 20 million previously-uninsured Americans to finally get health cover - but Mr Trump said he would act quickly to ""repeal and replace"" it.
While the Republican-controlled Congress has started efforts to repeal what's know as Obamacare, it is unclear whether they will try to replace it completely or just repair elements of it.

The scheme has faced several problems along the way and premium hikes in 2016 helped the Republicans frame it as a failure during the election campaign.
But a report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that 18 million people could lose their insurance within a year if Congress repealed parts of it without having a new system in place.
Senior Republicans have said legislation to replace it will be unveiled in March.","Donald Trump came into office promising to change the face of American politics and transfer power ""back to the people""."
"Henri van Breda, 21, is also charged with the attempted murder of his sister who survived with severe head injuries.
Mr Van Breda said in a statement that the murders were carried out by an axe-wielding intruder.
No arrests were made in this horrific case for 18 months until the accused handed himself over in June 2016.
Mr Van Breda's sister Marli is expected to be a key witness during the trial in Cape Town.
But there are concerns about how much she remembers about the night of the murders as she suffers from amnesia. She was 16 at the time of the attack.
The run-up to the trial has attracted international interest in the story of a son born into privilege allegedly unleashing a brutal attack on his family, whose fortune was estimated at $16m (Â£12.5m).
In a statement read out by his lawyer, Mr Van Breda said he was in a toilet when he saw a man wielding an axe hacking his brother Rudi in bed.
His father, who then burst in, ""trying to tackle the attacker"" was also struck by the alleged intruder, he said.
""I also recall the attacker was laughing"", he added. His mother and sister were then assaulted.
Mr Van Breda is also facing charges of tampering with a crime scene.",A man accused of killing his parents and older brother in a frenzied axe attack in Stellenbosh in South Africa has pleaded not guilty to murder.
"Willie Boy O'Neill, three, and Tojo O'Neill, two, formerly of Caldon Road, were last seen on 3 August.
They are believed to be in the company of their parents, Claire Watson, 32 and 39-year-old Robert O'Neill (39).
The children were reported missing after council officials became concerned for their welfare after failing to contact the family.
Willie Boy is described as being of slim build with fair hair, whilst Tojo is stocky with fair hair.
Since being reported missing to police last week, officers have made extensive inquiries in England - where there are family connections - to trace the family.
So far, there have been no positive sightings of the children, except for the whole family being seen together within the Rivergate Shopping Centre in Irvine at 14:45 on Sunday 3 August.
Police have appealed for anyone with information about the children's whereabouts to contact them urgently.",Police are attempting to trace two children who have been missing from the Irvine area of North Ayrshire.
"If a glut of recent studies are to be believed, its days are definitely numbered. Various reports suggest it is haemorrhaging users, that teenagers find it boring - one survey even comparing it to an infectious disease.
Such surveys, usually accompanied by a picture of boss Mark Zuckerberg looking sad, are picked up widely by the press and equally vigorously pulled apart by Facebook.
So when researchers at Princeton used Google search data to predict Facebook would lose 80% of its users within three years, the social network hit back.
Its in-house data scientists used the same methodology to predict the university would have no students by 2021 and the world would run out of air by 2060.
""As data scientists we wanted to give a fun reminder that not all research is created equal - and some methods of analysis lead to pretty crazy conclusions,"" they said.
The Princeton report's comparison of Facebook to an infectious disease missed the mark, thinks Nate Elliott, analyst with Forrester Research.
""One of Facebook's greatest strengths is its practice of regularly adding new features and functionality to its site; this both ensures it infects new users and also makes sure existing users don't become immune to its charms,"" he said in his blog.
He also pointed out net measurement firm Comscore's data that showed that 89% of US 18- to 24-year-olds used Facebook in November 2013.
""Facebook claims far more young users than any other social network - indeed, probably more than any other media property on Earth,"" he added.
Some surveys are harder for Facebook to shake off, though.
Digital agency iStrategylabs used Facebook's own social advertising data to extrapolate that three million US teenagers had left Facebook in the past three years.
It was echoed by earlier research conducted by the Pew Internet Centre research, which reported that teenagers were put off Facebook because of their parents.
The fact that notoriously capricious teenagers don't want to hang out in the same digital space with their parents will hardly come as a surprise to anyone who knows any.
Parents can be embarrassing on Facebook - they post pictures of their offspring that they find hilarious but their children don't, they add ill-advised comments to their children's status updates and they often fail to understand the basic etiquettes of online discourse.
It has led, concluded Pew, to teenagers maintaining lower profiles on Facebook while spending the majority of their time on services such as WhatsApp or Snapchat.
But while the report noted a 25% drop in the number of younger users, it indicated that there was an 80% surge in users with an age of 55 and above.
So is it a case that as Facebook gets older, so does its core audience?
""The demographic has shifted and it is a positive thing when it come to ad revenues. These older users have more spending power than young teens,"" said Ovum analyst Eden Zoller.
But she added Facebook could not afford to be complacent about its younger members because if they could be persuaded to stick with the social network, they would become the spenders of tomorrow.
""Facebook needs to keep innovating with things like mobile video apps, with mobile commerce,"" she said.
Speculation about whether Facebook can maintain its audience and its appeal are not likely to be giving Mark Zuckerberg sleepless nights anytime soon.
Especially since he got an early birthday present last week in the form of record results.
The network he started in a Harvard dormitory room, where ironically teenagers were its only demographic, now has 1.23 billion active users.
Its revenues jumped 55% to $7.87bn in 2013 while profits grew sevenfold, bringing the annual total to Â£1.5bn.
Interestingly, teen decline was off the agenda in this quarter's earnings call, in contrast to the previous one, when chief financial officer David Ebersman did admit it was losing some of its younger audience.
Shortly afterwards, Facebook's bid to buy Snapchat failed, so this time around, the social network was concentrating on the positives - mobile advertising.
This brought in a whopping $2.34bn, over half of its total revenue, with the firm promising to further improve data tracking and the usefulness of its ads.
Anyone bemused by why their newsfeed is serving up cures for baldness when they have a full head of hair or miracle diets when they are stick-thin will be pleased to hear that Facebook is working to make ads more relevant.
""Facebook is often criticised for how much customer data it mines but actually it isn't doing it very effectively,"" said Ms Zoller.
""The targeting simply isn't very good.""
And as Facebook plans even more mobile advertising, it absolutely needs to make a much better job of it if it, she thinks.
""Mobile adverts have the potential to be incredibly intrusive unless they are very well targeted,"" she said.
Among all the surveys speculating about Facebook's future, there is surprisingly little analysis about why people keep using it.
In a recent status update, Facebook's communication manager and former BBC tech desk editor Iain Mackenzie summed up why he thought it endures.
""Today people have shared the birth of their first child, wedding, hooked up, broke up, mourned, outed themselves, said something dumb, said something profound, confessed that life's got too hard for them, been brought back from the brink by a friend, or a stranger, found a job, posted something that lost them their job, learned a fact that will save their life one day, found their new favourite song, and hit 'like' on a cat picture - all on Facebook.""
Its appeal could boil down to the fact that it taps into that most basic of human characteristics - curiosity.
Whether we like it or not, Facebook has become the digital novel of people's lives. And for many, it remains essential reading.",The candles on Facebook's 10th birthday cake will barely have been blown out before someone somewhere starts speculating on whether it will ever make 11.
"McDowell has dropped to 89th in the world rankings and as is stands, is not in the field for the Masters or the WGC Match Play in Mexico in early March.
""The Masters is not something I'm going to beat myself up about,"" said the 2010 US Open champion, who is now 37.
""If come Bay Hill (mid-March) I'm not in, I'm not going to add more events.""
However, McDowell believes with him playing in Qatar and Dubai on the European Tour and the Genesis Open and Honda Classic in America over the coming five weeks, he is capable of putting himself in contention to earn spots at the World Match Play and Augusta.
""I'm more motivated than I have been for a while. I still have the belief that my good is good enough (to compete at the very top). I have just got to work hard and get out and be calm and believe in myself,"" added McDowell, who missed out on a fifth Ryder Cup appearance last year.
McDowell says his watchword in the early weeks of the season will be ""patience"" as he focuses on the whole campaign rather an obsession with ensuring a ninth Masters appearance.
""World ranking is very important but it's a step by step process. Getting back in the top 50 is goal number one and then back into the top 25 and competing in all the major championships.
""How long is the road going to be? It could be a long road or a short road but I'm going to be patient with it.
""The Masters is not going to be the be all and end all for me as my record around Augusta is not great.
""Things like the World Match Play and getting ready for the British Open are also on my radar.""
McDowell did achieve five top-10 finishes in 2016 but he admits he ""struggled for consistency"" for much of the season.
""I felt like when I played well, I did play well and posted some decent finishes but I was inconsistent and missed a lot of cuts.""
The Northern Irishman accepts that becoming a father for the second time during the year may have allowed his focus to drift away from his golf.
""Getting married and having children are big steps in life. You never really understand what they are going to do to you from a priorities points of view, a mental point of view and a desire to play golf point of view.
""I think they affected me more than I thought they were going to but I wouldn't change anything for the world. I've got two very healthy and beautiful young kids at home and I'm enjoying that stage of my life.""",Graeme McDowell says he will not frantically chase a spot at this year's Masters as he prepares to begin his season at this week's Qatar Masters.
"The Dung Beetle UK Mapping Project (Dump) is still in the early stages of its research work, which has included examining beetle sites in Scotland.
However, the team said it had already noted an ""alarming trend"" of decline of some species.
Dung beetles play key roles in improving soils and controlling pests.
Reasons for the decline in some beetle species include coming into contact with anthelmintics, a type of drug given to livestock to control intestinal worms that prevent the farm animals from thriving.
Dump involves Darren Mann, who is head of life collections at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, Steve Lane, Ceri Watkins and Sally-Ann Spence.
The project is not funded and the team members have been doing their research in their spare time, while on family holidays and fitting it around their other work.
The scientists have been examining well-documented dung beetle sites, including locations in the Cairngorms, and have also been looking for the insects in previously unrecorded places.
They hope to enlist the help of organisations that record flora and fauna and also wildlife enthusiasts, whose attention is being drawn to Dump via social media. On Twitter the project has the hashtags #dungathon and #dungisfun.
Ms Spence said some of Dump's early results had given cause for concern.
She said: ""Our results mapping the dung beetle species in the UK, although the project is in its youth, are already showing an alarming trend in species rarity and even extinction.
""The three main reasons behind this are considered to be the use of anthelmintics, soil disturbance and the disappearance of livestock from historic pastures due to a change in farming practices.""
It has been suggested that dung beetles save the UK's cattle industry an estimated Â£367m a year, Ms Spence said.
They do this by encouraging the growth of healthy grass through their burrowing in soil, which aerates it and allows rainwater and nutrients into the ground.
Dung beetles also eat animal droppings harbouring parasites harmful to livestock.
Ms Spence said: ""We take the opportunity of our survey visits to make farmers and livestock keepers aware of their dung beetles, the latest research, their economic benefits and how they might implement simple workable measures ensure a healthy dung beetle population.
""We have received a fantastically positive response from all we have spoken to.
""Farmers are keen to preserve their dung beetles and we intend to gather more data about species and their population frequencies to enable more research into these incredibly important beetles.""
As well as their importance to agriculture, the beetles and their grubs are food for wild birds and mammals.
Scotland has the UK strongholds for at least three species of dung beetle - Aphodius fasciatus, Aphodius lapponum and Aphodius nemoralis.
The Cairngorms and the Western Isles are among the best recorded areas for the creatures, but large parts of the rest of Scotland remain unrecorded.
Ms Spence said: ""The project is vast.
""Different species live in, or under, different dung in different stages of decomposition on different soils at different altitudes at different times of the year.
""Dung quality is important too. We have become connoisseurs of fine dung. Not adverse to feeling the texture or giving it a good sniff - you can tell a lot about an animals health by its dung - we will examine it meticulously for beetles.""
The end result will be a dataset of dung beetle information, including identification, distribution maps, ecology and species conservation status. This will be made available via The British Beetles website and will include an online recording system using Irecord.","Some of the UK's dung beetle species are becoming scarcer and could even face extinction, according to scientists."
"Paisley-born singer Nutini will be the top act for the Concert in the Gardens, his only festival performance in 2016, while the indie favourites will headline the Waverley Stage.

Increased stewarding and security will mean higher prices for some events including the Torchlight procession.
Nutini said: ""When they offered us the gig, I was made up, as it was 10 years ago that we had shown up at the castle, lined up to play alongside the Pet Shop Boys and unfortunately it was a washout ... forcing the powers-that-be to cancel.
""We went back as a three-piece in '08 to play a small set before legging it to Glasgow for George Square, but this now gives us a chance to make up for lost gigs.

The event will be rounded off with a fireworks display from the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle.
Edinburgh's Hogmanay, described as the UK's largest outdoor winter music festival, has been produced by Unique Events on behalf of the City of Edinburgh Council since 1993.
It is expected to bring in 150,000 visitors from more than 80 countries across three days of celebrations, giving the city an estimated Â£40m boost.
Other events confirmed include the annual torchlight procession on 30 December, the ""Loony Dook"" dip in the Forth at South Queensferry, the Scot:Lands festival of music, art and theatre on 1 January and the Final Fling closing ceilidh, also on New Year's Day.

"She inherited the East Londonderry seat from David McClarty after his untimely death from cancer, following in his footsteps as a liberal unionist working hard on the bread and butter concerns of her constituents.
She was perhaps best known for a speech during last year's Stormont crisis, in which she pronounced that the House of Cards was falling down and hoped the ""jokers at the top"" would never get back up.
Having secured a seat via the assembly's co-option system, some whispered that Ms Sugden wouldn't survive her first election. But she proved the doubters wrong, getting 3.270 first preference votes and ensuring the Ulster Unionist party didn't make a comeback.
It might have been assumed that she would dedicate herself to consolidating her position as a grassroots politician, and when the Ulster Unionists announced they were going into opposition, she spoke approvingly of the move.
But then Alliance decided to dig their heels in around a demand for reforms to Stormont's controversial petition of concern vetoes, and the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in started to look in a different direction for a justice minister.
In contrast to Alliance, Ms Sugden did not present Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness with a five-point wish list.
Sitting in her new ministerial office, she told me she didn't think that was appropriate.
Instead, she hopes to achieve change incrementally by building relationships with her new executive colleagues.
For example, she wants Stormont politicians to have an ""open and fair discussion"" about the fact that Northern Ireland women are still travelling to Great Britain to have abortions, and hopes to achieve ""some constructive change"".
Similarly on same sex marriage, I asked if she would now bear some responsibility if the DUP vetoes another Assembly motion, given that Alliance had been looking for such vetoes to be radically restricted.
Ms Sugden acknowledges she would be disappointed, but again believes that a ""subtle approach"" is more likely to pay dividends. She promises to have conversations with her executive colleagues ""behind closed doors"" in an effort to get them to change their minds on the issue.
She knows there may be occasions on which the two big parties are tempted to overrule her. But she says that if they do so, it will impact on them as she was their nominee for the job, and she vows not to be a ""sitting duck"" for either the DUP or Sinn FÃ©in.
It's no secret the last few days have been very difficult ones for the 29-year-old MLA.
Not only has she faced a political dilemma, but her family has been dealing with the trauma of a motorcycle accident which left her brother-in-law very seriously injured.
As the daughter of a prison officer, she knows about the need to take security precautions, but she describes the inevitable risks of taking the justice post as ""life changing"".
Ms Sugden describes the last week as perhaps the toughest of her life. But flicking through her ""first day brief"", she hopes to move forward on a more positive note.","Until the Assembly broke for the election campaign, Claire Sugden was an occupant of what used to be called the ""naughty corner""."

Police have asked anyone with information to contact them.
The suspect is described as white, about 5ft 7in tall, with a medium build.
At the time of the robbery, he was wearing a dark hooded jacket and dark trousers. He was also wearing a balaclava to disguise his face and he had a local accent.
Officers will be carrying out door-to-door inquiries and gathering CCTV images from the local area.
Det Con Emma McLaughlin, of Police Scotland, said: ""There are other stores, such as a takeaway and a local shop nearby and it's possible someone may have seen the man before the incident, perhaps he was loitering outside, maybe you saw him acting a little suspiciously.

"NTS said four chicks had hatched from one nest at the Mar Lodge Estate.
One male chick has been satellite tagged as part of the RSPB's Hen Harrier Life project.
The species was pushed to the brink of extinction by the early 1900s. Numbers recovered but there are still only about 500 breeding pairs in Scotland.
The large raptors are found mainly in moorland areas.
Mar Lodge Estate property manager David Frew said: ""It is fantastic news and really exciting to see these birds returning to the estate for the first time in living memory.
""We have worked hard to create an environment where raptors can thrive, and it is great to see that our approach to management is paying off.""
Will Boyd-Wallis, from the Cairngorms National Park Authority, said: ""We very much hope that the careful management undertaken by the National Trust for Scotland alongside other estates in the East Cairngorms Moorland Partnership and in the wider National Park will lead to many more pairs successfully returning to the area.""

She added: ""National surveys show a 20% decline in just six years between 2004 and 2010 and east Scotland in particular has seen only a handful of successful breeding attempts in recent years.

""The problem is if you're not getting the games and then if you're not quite on it in training then you're losing fitness.
""But then the moment you're asked to come in and get up to speed in a real high-tempo, intense game, the moments that are there for you to risk injury are far greater.""
Rodgers named Dedryck Boyata and Callum McGregor as examples of players who have shown great professionalism to work hard and force their way into his plans.
""You have to work tirelessly every day or unfortunately you'll get left behind,"" he said.
Rodgers echoed the words of his predecessor, Ronny Deila, who spoke of the need to be a ""24-hour athlete"".
""It's a difficult period for him with that injury,"" the Celtic manager said of Griffiths, who has lost his place to summer signing Moussa Dembele.
""But the only way you can overcome that is by working 24 hours a day for your profession, for your life.
""He's a good kid, a great boy, but he understands where he's at. We all know the talent, but it won't be good enough on its own.
""We speak a lot and it's not easy because he hasn't played maybe as much as he did last year. The reasons are simple for that.
""He's a player I really admire, a player we really want to have here.
""He's part of the squad, but I want him fit and available. He knows that and it's something he's working harder now to try to achieve.""",Brendan Rodgers has urged Leigh Griffiths to work harder if he is to force his way back into Celtic's team.
"The Sahara chief was arrested on Friday after he failed to appear before the judges in connection with a fraud case.
Two Sahara firms were ordered to repay 240bn rupees ($3.9bn; Â£2.3bn) to investors that market regulators said they had raised illegally.
On Tuesday, a protester threw ink on Mr Roy's face as he arrived at the court.
""Subrata Roy is a thief. He has cheated and robbed us,"" his attacker shouted. The man, identified as a lawyer by Indian television channels, was taken away by the police.
Profile: Subrata Roy
It was not immediately clear whether the businessman would now be sent to jail. Since his arrest, he has been lodged in government guest houses.
The Supreme Court set the next hearing for 11 March.
On Tuesday, Mr Roy apologised to the court saying his reasons for not appearing before the judges last Wednesday ""were genuine"".
He said Sahara would sell its assets and pay back the investors and asked the judges to give him more time.
But the court rejected his proposal saying ""we are not interested in selling the properties, you have been telling us for the last two years, it is your headache, you should have done it"".
The judges also ordered police to take two other Sahara directors into custody and hold them until the next hearing.
The case against Mr Roy stretches back to August 2012, when the court ordered the two Sahara firms implicated to refund money to 22 million small investors within 90 days and with 15% interest.
In December 2012, the court gave the firms more time to repay.
In February last year, market regulators  froze the firms' bank accounts saying they had failed to refund the money.
But Sahara disputes the amount it should pay back, saying its liability should be no more than the 51.2bn rupees it has already paid back.
Mr Roy is a household name in India.
His group, worth $11bn, has businesses ranging from finance, housing and manufacturing to aviation and the media.
It also has interests overseas - it owns New York's landmark Plaza Hotel and London's iconic Grosvenor House.
Sahara also sponsors the Indian hockey team and owns a stake in Formula One racing team, Force India.
With more than 1.1 million workers, the group is India's biggest private sector employer.",India's Supreme Court has ordered the continuing detention of businessman Subrata Roy and asked his firm to come up with a plan to repay its investors.

"No longer, of course, after the bloody and brutal end of a quarter a century of civil war.
When the prime minister arrived here in Jaffna to visit a public library that is seen as the cultural heart of the Tamil community, he was greeted by two rival demonstrations.
On one side of the road, there was a group of clearly pro-regime demonstrators who, amusingly, carried almost identical printed signs written in English.
When I approached this group I could not find a single one of them who spoke English.
They were calling for an inquiry - not into the crimes of the civil war, or the alleged war crimes of their own president, but into colonial abuses, Britain's behaviour here many decades ago.
Their rival group, composed largely of women, was equally well-organised. As the prime minister arrived they rushed forward to try to see him and were held back by police.
They were carrying in their hands identically laminated pictures of their loved ones, the so-called disappeared - sons, daughters, mothers and fathers who went missing during the civil war.
The prime minister is walking a tightrope on this trip. When he returns from meeting Tamil leaders in the north he will go back to the Commonwealth summit, in the capital Colombo - a summit boycotted by Canadian, Indian and Mauritian leaders - for a face-to-face meeting with the Sri Lankan president.
Mr Cameron has said there are sufficient allegations of war crimes - and ongoing human rights abuses - against President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his government to warrant international inquiries.
He says he is shining a light on what is happening in this country - and that there is some value in diplomacy. In not merely boycotting what is going on.
As his entourage was leaving the public library, a group of screaming women - desperate to make their representations directly to the first world leader to come here - pressed photographs and petitions into our hands.
One of them was thrown to the floor as she tried to get to the prime minister's convoy.
Mr Cameron has certainly been made aware of the human price of a bloody civil war.","David Cameron has just landed in Northern Sri Lanka, becoming the first prime minister, the first world leader, to travel to the north of this island, once controlled by the Tamil Tigers."
"Members of the National Union of Teachers (NUT) said it was to highlight wider problems including teacher redundancies.
Powys council's cabinet member for schools, Arwel Jones, said he was ""surprised and disappointed"".
The NUT said it represented about half of teachers in Powys and 83.5% of those balloted voted in favour of action.
The council is currently consulting on plans to reorganise secondary schools.
Mr Jones added: ""Strike action will not deflect our programme but could disrupt the work of school pupils at a crucial time.""","Teachers in Powys are set to go on strike on Thursday in protest over ""excessive workload and cuts""."
"Students from 12,000 schools nationwide will be told not to do their weekend homework for the month of November.
The Spanish Alliance of Parents' Associations (CEAPA), which called the strike, argues that homework is detrimental to children.
Spain was high up on a homework league table in a 2012 education report.
The PISA study, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, found that Spanish children and teenagers have 6.5 hours of homework a week, compared with an average of 4.9 from a group of 38 countries.
Spain ranked 11th on a list of 64 countries or locations in a PISA table covering the amount of homework given.
The workload does not necessarily translate in better results for Spanish students - they have traditionally scored low results in maths, reading and science in other PISA reports.
By contrast, in Finland and South Korea, two of the countries with the best student performances according to PISA - the average time spent on homework every week was less than three hours.
So what does this say about the learning methods used in Spain?
CEAPA president Jose Luis Pazos says education in Spain has been very reliant on the traditional method of rote-learning - memorising work.
He stresses that what children have to learn is how to manage information and how to decide what to memorise and what not.
""Society has changed deeply, but the environment in the classroom hasn't,"" he says.
The homework debate has been raging in other countries too, and it is not just parents who are concerned.
In the US state of Texas, a secondary school teacher near Dallas sent a letter to parents telling them that she will not be assigning homework to students this year. Instead, she said she wanted them to spend more time with their families.
A high school in Britain scrapped traditional homework at the start of term in favour of a more ""independent"" approach to learning.
And even in South Korea, the authorities are considering reducing homework for younger pupils even further. The Yonhap news agency reported in August that the city education office in Seoul was banning primary schools from giving homework to lower grade students, starting next year.",Thousands of parents in Spain are going on strike against state schools this weekend over the large amount of homework given to their children.

"The app was designed to enable doctors to share pictures of their patients, both with each other and with medical students.
So far, more than 150,000 doctors have uploaded case photos with the patient's identity obscured.
However, some experts have expressed concern about patient confidentiality.
Patients' faces are automatically obscured by the app but users must manually block identifying marks like tattoos.
Each photo is reviewed by moderators before it is added to the database.
Founder Dr Josh Landy told the BBC that the Figure 1 service did not access any patient records.
""We do not possess any personal medical data at all. The best way to keep a secret is not to have it. We are not an organisation that delivers healthcare,"" he told the BBC.
But doctors must provide identifying credentials and are also advised to notify their employees and patients to find out about consent policies.
""Legally, we found that identifying the doctor does not identify the patient,"" said Dr Landy.
""However some [medical] conditions are so rare that they can't be posted. One user wanted to post something but there are only seven cases of it in the US and they had all been reportable because they are rare, so the patient could have been identified.""
Anybody can download the app for free, but only verified healthcare professionals can upload photos or comment on them, he added.
""We reject sensationalistic images,"" said Dr Landy.
""Everything is there for educational purposes. That said, there are very colourful images - things medics see every day. It's a transparent view into a world you rarely get to see.""
The app is already available in North America, the UK and Ireland.
While digital services such as UpToDate and DynaMed - both requiring a subscription - are already widely used within the healthcare community as clinical knowledge databases, they are not rivals to Figure 1, said Dr Landy.
""UpToDate is an app I love, and have used for years. However, they have a highly curated repository of articles written and edited by experts in the field.
""What our app does is provide the opportunity to contribute any case no matter how classic or unusual. Ours is all image-based and totally crowdsourced.""
The app has received $6m (Â£3.75m) in investment in the last year.
British GP and author Dr Ellie Cannon gave it a cautious welcome.
""I think it's potentially really useful to share photos with medical students and other doctors,"" she said.
""Obviously the potential pitfall is the confidentiality. Of course, they are anonymised but even uploading from a certain doctor may go some way to identify a patient,"" she added.
""And can a patient later opt out? We've seen with other sites the downsides of sharing too much.""",An app which enables healthcare professionals to share photos is to be rolled out across western Europe by the end of the year.

Annagh lie bottom of their league, having shipped 12 goals in three games.
Glentoran manager Kernaghan had gone into the game under a degree of pressure after a section of Glens supporters had voiced their discontent following a 4-1 league reverse at Coleraine on Saturday.
Gardiner completed a fine breakaway by chipping Elliott Morris for the opener in the 19th minute and the County Armagh side had their illustrious visitors in real trouble when Campbell added the second.
Caldwell's deflected 25-yard effort three minutes later gave the Glens hope, but that optimism proved short-lived when Park made it 3-1, Novo, Glentoran skipper for the evening, pulling one back from six yards out on 85 minutes.
""The first goal was important for us, it gave us a real lift, and hopefully this result will kick-start our season. We fear nobody,"" Annagh manager Paul Matchet told BBC Radio Ulster's Sportsound programme after the game.

Currie's anticipated appointment was confirmed at Shamrock Park on Monday evening as his five-year stint as Ards manager came to an end.
The Portadown native, 44, emerged as the club's preferred candidate over the past week.
Currie, who has been handed an 18-month contract, takes over a side that are 13 points adrift at the bottom of the Premiership table.
Portadown started the season with a 12-point deduction for making irregular payments to players and were also handed a number of fines, in addition to being prevented from signing players on professional deals this season.
Despite the team's predicament, the new manager described his appointment as the ""pinnacle for me"".
""I was in a strong position and a secure job at Ards, but my heart led me here. The lure of coming home and managing my hometown club was too strong,"" said Currie at the news conference confirming his appointment.
""We're going through a tough time at the moment but I want to bring a smile back to this club.
""Our first priority is doing our utmost to stay in the league and we want to give it a real rattle.""
Currie has arrived from Ards with long-term assistant Jay Willis while Trevor Williamson will remain part of the backroom team.
One of the new manager's first acts has been to recall former Linfield striker Mark McAllister to the first-team squad.
Back in September, then manager Pat McGibbon told McAllister that he was no longer part of the club's plans.
However, Currie believes the striker can be an asset to the squad.
""He's looking forward to playing and getting himself fit,"" said the new manager.
""We've got some good defenders and some good midfielders but I think we need to inject a bit of pace into the last third of the pitch.""
A statement from Ards on Monday night said that the North Down club had received ""an amount of compensation from Portadown for Currie's services"" but that there would be ""further discussions between the two clubs"".
The Ards statement added that first-team coach John Bailie will act as their caretaker manager as the club decides how to go about appointing a successor to Currie.
Vinny Arkins stepped aside as interim Ports boss last Thursday, having been in caretaker charge of the crisis club since previous manager McGibbon resigned in mid October.
Arkins was not in contention to succeed McGibbon as he does not hold a Uefa A coaching licence.

"In a statement, the Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service (NIFRS) said it was an ""exceptionally busy"" night.
Crews stopped a bonfire spreading to an apartment block near Belfast's Sandy Row, but the heat cracked its windows.
Bonfires are traditionally lit in loyalist areas on 11 July, marking the Twelfth of July commemorations.
Between 18:00 BST on Tuesday and 01:00 BST on Wednesday, NIFRS dealt with a total of 213 emergency calls.
During its busiest period, its regional control centre handled one 999 call every minute.
Assistant chief fire officer Alan Walmsley told BBC Radio Ulster that the two most serious bonfire-related incidents were both in Belfast.
They were at Wellwood Street, off Sandy Row, and at the Bloomfield Walk/Ravenscroft Avenue site in the east of the city.
Mr Walmsley said glazing was badly damaged when the Sandy Row bonfire came ""very close"" to a ten-storey apartment block in Wellwood Street.
A number of residents who were inside the Victoria Place flats at the time called the fire service amid fears about the heat of the bonfire.
""All the glazing [on the apartment block] facing the bonfire has been damaged and cracked,"" said Mr Walmsley.
""If our crews had not been on the scene working so hard, there is no doubt that fire would have spread into that building.""
Lucy Ryan was inside the apartment complex at the time.
She told BBC News NI: ""We were standing on the first floor, looking out onto the bonfire and saw it all collapse.
""Obviously we felt the heat and we saw the fire was literally coming right over to the building, so we were like 'right, we have to get out'.
""We just left down the stairwell and as we were leaving to get out, that's where we saw all the windows were cracked.""
Earlier this week, Belfast City Council withheld funding earmarked for a children's street party in Sandy Row, reportedly over concerns about the height of the bonfire.
On Wednesday morning, part of Wellwood Street was closed due to safety concerns over the damaged building.
The Trafficwatch Northern Ireland service said a lane closure ""is likely to be in place in the street for a number of days between Great Victoria Street and Sandy Row"".
Overall, firefighters were deployed to a total of 133 incidents overnight, which was a rise of nearly 50% on the same period in 2016.
Despite this, the fire service said it ""maintained normal service delivery throughout the evening, attending a range of operational incidents including property fires, special service calls and other emergency incidents"".
Mr Walmsley said: ""Our crews worked extremely hard last night in extremely punishing conditions and I would just like to place on record my thanks to them.""
He said two fire crews were attacked as they left the scene of a bonfires in Belfast and Larne, County Antrim.
""After working so hard at Wellwood Street for a number of hours to protect properties, as our crews were leaving one of our appliances came under attack by local youths.
""The same situation happened in Larne where our crews worked extremely hard at a bonfire protecting local properties and again when they were leaving they came under attack.""
No injuries have been reported. The assistant chief fire officer said he was disappointed at what were the first attacks on firefighters during Eleventh Night bonfires for five years.
Meanwhile, police have said they are investigating complaints about ""distasteful"" materials placed on some bonfires.
Sinn FÃ©in's national chairperson Declan Kearney called on unionist politicians to condemn ""hatemongers"" who put a replica coffin bearing the image of Martin McGuinness, who died in March, on a bonfire in east Belfast.
""I am directly challenging the leaders of all unionist parties to immediately disassociate themselves and their parties from this and other examples of sectarian hate crime,"" he said.
Images also emerged on social media of a bonfire in east Belfast draped with a banner carrying a racist message directed at Celtic footballer Scott Sinclair.
In a statement, the PSNI said: ""We take hate crime very seriously and actively investigate all incidents reported to us.""
However, many bonfires were held across Northern Ireland without incident on the Eleventh Night.
The annual loyalist tradition of bonfires and parades commemorates the victory of the Dutch-born William III over the Catholic forces of King James II at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.","Firefighters responded to 40 bonfire-related incidents across Northern Ireland overnight, an increase of 21% on the Eleventh Night last year."
"Russia's Investigative Committee, modelled on the FBI,  will question the activists. Six Britons are among them.
Their ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is being towed to the port of Murmansk.
Committee spokesman Vladimir Markin said ""all those who assaulted the platform, regardless of nationality, will be prosecuted"".
The campaigners were detained on Thursday along with their ship after two Greenpeace activists tried to climb onto a Gazprom offshore platform, in a protest against oil drilling in the Arctic.
The ship was raided by armed Russian men in balaclavas who abseiled down from helicopters. The ship was seized in the Pechora Sea, near the rig.
Greenpeace said the Russian authorities ""are holding 30 of our activists"".
In a statement on Tuesday, Greenpeace said its ship had arrived in a fjord near Murmansk accompanied by a tug boat and the Russian Coast Guard vessel Ladoga.
""Greenpeace International lawyers are demanding immediate access to the 30 activists who have been held for over four days without legal or consular assistance. It is still not known whether Russia intends to lay formal charges and Greenpeace has not received any formal contact from the authorities,"" it said.
The environmental organisation said its protest against ""dangerous Arctic oil drilling"" was peaceful and in line with its ""strong principles"".
""Our activists did nothing to warrant the reaction we've seen from the Russian authorities,"" it said.
The campaigners on the ship are from 18 countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, New Zealand, Russia, the UK and the US, Greenpeace said.
Mr Markin described the protest as ""an attempt to seize a drilling platform by storm"" and said it raised ""legitimate doubts about their intentions"". The ship ""was loaded with electronics whose purpose was not clear"", he said.
""It's hard to believe that the so-called activists did not know that the platform is an installation with a high hazard level, and any unauthorised actions on it can lead to an accident, which would not only endanger the people aboard it but also the ecology, which is being protected zealously,"" he said.
Article 227 of Russia's penal code defines piracy as ""an attack on a ship at sea or on a river, with the aim of seizing someone else's property, using violence or the threat of violence"". It can be punished with a jail term of up to 15 years, depending on the gravity of the offence, and a fine of up to 500,000 roubles (Â£10,000; $15,000).
Commenting on the Arctic campaigners, a Greenpeace spokesman said that ""as far as we are aware they are in fairly good spirits and no-one has been ill-treated"".
A British campaigner, Alex Harris, has texted her parents from the ship, saying she is ""safe"". ""Will call when I can. Individuals have not been charged. Just the ship,"" she added in the message.
Earlier Sue Turner, mother of British campaigner Iain Rogers from Exeter in Devon, said: ""I've been told they are being treated well by the Russians - I am very relieved"".
Anthony Perrett, another British Greenpeace activist on the ship, spoke to his partner Zaharah Ally via a consulate telephone.
Ms Ally, from Newport in south Wales, said he told her that they were not allowed to leave the ship.
""However, they are allowed to move around the ship and conduct their daily lives,"" she told the BBC. ""Anthony is a very positive person and sounded very well. He did say he would possibly be on the ship for five days.""",Russian prosecutors have accused 30 Greenpeace activists of piracy and say they will prosecute all of them for trying to board an Arctic oil platform.
"Despite stringent carbon emissions targets in Europe designed to slow global warming and massive investment in renewable energy in China, demand for this most ancient source of energy is greater than ever.
In fact, coal was the fastest growing form of energy in the world outside renewables last year, with production up 6% on 2010, twice the rate of increase of gas and more than four times that of oil. Consumption data paints a similar picture, while figures for this year are set to tell the same story.
There are a number of drivers behind coal's renaissance, many of which may be short lived. Others will push demand ever higher for decades to come.
Coal consumption in Europe, where governments have been at the forefront of the push to curb carbon dioxide emissions, has risen sharply in recent years.
Why? Because it's cheap, and getting cheaper all the time. Due to the economic downturn, there has been what Paul McConnell, senior analyst at energy research group Wood Mackenzie, calls a ""collapse in industrial demand for energy"". This has led to an oversupply of coal, pushing the price down.
It has also led to a massive surfeit of CO2 emissions permits, pushing the price of carbon, and therefore the cost of coal production, sharply lower.
Equally important, there has been a huge influx of cheap coal from the US, where the discovery of shale gas has provided an even cheaper alternative energy source. The coal has to go somewhere, so it's exported to Europe.
Finally, higher non-shale, natural gas prices are making coal an attractive alternative.
As Laszlo Varro, head of gas, coal and power markets at the International Energy Agency (IEA), says: ""All parameters favour coal.""
So much so that ""coal is [now] being burned as the baseload fuel across most of Europe,"" says Gareth Carpenter, associate editor at global energy information provider Platts.
Germany's decision to scrap all nuclear power and build more coal-fired power stations can only boost production further.
Just how long coal's resurgence lasts depends to some extent on the global economic recovery and the ability of governments to implement a system that finally delivers a meaningful carbon price.
But, in the meantime, legislation passed more than a decade ago will severely curb coal production over the coming years, according to Mr Varro.
The full impact of the EU's Large Combustion Plant Directive, which is designed to reduce local air pollutants, but not in fact carbon dioxide, is about to be felt, meaning a number of inefficient coal plants will be decommissioned.
As a result, in five years, coal production capacity ""will be considerably lower than today"", says Mr Varro. The directive will do nothing, of course, to restrict cheap US imports.
But whatever happens to coal production and consumption in Europe, spiralling demand for energy in Asia, in particular China, will ensure that coal production continues to rise significantly over the coming decades.
Source: BP. Reserves calculated at current price using current technologies
Population growth and the exploding middle classes will see to that - in China alone, demand for energy will triple by 2030, according to Wood Mackenzie.
China in particular is spending massive amounts of money on a renewable energy drive the likes of which the world has never seen - plans are in place to build almost 10 times the wind capacity of Germany, for example.
But even this will not be able to keep up with demand, meaning fossil fuels will continue to make up the majority of the overall energy mix for the foreseeable future.
And when it comes to fossil fuels, coal is the easy winner - it is generally easier and cheaper to mine, and easier to transport using existing infrastructure such as roads and rail, than oil or gas.
Its price is also relatively stable because, as Mr Carpenter points out: ""Coal mines on the whole are located in relatively stable countries free from major geopolitical tensions.""
For all these reasons, Wood Mackenzie forecasts coal production in Indonesia, currently the world's fourth-biggest coal producer, to rise by 60% by 2020, while China will import more than a billion tonnes by 2030, almost five times currents levels.
By this date, it expects global demand for imported coal to more than double, helping to push the fossil fuel's proportion of the overall energy mix even higher than it is today.
Cheap energy is, of course, a vital ingredient in the continued economic growth of developing countries, but the implications of rising coal production for CO2 emissions and global warming are profound.
While China is currently running half a dozen carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects - which aim to capture CO2 emissions from coal plants and bury it underground - the technology is nowhere near commercial viability.
As Mr Carpenter says, despite all the hype ""it looks extremely unlikely that CCS technology is going to be deployed widely in the next 10 years or so"".
The inevitable end result is rising CO2 emissions. According to the IEA, emissions from fossil fuels hit a record level last year, while total energy-related emissions and are due to rise by more than 20% by 2035.
""Why we aren't developing CCS for all we're worth is a mystery to me,"" says Prof Myles Allen at the school of geography and the environment at the University of Oxford.
""It is viewed as just one of a basket of solutions, but it's not - it's pivotal. Without it, nothing else follows.""
And CCS lends itself perfectly to coal, precisely because it is such a cheap energy source.
Renewed urgency in developing CCS globally, alongside greater strides in increasing renewable energy capacity, is desperately needed, but Europe's increasing reliance on coal without capturing emissions is undermining its status as a leader in clean energy, and therefore global efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.","Coal, the dirtiest and most polluting of all the major fossil fuels, is making a comeback."
"Olivier Ntcham's first-half goal proved decisive as Kris Doolan headed over a glorious chance before Nir Bitton appeared to clip Miles Storey late on.
""It's a foul anywhere else on the pitch,"" said Archibald. ""It's a big call in the last minute against Celtic.
""You don't often get them. We had one in midweek, we usually get one a year so we're not getting two in four days.""
Celtic dominated possession but lacked a finishing touch with Leigh Griffiths starting on the bench and Moussa Dembele still missing.
Despite debuts for Conor Sammon and Miles Storey, signed from Hearts - on loan - and Aberdeen respectively, Thistle carried little threat until a late rally.
""We had one good chance [Doolan's] and the late penalty shout,"" Archibald told BBC Scotland. ""We worked ever so hard, it's not easy to contain them.
""I know it's frustrating for our fans that we didn't come out and have a real go but you saw at the end there when we went with two strikers and they can quickly turn you over.""
Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers believes referee Andrew Dallas was in a good position to make the penalty call, and felt his side deserved to claim all three points.
""I'd need to see it again,"" said Rodgers. ""It looked from where I was that Nir (Bitton) got a toe to it, and he was the right side of the defender.
""The pitch was maybe a bit slippy at that stage which is perhaps why the boy went down, but the ref was in a great position and he didn't give it.
""We will play better, of course - we were outstanding in the week [the 5-0 win over Kilmarnock] - but tonight is a game we will look back on at the end of the season and hopefully say it was an important three points.
""We could have been more comfortable in the game if we had put our chances away, but when it is still 1-0 you have to defend, and I thought the players were comfortable even though there was bit of pressure around our 18-yard box.
""We didn't quite perform as well as I would want - our standards are much higher than we showed - but it shows the resilience and mentality in the team to get the result tonight.
""That's maybe one of the games we would have drawn last season. So it's good the players can now see out games.""
Rodgers revealed he could sign a new striker before the Champions League play-off first-leg tie against Astana on Wednesday.
Griffiths could only start as a substitute due to ongoing calf concerns, while French striker Dembele is out until September with a knee injury.
The Celtic manager said: ""James (Forrest) is doing great playing in there, Tom Rogic has played up there and done brilliant for us but the dynamic of the team is better when you have a number nine who can play the role.
""It is really about the availability of a player.
""We will look to bring in quality if available. Maybe (next week). It is something that we have been working towards in the last few weeks, so there may be something happening.""",Partick Thistle boss Alan Archibald felt his side should have been given a penalty in their 1-0 defeat by Celtic.
"Philando Castile was shot in his car in St Paul, Minnesota, on Wednesday as he reached for his driving licence, his girlfriend said in a Facebook Live video taken during the aftermath.
His death follows that of Alton Sterling, who was shot dead by police during an incident in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Tuesday.
What do we know about the two victims?
The 32-year-old had worked in the canteen of a school in St Paul for more than 10 years, his uncle Clarence told media in Minnesota. The JJ Hill Montessori Magnet School in the city listed Mr Castile as a cafeteria supervisor on its website.
On his Facebook page, Clarence later re-posted comments by a Minnesota bishop, Divar Kemp, calling Philando Castile ""an a1 genuine man who was killed because he obeyed what the officer asked him"".
Mr Castile's cousin, Antonio Johnson, told the Star Tribune newspaper his cousin had graduated with honours from St Paul Central High School.
Mr Castile was ""a black individual driving in Falcon Heights who was immediately criminally profiled and he lost his life over it tonight"", he said.
He added that Mr Castile was ""very non-confrontational"" and ""a real upstanding citizen"".
The Star Tribune said Mr Castile had only minor offences on his criminal record.
Little is publicly known about Mr Sterling, 37.
The father of five sold CDs and DVDs in the car park in which he died, family members told media in Louisiana.
""If you asked Alton for the shirt off his back, he'd give it to you,"" his aunt, Lorna, told The Advocate newspaper. ""Alton would give you the world.""
One broadcaster, 9News, said Mr Sterling had a long criminal record, that included several battery, drug, and burglary charges. It said he was also arrested in 2009 for resisting an officer and illegally carrying a weapon.
But Lorna Sterling said her brother had sought to earn a living after his last conviction in 2011.","Two black men have been shot dead by police in the US this week, the latest in a line of similar incidents, many of which have led to protests."

"The males of the extraordinary semi-aquatic mammal - one of the only kind to lay eggs - have venomous spurs on the heels of their hind feet.
The poison is used to ward off adversaries.
But scientists at the University of Adelaide and Flinders University have discovered it contains a hormone that could help treat diabetes.
Known as GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), it is also found in humans and other animals, where it promotes insulin release, lowering blood glucose levels. But it normally degrades very quickly.
Not for the duck-billed bottom feeders though. Or for echidnas, also known as spiny anteaters - another iconic Australian species found to carry the unusual hormone.
Both produce a long-lasting form of it, offering the tantalising prospect of creating something similar for human diabetes sufferers.
Lead researcher Prof Frank Grutzer told the BBC's Greg Dunlop why the researchers had decided to look at the platypus and its insulin mechanisms: ""We knew from genome analysis that there was something weird about the platypus's metabolic control system because they basically lack a functional stomach.""
They are not the only animals to use insulin against enemies. The gila monster, a venomous lizard native to the US and Mexico, and the geographer cone, a dangerous sea snail which can kill entire schools of fish by releasing insulin into the sea, both also weaponise the chemical.
""That's obviously something that can be powerful in venom,"" Prof Grutzer said, though he stressed it was not what had led them to the discovery. ""It was really coincidental,"" he said.
He emphasised that much more research was needed before the discovery could, if ever, lead to a human treatment: ""An important experiment is going to be putting this it into mice and see how it affects blood glucose levels. That's certainly very high on our priority list.
""But to get to a drug is a very long journey. We still have to learn a lot more about how this platypus hormone actually works.""","Platypus venom could pave the way for new treatments for type 2 diabetes, say Australian researchers."

Det Supt Katie Elliott said: ""Teams of specialist, search-trained police officers from both Suffolk and Norfolk will be carrying out the work to find anything that may be linked to the investigation.
""We need to find Corrie and discover what happened to him. While the search may not provide the answers as to what happened, it is something we need to do as our investigation continues.""
Steve Gaskin, a former detective with experience of carrying out large-scale searches during his time with the Metropolitan Police, described this latest operation as a ""mammoth task"".
He said officers will need to sift through all the earth that is moved by hand, ""because it's not just Corrie they're looking for"".
It would also be ""any other associated evidence"", such as his jacket, or ""anything that may have come out of his pockets"".
He said: ""They've also got to make sure any forensic evidence that's accrued is treated and dealt with properly... in case there's a criminal case.
""There's been a lapse of six months [since Corrie Mckeague went missing] and you can imagine what's on a rubbish dump - birds, rodents - so there's a good chance, with the weather and all the conditions, particularly if he's a number of metres down, that there will be an element of decomposition.
""This is a mammoth task and it is analogous, I would say, to looking for a needle in a haystack.""
Mr Mckeague was last seen at about 03:25 BST on 24 September.
Police seized a bin lorry in the early stages of the investigation, but no traces of Mr Mckeague were found in the vehicle and the landfill site was not searched at the time.
However, its route appeared to coincide with the movements of Mr Mckeague's phone.
Mr Mckeague' mother Nicola Urquhart previously told the BBC: ""Common sense suggests that the most likely place Corrie ended up is the landfill site or the incinerator.""
Some 8,000 tonnes of bulk material has been removed from the site to allow officers to safely access the search area.

The latest crisis followed a police analysis that IRA members were involved in the murder of a former IRA man.
Three senior republicans were arrested this week and subsequently released.
Mr Cameron said he was ""extremely worried"" about the crisis in the Northern Ireland Executive.
""I don't think it's right for the British government to step in and suspend these institutions. I want to see the politicians of Northern Ireland ... working out how to make these institutions work,"" he said.
""It is unacceptable in any part of our country to have active paramilitary groups. They have to be disbanded, and disbanded on all sides.""
Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness has said there are six weeks to resolve the outstanding difficulties in the political process and said Sinn Féin was up for the job.
Speaking at a party away-day at Gormanstown, County Meath, he said the last thing the DUP wanted now was an election.
He added that he had it in his power to force a poll, but he would not do so because he wanted the six weeks to see a resolution of all outstanding problems.
Who's who
Northern Ireland Executive: The ministerial team that runs Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont.
It is made up of British unionist, Irish nationalist and cross-community elected representatives, set up after an historic power-sharing agreement more than 20 years ago.
The largest party in the executive is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), followed by Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the Alliance Party.
DUP and UUP: Unionist parties that want to maintain Northern Ireland's union with Britain
Sinn Féin and SDLP: Nationalist parties aspiring to a united Ireland.
Alliance Party: Neutral on the issue of the union.
The Irish Republican Army (IRA): The IRA has existed in various forms in Ireland since the early part of the 20th Century but the latest political row concerns the Provisional IRA.
The Provisional IRA was the name used by a paramilitary organisation that killed more than 1,700 people during decades of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles, which began in 1969.
The IRA declared ceasefires as part of the Northern Ireland peace process and in July 2005 it announced a formal end to its armed campaign.
During the Troubles, Sinn Féin acted as the political wing of the IRA.
A fresh round of talks to address the issue of paramilitaries and outstanding issues around welfare and Northern Ireland's budget began on Tuesday.
However, they broke down after it was revealed that Sinn Féin's northern chairman, Bobby Storey, was one of three republicans arrested in connection with the murder of ex-IRA man Kevin McGuigan Snr last month.
All three were released unconditionally on Thursday. A fourth person, a 50-year-old woman was also arrested and then released.
Following the arrests, DUP leader and First Minister Peter Robinson said his ministers would quit if the assembly was not adjourned or suspended.
Mr Robinson stepped aside on Thursday after his party failed to get enough support to adjourn the assembly.
The party's Finance Minister, Arlene Foster, now the only remaining DUP minister, has taken over as acting first minister.
""Peter Robinson had stepped aside to concentrate on leading the party delegation in the talks and he has left me there as a gate keeper and to act as first minister in his absence from that job,"" she said.
Addressing the McGuigan murder, Chief Constable George Hamilton said that there was no evidence at that stage that the murder was sanctioned by the IRA, which he said was committed to politics and not engaged in terrorism.
Sinn Féin's leadership has insisted that the IRA no longer exists.
Asked on a possible IRA statement as a way to overcome current problems, Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams said ""P O'Neill has been decommissioned"", while Mr McGuinness added ""and he's not coming back"".
P O'Neill was the IRA's nom de plume used to sign IRA statements throughout the Troubles.
Following the police assessment on the murder, the Ulster Unionist Party withdrew from the Northern Ireland Executive.
Northern Ireland Executive crisis: Q&A
For months the power-sharing executive at Stormont has been deadlocked over budgetary matters.
Underlying this disagreement was Sinn Féin's refusal to implement welfare reforms introduced elsewhere in the UK.
However, the political crisis deepened last month after the police said current IRA members could have been involved in the murder of Belfast man, Kevin McGuigan.
Unionists argued that if the IRA remains active, Sinn Féin should be excluded from ministerial office.
The party said it would engage in talks only if the issue of the IRA was the first item to be dealt with.
The monitoring of paramilitary activity in Northern Ireland was conducted by the Independent Monitoring Commission (IMC) up until 2011.
Ms Villiers said re-instigating an independent authority to look at decommissioning command structures was a ""credible"" option.
""I think it wouldn't necessarily be appropriate to set up exactly the same structure that existed in the past and certainly one would need to ask it a different question. In the past the question was just about decommissioning and ceasefires,"" she said.
""I think now it is very clear we want to see these paramilitary organisations disband altogether. We also want to investigate the role of members of these organisations in relation to criminality.""",Prime Minister David Cameron has said he expects all the parties to take part when discussions on resolving the crisis within the Northern Ireland power-sharing executive resume next week.

"But is it possible dragons could ever exist beyond the pages of Celtic mythology or the celluloid of fantasy film?
Academics have suggested in a recent essay the creation of large, winged dragons using cutting-edge genome editing is not beyond the realms of possibility.
Is the seemingly far-fetched idea a flier or, like dragon's breath, just hot air? The BBC asked the authors.
The essay in The American Journal of Bioethics said spectacular animals could be brought to life using a targeted gene-editing system known as CRISPR-CAS9.
Co-authors Prof Hank T Greely, director of the Centre for Law and the Biosciences at Stanford Law School, and Prof R Alta Charo, Professor of Bioethics and Law at Wisconsin Law School, said their dragon suggestion was ""somewhat tongue-in-cheek"" but ""not impossible"".
""There are the possibilities of spectacles,"" they wrote. ""Animals and plants not created for personal use but to be exhibited.
""Consider, for example, the dragon. Basic physics will almost certainly combine with biological constraints to prevent the creation of flying or fire-breathing dragons.
""But a very large reptile that looks at least somewhat like the European or Asian dragon (perhaps with flappable if not flyable wings) could be someone's target of opportunity.""
And it may not be as improbable as it seems at first blush.
CRISPR and other similar techniques involve DNA being inserted, replaced, or removed from a genome using artificially engineered nucleases.
The method has been adopted by scientists around the world.
CRISPRs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) are sections of DNA, while CAS-9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9) is an enzyme.
They are found in bacteria, which use them to disable attacks from viruses.
They have led to the creation of patented ""GloFish"" that shine under UV light, the eradication of horns from certain cattle species, manipulation of crops and attempts to produce hypo-allergenic cats.
Artist Eduardo Kac even commissioned a French geneticist to create Alba, a genetically modified ""glowing"" rabbit.
Debate has raged over whether CRISPR, which occurs as part of a bacterial process, could be safely and ethically used on humans since 2012.
But professors Greely and Charo argue its potential to produce ""CRISPR critters"" is ""likely to be overlooked"" by legislators and regulators ""because they are unexpected"".
The method is ""cheaper and easier"" than older forms of genetic engineering and can be done ""outside the traditional laboratory setting"".
Their essay looks at the possible uses of CRISPR for de-extinction of wild species - such as 700,000-year-old horses - for domestic de-extinction - such as tomato species - and for making creatures of ""personal whim"".
They point out that Harvard geneticist George Church is using CRISPR to edit Asian elephant cell lines to give them some woolly mammoth genes.
Asked about the likelihood of dragons, the co-authors said: ""We imagine it would be low although not impossible with respect to appearance (the fire-breathing and flying aspects are undoubtedly beyond any plausible genetic engineering).
""In the US, the determining factor is usually cost as compared to return-on-investment, where cost can be substantial given the regulatory hurdles.
""Does this mean some determined and well-funded geneticist might do this as an artistic experiment, similar to the work done on the fluorescing rabbit?
""Yes. But the operative word is 'might'.""
A potential process could involve modifications to an existing large reptile - for instance, a Komodo dragon.
The professors said, even if scientists knew how to make them larger, there would likely be problems with the creature's mass increasing faster than its surface area or its bone cross-sections.
The first issue could make the animals overheat; the second might mean the edited reptile's bones would be too weak to hold its weight.
""If and when we actually come to understand in detail what every specific DNA sequence does and how they all fit together, though, all bets are off - things could move more quickly,"" they added.
Dr Sam Sternberg - formerly of the University of California's Doudna Lab, which pioneered work with CRISPR-CAS9 - said his boundaries were stretched when Minnesota firm Recombinetics announced it had used a gene-editing technology to dehorn certain types of cattle.
However, he is not hopeful genetic engineers could ever cross the Rubicon to create dragons.
""You're talking about, not just one or a few changes, you're talking about massive changes and it gets to the point where, how much can you cut and paste the DNA that causes some of the traits of one species to another?
""I would say it's probably bordering on impossible/never going to happen.""
Even if the difficulties connected with gene editing could be overcome, there remains the tricky task of assisted reproduction with an existing lizard species.
Giving birth to any edited dragon would involve taking stem cells from, say, a Komodo dragon before inserting an altered nucleus into an egg for in vitro fertilization (IVF) in an adult komodo.
That would be no mean feat; in December scientists carried out the first successful IVF on dogs after decades of trying.
""If you got access to Komodo dragons and could quickly resolve the regulatory, stem cell, and assisted reproduction problems, you could start tinkering.
""But it would likely take a very long time before you could hope to get something that looked much like a dragon,"" Prof Greely and Prof Charo said.
So, how far off might all this be?
""A while,"" they said.",The mythical dragon has been associated with Wales for more than a millennium and famously graces the national flag.
"World Ranger Day (31 July) is dedicated to the men and women who put themselves on the frontline to protect our wildlife from one of the biggest armed scourges of the 21st Century.
Some estimate that gangs of poachers kill two or three rangers every week in game reserves across Africa.
It has become a bitter battle against poaching.
If the elephants and the rhinos could release press statements on their respective international days, they would tell you that the killings of their kind have multiplied since 2006.
And even though some recent studies suggest the killing of elephants has slowed, some experts believe that the decline in deaths could be down to fewer elephants being alive to poach.
Organised criminals with sophisticated GPS systems and deadly arms seem to stop at nothing to get tusks and rhino horns to sell in Asian markets for millions of dollars.
It is the rangers who stand between them and the killers.
Farai Sevenzo:
""It is no surprise that South Sudan's protracted rebellions have affected animals and the men and women who try to protect them""
A recent WWF survey of game rangers in Africa found some rangers barely had the equipment, including boots, to fight poachers in Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo and were regularly abandoned as a low priority of governments.
Of those surveyed, 75% said they had been threatened by community members for the work they do in protecting wildlife and a staggering 54% said they would not want their children to become rangers - which is bad news for those elephants, rhinos and gorillas slowly dwindling to extinction.
Just two weeks ago the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority put out a tender for the supply of new vehicles for its directors and an advert for two new executives just when its working rangers, toiling to stop poachers in 45C heat, had not been paid for three months.
Members of a parliamentary committee on the environment noticed the lack of priorities and were not impressed.
More on poaching in Africa:

Does burning actually destroy ivory?

It is also clear that the pressure on a ranger can come from their own, so it is little wonder that some of them are turning from game keeper to poacher just to stay alive.
Zimbabwe has managed to capture two of its most-wanted poaching suspects in the last week, according to the state-run Chronicle newspaper.
Altogether 10 suspects were arrested in separate operations, though its report shows the difficulty of tracking down poachers.
The tools of their trade may be simple - the paper lists some being arrested with a couple of rifles, a silencer, ammunition, a knife, a torch and a getaway car - but their collusion with local chiefs makes them more lethal to animals and rangers alike.
It is no surprise that the deaths of elephants and rangers in DR Congo were at the hands of armed militias, and that South Sudan's protracted rebellions have affected animals and the men and women who try to protect them.
The director of South Sudan's Lantoto National Game Park, where 10 elephants were killed by poachers in June, says the instability in his country is to blame.
""You know animals are like people and when there is continuous presence of fighting and hunting down in the country, they tend to run away in search of peaceful environment,"" Col Natalino Lasuba recently told South Sudan's Radio Tamazuj.
He said park rangers faced challenges including heavy rains, lack of logistical and communication equipment, inadequate numbers - as well as the inevitable clashes with armed poachers.
Virunga National Park in DR Congo - home to the endangered gorillas and Africa's oldest park - documents the rangers who die in the line of duty and has set up a fund to help their widows.
One of the latest to die was 40-year-old Sebinyenzi Bavukirahe Yacinthe, who left behind a wife and eight children aged between two and 16 in January.
While Fidele Mulonga Mulegalega and Venant Mumbere Muvesevese were killed in an attack by Mai Mai rebels in March.
""These deaths break the unfathomable barrier of 150 rangers lost in a decade here in Virunga, over 10 of those in the last year alone,"" the park's director Emmanuel de Merode said in a statement at the time.
""Despite the wide progress we make here in many areas, we cannot sustain these kind of losses in what is still the most dangerous conservation job in the world.""
Whether it is South Sudan's Boma National Park, DR Congo's Garamba National Park or Kruger National Park in South Africa, the poachers are increasing their firepower and the fallout for the rangers is severe.
Not only are rangers' lives being lost to increased poaching, there is also the psychological fallout. It is creating a new kind of ""ranger trauma"" to seeing so many butchered animals littering the savannah, including those of rhino and elephant calves.
The animals too do not distinguish between poacher or ranger so some of the dead rangers have been trampled to death by the elephants they were protecting.
Considering that more than 14,000 elephants have been killed between 2003 and 2015, it barely registers as a concern for most African governments.
African governments should treat the prevalence of armed poaching as a national security emergency, and dedicate a large chunk of the defence budget to combating it robustly.
The ranger is in a war few acknowledge is happening on World Ranger Day and every day.

"The 28-year-old MTN-Qhubeka rider maintained his 13-second lead over Team Sky's Wouter Poels on Sunday's 14-lap final stage around central London.
Team Sky's Elia Viviani was awarded the stage win after Andre Greipel, who crossed the line first, was penalised.
Owain Doull, riding for Team Wiggins, was the highest placed Briton in third.
The Welshman finished 10th on the stage but picked up bonus seconds in the intermediate sprint to leapfrog Rasmus Guldhammer to end the race 42 seconds behind Boasson Hagen and also win the points classification.
Germany's Griepel beat Viviani by milimetres in Saturday's penultimate stage and was again first over the finish line on Sunday.
However, the Lotto-Soudal rider was adjudged to have impeded Viviani in the sprint for the line and was relegated to the back of the bunch by race officials.
""I didn't see Viviani coming,"" said Greipel.
""Everybody was on the limit on the final corner. I didn't do anything for purpose that's for sure. That's sprinting.""
After winning his third stage of the race, Italian Viviani, who crossed the finish line with his hand in the air in complaint, said: ""He came across a little bit and that edged me towards the barriers.

"The event - Scotland's Thatched Buildings: Developing a plan for the future - will follow up on a survey of Scotland's thatched buildings last year.
Scotland has about 305 thatched roof buildings.
May's event will be held close to the historic Leanach Cottage.

Owners and managers of thatched roof properties and craftspeople have been invited to attend.

"I am a ""Macaulay's child"" - usually a pejorative term for an Anglicised Indian - who went to an English medium school, read Dickens and Greene and listened to The Beatles and Stones.
It sounds a bit fey to attribute all this to a man who took on the Orientalists and won the argument for making English language education the basis of a ""class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern; a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in taste, in opinions, in morals and in intellect"".
But, as Zareer Masani writes in the biography, history has proved Macaulay right.
More than 60 years after independence, English has become a passport to upward mobility in the wildly aspirational former colony, and more Indians are learning the language than ever before. As Masani points out, India has endured linguistic division of states and language riots, but English medium schools thrive in towns and villages today.
Masani's admiration for Macaulay, a complex man of protean talents - historian, statesman, scholar, poet, essayist, parliamentarian, colonial administrator, intellectual - is evident in this highly engaging book.
But he's also careful to point out that Macaulay was racist, harboured prejudices about native Indians and customs and, despite being a linguist, did not attempt to master any Indian language. ""Macaulay was notoriously dismissive, if not downright hostile and contemptuous, about native Indian, and particularly Hindu, customs and religious superstitions,"" writes Masani.
Macaulay spent four years in Calcutta, the imperial capital that was at the centre of an intellectual and cultural renaissance, but very little of that is mentioned in his writings.
He grumbled about the heat, public entertainments in the city - ""vile actingâ€¦ viler opera-singingâ€¦ and things which they called reunions"" - and ""dull"" formal dinners peppered with ""deplorable twaddle"". The life-long bachelor also had a misogynist streak - he found the lawyers and civil servants he knew in Calcutta had ""disagreeable wives"". He steadfastly believed that India was not ready for self-rule, and what it could really ""have [is] the next best thing - a firm and impartial despotism"".
Yet, in what was the first imperial education policy in British India, Macaulay aggressively pushed for English as the medium for as many Indians as possible to be given a Western education.
Masani finds this vision ""more egalitarian and inclusive"" and less elitist than his arch critics who wanted to promote English among a small elite. Macaulay took a personal interest in running five new English medium schools which opened in Bengal, a year and a half after the reforms began in 1835 - in a single town in Bengal, he wrote, 1,400 boys were learning English. He disliked an excessively pedagogic approach to teaching English - ""Give them Jack the Giant Killer and Tom Thumb"", he wrote, ""and then let them have Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver"".
By 1838, when he returned to Britain, Macaulay's reforms had led to the setting up of 40 English medium schools in Bengal which were open to all, quite revolutionary in a society ""where lower castes had been strictly forbidden to study"". Later, in 1853, his father Charles Trevelyan told a parliamentary committee that some Indians now spoke purer English ""than we speak ourselves"". More than a century and a half later, many of Macaulay's children can still make the same claim and some of the world's finest writers in English are Indian.
Macaulay: Pioneer of India's Modernisation by Zareer Masani is published by Random House India","""If you're an Indian reading this book in English, it's probably because of Thomas Macaulay,"" says the front cover blurb on a new biography of a man who foisted the Queen's language on India."

"EJ has weathered a snow storm and harassment from rival ospreys while incubating her clutch of three eggs. All hatched over the past few days.
The RSPB suspects mate Odin, who was bringing fish to the chicks, was frightened off by another male.
On Monday, an osprey was at the nest with a fish but the chicks were dead.
The bird is thought to have been EJ.
RSPB Scotland said she was expected to remain at the nest and guard it against being taken over by other females.
It is possible to view the nest site via a webcam. Footage on Monday morning appeared to show the nest had been abandoned.
Later, on occasions, an adult osprey was seen at the nest, at one point with a fish.
At the weekend, RSPB Scotland said it had decided not to intervene in what it described ""heart breaking"" but natural process playing out at its reserve.
EJ, who is 20 years old this year, has been visiting Loch Garten for 15 years and has reared 25 chicks over that time with mate Odin and other males.
The nest is in a tree on an RSPB Scotland reserve.
EJ and her long-term mate Odin are the most successful breeding pair at the Loch Garten site.
Over previous seasons, 17 of their chicks have fledged.
Ospreys migrate from west Africa to Scotland to breed and can be seen hunting for fish from rivers and lochs.
EJ's breeding seasons have been fraught with drama in the past.
Incidents have included eggs being kicked out of the nest by a male bird and battles between EJs and rival females over the nest.","All three chicks being raised by a well-known female osprey in the Cairngorms have died, RSPB Scotland has confirmed."

"Belle Gibson gained fame in Australia after she claimed to have beaten cancer using natural remedies rather than medical intervention.
She launched a successful app and cookbook, but later admitted the diagnosis was made up.
Consumer Affairs Victoria is aiming to prosecute Ms Gibson for allegedly breaking Australian consumer law.
The regulator said it had conducted an in-depth investigation of Ms Gibson's activities and had applied to Australia's Federal Court for leave to pursue legal action.
Ms Gibson's claims to have cured her cancer with Ayurvedic medicine, oxygen therapy and a gluten and refined sugar-free diet propelled her to prominence.
She capitalised on her fame with a successful app and a cookbook, both called The Whole Pantry, and promised to deliver a share of the profits to several charities.
But the money allegedly never reached the charities and cracks began to appear in Ms Gibson's story.
She later admitted to the Australian Women's Weekly magazine that none of her claims was true.

"At least 183 procedures have been cancelled at hospitals across the north-east since the beginning of November, the health board said.
They include 13 procedures due to take place at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary since 1 January.
The health board blamed ""staffing challenges and winter pressures, not budgetary constraints"".
It said it had problems filling vacancies due to complex training requirements of theatre nursing but procedures were only rearranged as a ""last resort"".
A patients' group raised concerns that elderly patients were being affected disproportionately because of the lack of staff with specialist skills.
The Patient Action Co-ordination Team, which provides support to patients in Grampian, said orthopaedics and eye surgery for conditions such as cataracts are among those worst affected.
It said that because these are ailments which predominantly affect older people, they are worst affected by the number of cancellations.
The patients group also warned that the cancellations will affect the north-east health authority's waiting time target performance.
Dr Annie Ingram, director of workforce at NHS Grampian, said: ""We've made huge progress over the last year but, like other public sector organisations in Grampian, we face challenges in recruiting.""
""We apologise to any patients whose procedures have had to be re-scheduled.""
She said that around 30,000 operations are carried out every year in the region and the number which are postponed is usually between 1 and 2%.
""Rearranging elective procedures is a last resort for us and is done according to clinical prioritisation: our most clinically urgent patients will still be seen,"" she added.
""When providing staff for a theatre list of operations on any given day, the theatre nurses must meet the needs and skills required for that speciality and have enough knowledge to act as a skilled practitioner to maintain safe practice.
""Vacancies have been difficult to fill due to the requirement to try and train staff in what is  a complex area of nursing.
""Normally when staffing is at a sufficient level, staff rotate specialties, gaining more knowledge and skills in a variety of different areas and subsequently building more resilience into the service.""",NHS Grampian has had to cancel routine operations because of a shortage of theatre nurses.
"The world number two is due to become a father and will, I'm sure, cherish that above anything he could ever achieve on a tennis court.
But I don't think this new year will be notable in the Murray household simply for the addition of a welcome new member. There's every indication major trophies will be celebrated too.
It's only a few weeks since Murray completed the perfect Davis Cup year; unbeaten as he helped return the famous old trophy to these shores for the first time in nearly 80 years.
That was one of his main targets for 2015. Mission accomplished, and in some style, beating a fine player in Belgium's David Goffin in his own back yard, on clay, in straight sets, with one of the best match points - and winning shots - ever seen.
The feel-good factor from such an achievement can last months. When Novak Djokovic savoured success with Serbia in the Davis Cup at the end of 2010, he followed it up with one of the best years in the history of tennis. He didn't lose a match until the semi-finals of the French Open, and won the other three Grand Slam titles.
Incredibly, the super Serb was even better last year, reaching all four major finals, and winning three, as well as six out of the eight Masters Series events he entered.
Could Andy do a Novak? That's perhaps asking too much. But I certainly think 2016 will be the year Murray's major count gets going again.
It's two and a half years since he won the second of his two Slam titles. The game has moved on since then, and the Scot has had back surgery and switched coaches.
He was, however, much more like his old self in 2015, winning four titles, including his first two on clay, and competing well for three of the four main prizes.
Finishing the year ranked second in the world, for the first time in his career, will have done the confidence no harm either; nor will beating Roger Federer, albeit in the end-of-season IPTL exhibition.
He'll go into 2016 with an extra spring in his step and as the second seed for the Australian Open, which gets under way in just over two weeks' time in Melbourne. Murray knows he doesn't have to worry about Novak Djokovic until the final, should both men get there.
So the Scot will reflect on 2015 as a year that ended much better than it began.
Ranked sixth in the world when the notes of Auld Lang Syne were fading away, he'd just been thrashed 6-0 6-1 by Federer at the World Tour Finals in London.
When Murray headed down under to Melbourne in January, the first Grand Slam of the season once again brought out the best in him as he reached his fourth Australian Open final.
It proved, however, to be the one that got away; from a break up in the third set against Djokovic, Murray lost 12 of the next 13 games in that final. But it was a collapse that didn't affect his season, which turned out to be his most consistent yet on the tour.
By the time the French Open came around in May, Murray was being touted - tongue-in-cheek perhaps - as the new king of clay, having won two titles on the surface, including the Madrid Masters, where he beat Rafael Nadal in his own back yard.
Only a superb five-set display from Djokovic stopped Murray at Roland Garros, this time in the semi-final.
After opening the grass court season by claiming a fourth Queens Club title, it was then on to Wimbledon. Again Murray looked strong as he progressed to the semi-finals, where a rejuvenated Roger Federer lay in wait.
A stunning Swiss serving display dealt desperate disappointment once again for the Scot, ending his hopes of a second Wimbledon crown. But there was no time to dwell. There was a Davis Cup quarter-final against France to be won, following on from the fine win against the USA in Glasgow in March.
After winning the doubles with big brother Jamie, Andy dug deep once again to see off Gilles Simon and book Britain's place in the semi-finals against Australia. That meant another trip back to Scotland, and another noisy win in Glasgow's Emirates Arena.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Being the driving force behind Britain's first Davis Cup final appearance since 1978 meant Murray had probably played too much tennis by the time the US Open came around. He did win another Masters Series event, beating Djokovic in the final in Montreal.
He couldn't get past the giant South African Kevin Anderson in New York, however, and so failed to make a Grand Slam quarter-final for the first time in five years.
Murray's champagne moment of 2015 was still to come.
At the end of November, the pride of Dunblane collapsed in tears on the red clay of Ghent. He was instantly mobbed by his brother Jamie and the rest of his team-mates in celebration of Britain's finest hour in the Davis Cup since Fred Perry et al in 1936.
It was an achievement that made Murray - and the British team - winners at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards. You know it's been a good year when Andy Murray starts cracking jokes in front of a huge audience of his sporting peers, and millions watching on TV.
If he wins another Slam - or defends his Olympic title -  there's no chance Murray's 2016 will be duller than a weekend in Worthing.",This will be a landmark year for Andy Murray - I have no hesitation in predicting that whatsoever.

A spokeswoman said: ""On Christmas Eve the Gormley sculpture at Kimmeridge Bay again succumbed to persistent heavy seas, this time presumably hit by a boulder hurled off the beach by the force of the storm.
""We are taking steps to recover the work imminently.
""It was always intended to have a relationship with the landscape and nature.
""Its position on this exposed stretch of Kimmeridge Bay has certainly brought that dynamic to the fore.""
The trust said it did not yet know where the installation would be moved to, but that the ""most important thing is removing it safely, given the weather, location, tide times, and holiday season"".
John Bickerton, owner of Lulworth House B&B, found the statue during a walk with his family on Saturday.
He said: ""We were sprinkling my mother's ashes on the far side of the bay before going round to take a family picture with the sculpture.
""We quickly realised it wasn't standing and when we got there could see it had sheared off at its thinnest point - the ankles. This time it looks like it might be fatal.""
Sir Antony said he was ""thrilled"" when the sculpture toppled into the sea in September, calling it proof of its ""dynamic relationship"" with nature.",A conservation charity has said a cast iron sculpture by Sir Antony Gormley felled for the second time in just over two months will not be reinstated.
"The Department of Health is launching an eight-week consultation on Monday to expand the rating programme which is run by the Care Quality Commission.
The government want the ratings to cover up to 1,000 facilities including those offering pregnancy termination services and substance misuse advice.
The health secretary said it would help end the ""lottery"" of poor practice.
""Anyone who chooses to have a cosmetic procedure should have high quality and safe care - and that's why we have a tough regulator in place to help people make an informed decision,"" Jeremy Hunt said.
""Our proposals to extend the CQC's powers to rate more providers are an important step forward in improving standards and will help to end the lottery of poor practice in parts of the cosmetic industry.""
The proposals also involve rating independent community health providers, ambulance services and dialysis units, with 100 cosmetic surgery clinics among the 1,000 providers who could be rated.
The CQC has rated more than 10,000 providers since 2014 but it has focused on providers with the most patients, including NHS Trusts, Foundation Trusts, GP practices, adult social care providers and independent hospitals..
It does currently inspect cosmetic surgery clinics, - but does not rate them as being ""outstanding"", ""good"", ""requires improvement"" or ""inadequate"" and publish the results online, as it does with hospitals and GPs.
Officials believe extending the scheme is a necessary step towards improving safety and informed choice after high profile scares such as the PIP breast implant scandal in 2012.",Cosmetic surgery clinics in England which are not up to standard could be named under new government proposals.
"The police said a car was set on fire in Main Street, Crumlin, between 03:20 BST and 03:40 BST on Saturday and the blaze spread to the takeaway.
Residents from flats above the takeaway escaped without injury. Other premises on the street have been damaged.
The police said, at this stage, they were not treating the incident as a hate crime.
SDLP councillor Thomas Burns said it was unclear what had actually happened but it looked like the car had been rammed against the shutter of the restaurant.
""This is an absolute disgrace,"" he said.
""Whether this vehicle has been moved or burnt and has been rammed against the shutters of this takeaway, for the people living upstairs, it could have been an absolute disaster.
""If the blaze had got going, if the people had not got out, the smoke could have killed them, never mind the fire.
""I'm horrified that these Chinese people have been targeted. Why it was them, is a question that is being asked.""
Councillor Mervyn Rea of the Ulster Unionist Party said: ""That vehicle could have exploded, it could have caused damage where it was parked, it could have caused injury to anyone on the street and, equally so, when it propelled into the shop and set the shop ablaze.
""It could have caused a nasty accident when it was veering across the street.""
Anne-Marie Logue, Sinn FÃ©in councillor, said people in the area were ""aghast as to why this has happened"".
""We are very annoyed for the business involved as well and the family are devastated,"" she said.
""It's obviously put them out of business for quite a few weeks.
""Opportunists decided to break into the car. The car was put on fire and unfortunately it was directed towards this shop. I'm just glad that nobody has been hurt.""

"The bank's monthly Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) is a survey of a panel of firms that tracks indicators such as new orders, employment and exports
It had shown growth for 17 months in a row but in December it indicated a slight drop in economic output.
The bank's chief economist said it is not clear if this is a blip or if it signals ""the start of a significant deterioration in business conditions.""
Richard Ramsey said that Northern Ireland is ""not unique in experiencing an economic slowdown"".
The equivalent PMI survey for the UK shows the weakest rate of growth in 19 months, while global output growth slipped to a 14-month low in December.
Mr Ramsey said external economic conditions have a major bearing on Northern Ireland's economic performance, particularly for exporters.
Economic stagnation in the Eurozone and the wider global economic slowdown has impacted upon the local manufacturing sector in particular.
Northern Ireland's manufacturing firms reported their first decline in output, new orders and employment since mid-2013.
The economist said it was ""perhaps concerning"" that Northern Ireland's slowdown has been more marked than the rest of the UK.
However, he added that with Northern Ireland's two most important trading partners - the UK and the Republic of Ireland - are still posting strong rates of expansion and said this should drive growth in the local economy for some time to come.","The NI economy stalled in December, research by the Ulster Bank suggests."

Fabulous from the GB quartet. Having spent the day with them as they trained at Loughborough, there was no missing that this is the tightest of teams - true friends, proper racers. Philip in the mother role, Asher-Smith as head girl, Henry the loud one, Neita the kid. Together history makers.
Tianna Bartoletta, Allyson Felix, English Gardner and Tori Bowie were allowed to compete in the final after running again - on their own - following Thursday's semi-final.
The baton was accidentally knocked out of Felix's hand by Brazil's Kauiza Venancio as she prepared to hand over to Gardner for the third leg.
The US successfully appealed, and ran only two tenths of a second short of the world record at the second attempt.
Bartoletta and Felix were part of the US team that clocked 40.82 to win at London 2012, and Felix has become the first woman to collect five athletics gold medals.
""It's very special. It was great to join these women tonight. It's just a very unique experience,"" Felix said of her milestone.

Not for the first time the Welsh first minister is warning of a ""constitutional crisis"". And not for the first time in recent weeks he has put Theresa May's government on the back foot.
The first ministers' ""power-grab"" is what the UK government sees as an essential way of ensuring Welsh farmers (among others) can continue to trade after Brexit before UK-wide frameworks are decided. The UK government has put together a factsheet on the Bill and devolution that puts its side of the argument.
Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""I have got to look Welsh farmers in the eye and tell them yes they will be able to have the opportunity to continue to sell their Welsh lambs in France, and across Europe.
""But in order to get to that position we need this framework in place. That is fundamental to the trade arrangements."" Discuss.
In other news, Wales's youngest MP has delivered his maiden speech.

""Thousands of people from across the county have benefited from his advice and assistance, and I hope to continue with his good work. I wish him, and his family, the very best for the future.""
As is traditional, he spoke of the delights of his constituency. ""We can also justifiably claim to be the capital of Welsh culture,"" he said. ""In addition to housing the National Library and two universities, Ceredigion has two thriving publishing houses in Talybont and Llandysul, and the recently restored castle at Cardigan played host to the first national Eisteddfod in 1176.""
He also praised ""the emphatic landscape and the famous quick-witted humour of the Cardi"" but also noted Ceredigion's challenges. ""Several of my predecessors in this House have pointed to the tragic irony that Ceredigion bestows upon its youth an unrivalled education, but offers them a paucity of job opportunities and affordable housing.
""For decades, our county has lost the potential and the vitality of its youth. Around half her young people leave the county by the time they reach 25 years of age.""

Her father Ben Butler claims she fell, but the prosecution said her injuries were caused by being thrown against a wall or hit with a ""blunt weapon"".
The 36-year-old denies murder and a separate charge of child cruelty.
At the Old Bailey, prosecutor Ed Brown QC said a post-mortem examination revealed the child suffered skull fractures from at least two severe impacts.
Read more updates on this story and other news from London
He said the doctor who carried out the examination and a neurological pathologist agreed her injuries were unlikely to have been caused by an accidental fall.
A third expert, a forensic pathologist, believed Ellie's major head injury was ""the result of one or more very forceful blunt impacts, arising through being thrown against a wall or the ground, or struck with a heavy blunt weapon"", the court heard.
""A domestic accident could not have given rise to these complex, catastrophic and rapidly fatal injuries,"" Mr Brown added.
The court has heard how Ellie's parents, Mr Butler and Jennie Gray, summoned an ambulance two hours after her injuries were believed to have been caused.
Mr Butler and Ms Gray, also 36, deny child cruelty over an untreated broken shoulder Ellie suffered weeks before her death.
Ms Gray has admitted perverting the course of justice.
Mr Brown told jurors it was a ""distressing case"" of a father accused of murdering his daughter and failing to seek medical help for her earlier injury.
Ms Gray had been ""determined and persistent"" in trying to protect him by hiding and destroying evidence, he said.
On the day of Ellie's death, on 28 October 2013, Mr Butler and Ms Gray exchanged a series of phone calls and texts, records show.
He tried to call her at her office at 12:46 but reached a voicemail message and sent a text asking her to ""answer"".
Her colleague Tracey Bernstein said in a statement that the way Ms Gray got up and left the office was ""just not right"".
Another former workmate, Victoria Harris, said she had seen Ms Gray looking ""agitated"" on the phone. ""It did appear to me it was more than just a secret conversation,"" she added.
Minutes later Ms Gray was caught on CCTV dashing out of her office, near the Old Bailey.
She sent a text to her manager to say she had left for home as she was ""feeling unwell"".
But taxi driver Derek Greenwood, who drove her back to Sutton, overheard her on her mobile phone saying loudly ""you have done what?"", ""you have gone where?"" and ""you're joking"".
The court also heard from their neighbour, Lucy Jackson who recalled hearing arguments and a raised male voice coming from their home.
Jurors have previously been told that Mr Butler has had a conviction for assaulting Ellie as a baby quashed. Her parents then won a High Court ruling to return her to the family from foster care.
The trial continues.","A six-year-old girl's ""catastrophic"" head injuries could not have been caused by an accidental fall, as claimed by her father, a court heard."

Saturday's defeat was their first loss at home in seven years - and their first to the British and Irish Lions in 24.
And while they were beaten by Ireland as recently as November, that was in the relative anonymity of the American city of Chicago, not in their own backyard.
The Kiwi public is loyal, but expectant. The All Blacks are meant to win, even with 14 men. So how have they reacted to defeat?
Minutes after the final whistle at the Westpac Stadium, as the Lions fans flocked deliriously into the Wellington evening, callers to Radio Sport NZ were jamming the airwaves.
""I hope you aren't going to make excuses - the Lions were too good,"" cried Owen, the first to have his say.
""I wonder if this would have been the Lions' night, even if Sonny Bill Williams had stayed on the field,"" reflected presenter Matthew Buck, who revelled in the sheer vibrancy of the occasion, as opposed to stewing in defeat.
""They were desperate,"" agreed expert summariser Ross Bond, who praised the Lions' inspired defence and smothering back row.
The next morning, the Herald on Sunday splashed on the Lions ""roaring back"" to square the series, with the Star majoring on the key flashpoint in the game - the red card to Williams and the influence of referee Jerome Garces.
The player ratings in the Herald caused a stir, with the irrepressible Lions lock Maro Itoje given a 4/10. Online ratings later had Itoje as a more realistic 9/10.
""The Lions were numerically and tactically superior,"" Marc Hinton wrote in The Press, and this sense of acceptance is echoed across the Kiwi media and public, albeit coupled with a fierce desire to restore normality in the Eden Park decider.
Support for the All Blacks permeates every level of New Zealand society, male and female, young and old.
At St Joseph's Primary School in Queenstown, in the heart of Otago, the children are still coming to terms with the hurt of defeat.
Aged between 10 and 11, they struggle to recall the last time the All Blacks were beaten on home soil.
""We normally win - it doesn't feel that good when we lose,"" was the reaction of 11-year-old Thomas, who says he dreams of one day becoming an All Black and following his hero Ben Smith.
""I felt like throwing the table at the TV - but they deserved it.""
But disappointment turns to confidence when looking ahead to Saturday's decisive Test.
""We'll win 70-30 on Saturday,"" insists 10-year-old Samuel.
""You are dreaming,"" retorts his friend Mason, who opts for a more realistic scoreline - though the All Blacks still come out on top, of course.
On the flight from Queenstown to Auckland, stewardess Trudie insists the Auckland weather will be much more to the All Blacks' liking this weekend.
""Beauden is usually such a good kicker,"" she laments, referring to the three kickable penalties missed by fly-half Beauden Barrett at Westpac Stadium.
However, while New Zealanders have reacted with relative calmness and introspection to the loss, the one gripe has been over a perceived inconsistency in the disciplinary process.
While Williams has copped a four-week ban for his charge on Anthony Watson - ruling him out of Saturday's Test - Mako Vunipola and Sean O'Brien will both be available for the Auckland decider.
Vunipola escaped a citing for a no-arms clear-out on Barrett, while O'Brien's citing for a challenge on wing Waisake Naholo was dismissed.
""A case could be made that both Vunipola and Sean O'Brien shouldn't be available for the deciding test,"" says Kiwi journalist and broadcaster Jim Kayes.
""O'Brien was cited for a swinging arm that knocked out wing Waisake Naholo. He was cleared by the same all-Australian judicial panel that banned Williams.""
Aaron Goile, writing in The Press, adds: ""It's just another one for rugby's land of confusion.""
Pushed on the issue, All Blacks assistant coach Ian Foster stayed diplomatic. ""It's an awkward area, we all know that, and it's a hard area to get right,"" he said.
While the Lions players have had two days off in scenic Queenstown, the All Blacks have done the complete opposite - spending the start of the week smarting and training hard in the Auckland bubble.
But the theme coming out of both camps is the same: the 'Blacklash' is coming, and the New Zealand players are embracing the magnitude of Saturday's showdown.
""We have learned a lot. I am really excited about what we can do this week back at Eden Park,"" says scrum-half Aaron Smith, who admits the All Blacks were too blunt in attack in Wellington.
""Hurt. Angered. Frustrated. You name it, the All Blacks are ready to mine the emotions for a week they're happy to say has a World Cup final feel about it,"" adds Hinton in The Press.
The All Blacks haven't lost successive matches since 2011, before head coach Steve Hansen took charge.
Lose to the Lions on Saturday, and the public inquest really will begin.","The All Blacks don't lose very often, especially in New Zealand."
"The official report warned that police behaviour, particularly with stop and search had had a corrosive effect on community relations. A subsequent inquiry by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary identified  an ""alarming"" 27% of stop and searches in which there were no reasonable grounds to conduct the search.  The Home Office has since announced a consultation on reform.
There is a sense of deja vu with all this. An inquiry into the the 1981 Brixton riots blamed disproportionate use of stop and search. An independent report on Tottenham's Broadwater Farm riots in 1985 blamed racist policing. Senior officers promised improvements then... as now.
The Scotland Yard Commissioner Bernard Hogan Howe has set a target to increase public confidence in the Met by 20% by 2016 and has introduced stricter criteria on the use of stop and search. However, the latest monthly figure for Tottenham and the surrounding borough finds 666 people were stopped and searched - almost double the figure two months before. It is work in progress.
That said, the buzzword in the police at the moment is ""legitimacy"" - an oft-stated determination that officers return to the values of Robert Peel and the principle of policing by consent.","When the smoke cleared from the riots triggered by Mark Duggan's shooting, uncomfortable questions for the police emerged."
"The singer-songwriter, 74, will play her seminal album Tapestry in full, followed by a selection of other hits.
It will be the first chance to see the King play the UK since her City Streets tour reached the Albert Hall in 1989.
""I can't wait to perform Tapestry from beginning to end for the first time... in the heart of one of my favourite cities,"" said the star. ]
The concert takes place on 3 July, with headliners on other nights including Take That, Florence + The Machine and Kendrick Lamar.
Speaking to BBC 6 Music, the singer said it ""actually wasn't my idea"" to play the album in full, but ""no-one has ever thought to ask [before] and I loved the the idea.""
""I'll be adding other songs because it would be a very short set if I only did Tapestry,"" she continued.  ""I might actually even have it on my social networks where people can offer up their favourites and see if we can get a consensus and help me figure out which songs to add.""
""The whole thing is very exciting to me,"" she added. ""I'm really looking forward to it.""
Recorded in the hippie utopia of Laurel Canyon in 1971, Tapestry featured a dozen classic songs, including It's Too Late, I Feel The Earth Move and You've Got A Friend.
Intimate and emotional, the record made King a star - but avid fans knew she had already been an enormously ­successful ­songwriter for more than a decade, writing hits like The Loco-Motion, Pleasant Valley Sunday and I'm Into Something Good with her lyricist ­husband Gerry Goffin.
She put her own stamp on some of those earlier songs - including (You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman and Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow - on Tapestry, which spent 15 consecutive weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 and was, until Thriller, the world's biggest-selling record by a solo artist.

"Ben Smith, 34, began his charity attempt on 1 September 2015 and ran 284 consecutive marathons in 284 days.
He then developed an umbilical hernia in June which forced him to stop for 10 days to recover before resuming and making up the lost mileage.
Mr Smith, from Bristol, was joined by about 350 people who set off with him at 10:00 BST on his 401st marathon.
The return loop from Millennium Square in Bristol to Portishead is expected to take the runners about seven hours to complete.

"The Medway Queen took more than 7,000 trapped men from beaches in 1940.
Restoration work began last year with help from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the European Regional Development Fund.
The government said administrative errors had led to the suspension of EU funding and it was working to get payments released.
Restoration work on the ship's hull began in Bristol last April with money from a ??1.86m Heritage Lottery Grant.
Medway Council applied to the European Regional Development Fund for a grant to complete the restoration and bring the ship home.
The final stages of the project are being undertaken at a workshop in Gillingham by 16 people, including nine young apprentices whose jobs are now under threat, as there is only enough money until the end of April.
Peter Skinner, Labour MEP for the South East, said EU funding to all UK partners within the Interreg 2 Seas programme had been suspended after the UK government failed to meet the standards demanded by auditors.
He said the problems had nothing to do with the Medway Queen project.
""The Medway Queen has taken on local young people and is giving them practical work skills through apprenticeships.
""Through no fault of theirs funding has been suspended. That can't be right,"" Mr Skinner said.
""I've been pushing ministers; they need to find a solution. I have also demanded a meeting with the [European] commissioner. I want him on the case.
""The project is a great opportunity for the apprentices and they shouldn't be in danger of losing out because of some bureaucratic foul up.""
In a statement, the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ""This funding programme is run by a managing authority in Nord-Pas de Calais, France.
""Nevertheless, the department is very disappointed with the European Commission's decision to withhold payments to UK project partners and we are working intensively to get these payments released.""",The restoration of a paddle steamer which rescued Allied troops during the Dunkirk evacuations is under threat after European funding was suspended.

Riot police used tear gas to stop them reaching the historic city centre.
The far right's Marine Le Pen has spoken in Nice and centrist Emmanuel Macron visited a troubled Paris suburb.
Opinion polls taken since the first round on Sunday suggest Mr Macron, candidate of the En Marche (On The Move) movement, will easily beat Ms Le Pen, who has temporarily stood down as leader of the National Front (FN), in the second round on 7 May.
However, Ms Le Pen upstaged her rival on Tuesday when she turned up in his northern home town of Amiens just as he was visiting himself.
Ms Le Pen found herself under fire again on Thursday as EU sources accused her of defrauding the European Parliament of about €5m (£4m; $5.4m), allegedly paying FN assistants who were not really working for MEPs but were engaged in party work in France.

In Rennes, between 950 and 1,500 demonstrators marched in the city centre, French media report, after a peaceful rally.
When a group of about 50 tried to occupy the railway station, police used tear gas and one officer cut off from the rest briefly drew his pistol to protect himself, Le Parisien daily reports (in French).
Unrest continued in the city centre, with police bringing in a helicopter to survey the crowd, AFP news agency says.
Placards read ""Expel Marine Le Pen, not immigrants"" and ""We don't want Macron or Le Pen"".
Other unrest was reported in the western city of Nantes and parts of the capital Paris.
Since Mr Macron and Ms le Pen narrowly won the first round on Sunday, some supporters of the losing candidates have advocated a protest vote against both on 7 May.
Mr Macron visited the deprived Paris suburb of Sarcelles on Thursday to meet local people in a stadium where he played football briefly with delighted children.
Sarcelles, home to large Muslim and Jewish communities, saw riots in the summer of 2014 in which Jewish-owned businesses and a synagogue were targeted.
Mr Macron accused Ms Le Pen of not being willing to visit ""a district like this"". ""France is not hatred and rejection of others,"" he said.
Speaking later in an interview for the TF1 channel, he said France's biggest challenge was mass employment and it needed a policy ""which allows companies to hire and invest"".
He promised, if elected, fundamental reform of labour laws this summer.
Elsewhere in the interview, Mr Macron vowed to:
Ms Le Pen gave her first big rally of the second round in the southern city of Nice, which was traumatised by the Bastille Day lorry attack claimed by so-called Islamic State last year.
She accused Mr Macron, a former banker, of being the candidate of the ""oligarch class"" whose idea of France was a space where ""everything can be bought and sold"".
Portraying herself as a patriot to the cheering crowd, she said the election was a ""referendum for or against France"" and she promised to halt ""mass immigration"".
""I will give France back its borders immediately because I choose France,"" she said.
Describing Nice as a city ""martyred by Islamist terrorism"", she said she would show no ""weakness in the face of Islamic fundamentalism"".
The rally ended with a rendition of the national anthem, La Marseillaise, which was sung twice at Ms Le Pen's request from the stage. ""Forward to victory, my friends!"" she cried.
Local FN representative Lionel Tivoli told Reuters news agency earlier that party membership in Nice's Alpes-Maritimes region had jumped from 740 two years ago to 3,500-4,000 now, driven in particular by the attack.
However, sports coach Dominique Eche, 62, whose children narrowly escaped the attack, told Reuters:   ""I saw the Nice attack from the inside and I find it appalling to try and benefit from such attacks, to say: 'It wouldn't have happened if I'd been in power'.""",Teenagers in Rennes and other French cities have held rallies or blocked schools in a protest against both presidential candidates.

"This is on a par with US President Barack Obama meeting with Cuba's Raul Castro except, unlike Washington and Havana, the two sides still haven't normalised relations. In fact they haven't even signed a peace treaty and in 66 years they have taken very different paths.
No agreements will be signed, no joint statements made, but China's Xi Jinping and Taiwan's Ma Ying-jeou will have an hour-long meeting and a casual dinner afterwards. It could get awkward and here are some of the questions that could crop up.
China has hundreds of missiles targeted at Taiwan to warn the island against declaring formal independence. Beijing still considers Taiwan a province to be reunified with the mainland one day and has not renounced the use of force to take it back. In fact, one of the main reasons for its military build-up is to counter possible US assistance to Taiwan if Beijing were to try to take back militarily.
Mr. Ma would argue: ""If you want to be friends, you must remove these missiles.""
""Not that simple,"" Mr Xi might answer. Doing so could embolden pro-independence groups in Taiwan who want the island to be recognised as a completely separate country from China.
The meeting will take place less than three months before Taiwan holds presidential and legislative races, but truly democratic elections like these are not in China's vocabulary. Taiwan, on the other hand, has developed into a vibrant democracy and is proud of its system.
Over dinner, Mr Ma could share his low approval rating headaches with Mr Xi and even make jokes about how hard it is to finish a speech when protesters are trying to throw shoes at him. Mr Xi might just politely smile and think to himself: ""And you wonder why we run things like we do?""
Mr Xi will be eager to push relations forward. During Mr Ma's seven years in office, the two sides have signed many agreements - from those that have allowed first-ever direct flights to ones that bring millions of Chinese tourists to Taiwan each year, not to mention tariff-cutting trade deals.
China is eager to link Taiwan's economy and society even closer to the mainland's, and begin talking about unification.
But Mr Ma will have to explain that public opinion does not support more deals and such talks at the moment. Many people are worried too many deals signed too quickly and without enough public oversight may make the island over-dependent on China and vulnerable to unification pressures.
Mr Ma might explain to Mr Xi: ""In Taiwan, unlike mainland China, public opinion matters a lot. That is how I got my job in the first place.""
Like many Chinese people who consider Taiwan the long-lost sibling they must see at least once in their lifetime, Mr Xi would want to eventually travel to ""our treasured island"" which is what many Chinese people call Taiwan.
But Mr Ma will not be able to extend the invitation. That would be asking for trouble. Given China's motive for developing stronger ties, Taiwanese not in favour of this would simply use it as a chance to protest, and perhaps throw shoes at Mr Xi.
Mr Ma says the past seven years have brought about the most stable and peaceful period in cross-strait relations in 66 years. One of his hopes before his presidency ends next May is to use these talks to institutionalise meetings between leaders of the two sides so that relations will stay on the right track, and the two sides can have dialogue at the highest level, regardless of which political party comes into power in Taiwan.
But Mr Xi would probably say: ""That all depends on whether the next leader agrees to our condition."" And the condition is to accept that Taiwan and mainland China are part of one China. So far, the candidate tipped to win, Tsai Ing-wen from the pro-independence opposition party, has refused to do that.
It's almost sacrilegious in the shared Chinese culture of Taiwan and China to split the bill in a formal banquet, but at the Singapore dinner, the two sides will have to deal with the awkward moment when the bill comes.
They've decided to split it because not doing so would give the impression that one is a host and the other a guest, and that they are not meeting on an equal level. And that would cause trouble for Mr Ma, because he's facing domestic pressure not to give any suggestion that Taiwan is a lesser, weaker party in the talks.
But while some think Mr Ma shouldn't meet Mr Xi, others believe two former enemies agreeing to talk can only be a good thing. They hope the talks can raise mutual understanding and trust - and perhaps that will happen over a few glasses of Singapore Sling.","On Saturday, for the first time since their bitter split at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, the leaders of China and Taiwan will meet."
"The Family and Childcare Trust (FCT) said the increase in Wales between 2014 and 2015 is far larger than rises in England and Scotland.
It also warned that there is not enough holiday childcare to meet demand.
Welsh councils said they are ""working hard to support families in need of childcare, including during the summer holidays"".
The FCT surveyed local authorities in Wales and found the average price of public sector holiday childcare, such as schemes run by councils or in schools, had risen by 69.9%.
The average increase between 2014 and 2015 across Wales, England and Scotland was 14%.
Jill Rutter, who carried out the survey, said: ""Welsh local authorities have until very recently protected a lot of their public sector childcare.
""In England the cuts started much earlier, back in 2010, now things are really catching up on Welsh local authorities.""
The average price of public sector holiday childcare in Wales is £108.31 a week. The average price in the private sector is £117.13 a week.
The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said it is working with the Welsh government and childcare providers from the voluntary and private sectors to ""consider the issues that parents face in finding accessible and affordable childcare"".
The FCT said 95% of Welsh councils lack sufficient holiday childcare for working parents and not one provides sufficient childcare for disabled children, compared to 87% and 88% of English councils respectively.
A spokesman for the WLGA said: ""Local authorities in Wales carry out childcare sufficiency assessments which highlight any gaps in childcare provision.
""There is, however, no legal obligation for councils to provide their own holiday childcare.""","The cost of council-run school holiday clubs has increased by nearly 70% this year, according to a charity."

"Earlier this year, Stacy Nichols' small electrical business on Queensland's Gold Coast employed six people.
By the time the Australian government announced on 22 October its intention to reduce its support for renewable energy, she was down to just two staff.
""I have a van set up for solar work sitting on the street, with no solar work or staff due to [Prime Minister] Tony Abbott,"" Ms Nichols says.
The many companies, such as Ms Nichols' firm,  that are involved in the burgeoning renewables industry - mostly wind and solar power operators - were devastated by the government's announcement that it would cut its target of generating 41,000 gigawatt hours (GWh) a year of renewable energy by 2020 to 27,000 GWh a year.
The government says the cut in the Renewable Energy Target (RET) takes account of a decline in overall demand for electricity that has been sparked, in part, by higher power prices. It also says the lower target will provide certainty to the renewables sector.
The decision is not as drastic as it could have been. A government-commissioned review by businessman and climate change sceptic Dick Warburton had proposed, as one option, scrapping the RET altogether.
However, the new target still has to make its way through parliament either with the support of the Labor opposition or of a number of independent senators in the Upper House - neither of which is a sure thing.
Until that is settled, businesses such as Ms Nichols' are facing an uncertain future.
""We were growing,"" the mother of two young children said of their family business. ""We were looking to put on more people and get another van.""
Her company, Infinite Lighting & Electrical, decided to specialise in solar electricity work just two years ago as the industry encouraged its members to pursue solar power in a political climate where the sector was supported by an RET entrenched in legislation by the previous Labor government.
Ms Nichols invested heavily in training and certification for her staff.
But months ago, when it became clear the government would cut or dump the target RET, business began to dry up, she says.
It is not only small operators who have been hurt. One of Australia's largest wind turbine tower producers, Keppel Prince Engineering in Victoria, announced last Thursday it had sacked 100 workers because of the government's RET decision.
A number of large-scale renewable energy producers had already been affected by the conservative government's lack of commitment to renewable energy, says the sector's peak body, the Clean Energy Council.
In July, clean energy solutions provider Pacific Hydro cut its staff by 10%; Hydro Tasmania has said the government's scrapping of the carbon tax would significantly cut into profits, and US company, Recurrent Energy, has reportedly closed its Australian office.
The Clean Energy Council says a cut in the RET will kill much of Australia's renewable energy industry, which employs about 21,000 people nationwide.
""A substantial reduction of [the] target to around 27,000 GWhâ€¦ would equate to a 64% reduction in future investment and effectively devastate the renewable energy sector,"" says the council's acting chief executive Kane Thornton, adding that consumers will end up paying higher, not lower power bills because of the cut in supply.
The Australian government's move to ""recarbonise"" does not bode well ahead of global climate talks in Paris next year, says policy think tank the Climate Institute.
""The core risk is that it institutionalises failure by driving up emissions,"" says Climate Institute deputy chief executive, Erwin Jackson.
The European Union has announced it will cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% on 1990 levels by 2030.
Australia, the highest carbon emitter per capita of any country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), has an existing emissions reduction target of at least 5% by the end of this decade.
""We need all countries to be pulling their weight,"" Mr Jackson says.
A decline in Australia's renewable energy generation will take it in the wrong direction, he says.",The Australian government has never hidden its scepticism about climate change or renewable energy but its decision last week to cut support for cleaner energy sources still left the renewable energy industry reeling.
"Up to 30 men, some with false beards and one masquerading as a pregnant woman in a wheelchair, entered the hospital in Hebron overnight.
They took away a suspect in a recent stabbing near Hebron after shooting dead his cousin in an altercation.
Ten Israelis and dozens of Palestinians have been killed in recent unrest.
Many of the Palestinian fatalities were attackers in near-daily stabbings of Israelis, shot by their victims or security forces.
The surge in violence began in September when tensions at a flashpoint holy site in Jerusalem revered by Jews and Muslims boiled over, amid rumours that Israel planned to relax long-standing rules to strengthen Jewish rights at the complex.
Israel has repeatedly denied such claims.
Closed-circuit television footage from al-Ahli hospital showed a large, armed group disguised as Arab men and women making their way down a corridor, pushing the wheelchair, shortly before 04:00 (02:00 GMT).
They point the guns at hospital staff, apparently ordering them to stay back.
Minutes later they are seen making their way back with the suspect, 20-year-old Azzam Shalaldeh, in the wheelchair.
Mr Shalaldeh is alleged to have stabbed and wounded an Israeli on 25 October before escaping after being shot by the victim.
Palestinian officials said Mr Shalaldeh's 27-year-old cousin, Abdallah Azzam Shalaldeh, was shot and killed in Azzam Shalaldeh's hospital room.
Israel's Shin Bet security agency said he was shot after attacking the Israeli forces. Azzam Shalaldeh's brother Bilal, who was also in the room at the time, said Abdallah Azzam Shalaldeh was shot without warning when he emerged from a bathroom.
Shin Bet said Azzam Shalaldeh belonged to ""a family of Hamas militants"", AFP news agency reported.
The Israeli military operates an undercover unit colloquially known as Duvdevan, which sometimes mingle undetected with Palestinians during riots before snatching suspects.

However, the Home Office said it was now reconsidering her case.
On Thursday morning, Miss Santiago was told she was no longer at immediate risk of deportation.

""However, we are not out of the woods yet. But for the first time this week, things are looking hopeful. This could actually turn into a success story with a healthy baby being born in the UK.""
Miss Santiago's fiancé, Simon Ellis, said he feels ""scared and trapped"".
""All I want is a safe birth for my baby,"" he said.
""I don't want a chance for that baby to catch microcephaly and I don't think I should have to take that chance.""
Miss Santiago said: ""I'm feeling a lot of stress. I'm depressed, I can't eat.

"Mr Gulen, who is in self-imposed exile in the US, is accused of establishing and running an ""armed terrorist group"".
He was once an ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan but has now been accused of plotting to overthrow the Turkish government - a claim the cleric strongly denies.
The US is thought to be unlikely to act on any extradition request.
The move comes amid a national crackdown on perceived supporters of the cleric.
Over 20 journalists working for media outlets thought to be sympathetic to the Gulen movement were arrested last weekend.
Eight of them were freed on Friday on the orders of a court in Istanbul. Those released include Ekrem Dumanli, editor-in-chief of Zaman newspaper.
Four others, including a TV station boss, remain in custody.
According to the BBC's Mark Lowen in Istanbul, it was expected that the authorities would go after Mr Gulen after having targeted those linked to him.
While the US and Turkey have an extradition agreement, the warrant is considered to be largely symbolic - and unlikely to be acted upon.
The relationship between Washington and Ankara has grown fractious, though they remain allies.
Mr Erdogan has faced criticism from international leaders and his opponents, who accuse him of authoritarianism and undermining free press.
Many abroad believe that the charges against Mr Gulen are politically motivated.
The wealthy cleric, who operates an international network of schools and businesses, has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.

"The seven-hour standoff started after police tried to execute a warrant for the arrest of Korryn Gaines.
Gaines, who was armed with a shotgun, was shot dead in her apartment while her 5-year-old son watched.
Police said her followers on Facebook encouraged her not to give in.
According to Facebook's policies, accounts can be suspended if law enforcement believe individuals are at risk of harm.
Police Chief Jim Johnson has said their decision to request a de-activation was based upon the fact Gaines had a gun and a child was present during her standoff with officers.
Gaines' social media accounts have been restored. But two videos are missing and are being withheld for violating Facebook's standards - which include a provision against inciting violence.
Videos posted on Gaines' Instagram appear to show her talking to her son during the standoff.
In one clip, Gaines questions her son about the situation unfolding outside, with a police officer visible through her open door.
""What [are the police] trying to do?"" she asks the boy.
""They're trying to kill us,' he replies.
Officers claim Gaines threatened to shoot them if they entered her apartment and that she fired shots several times.

Ms Dormeus believes she might have been able to help calm her and end the situation peacefully had she been allowed to speak with her.
Gaines had a history of mental health problems, including anxiety, her former doctor said in an interview.

Lockheed Martin, which built the jet, said it still plans to show the plane at the Paris Air Show this month.
Air Force officials said F-35 fighter jets at other bases were still in use.
Luke Air Force Base, located northwest of Phoenix, cancelled local flying operations for its F-35A Lightning II aircraft on Friday after five incidents were reported in which pilots experienced hypoxia-like symptoms.
But they continued to be grounded on Monday as the Air Force investigated the issue with pilots, maintenance workers and medical professionals, according to base spokeswoman Major Rebecca Heyse.
The incidents took place between 2 May and Thursday, but in each case the jet's backup oxygen system was successful and the aircraft landed safely.

"When applications closed at midday on Friday, 1,924 people had been sent postal votes, which represents 6.4% of those on the electoral role.
They have until midday on Wednesday to deliver their completed ballot slips, either by post or by hand, to Sir Charles Frossard House.
Wednesday is polling day across the island.
Registrar-general of electors Mark de Garis: ""Anyone on the electoral roll could choose to vote by post and our goal was to make the process as straightforward as possible.
""The popularity of postal voting is increasing... it's important that we continue to make it a quick and easy process.""
Postal voting has been allowed in Guernsey since 1972 and has grown significantly in recent years; 662 in 2000, 1,513 in 2004, 1,386 in 2008 and 1,685 in 2012.",A record number of people have signed up for postal votes ahead of Guernsey's election next week.
"Strachan received the backing of the SFA board last week despite his side sitting fifth place in their World Cup qualifying group.
Speculation had linked Sunderland manager Moyes with the job.
""I don't think there's anybody out there who could do a better job than Gordon Strachan,"" said Moyes, whose side beat Hull City 3-0 on Saturday.
The Scot had been under pressure in the first year of his own four-year contract with the English Premier League club.
But the win over Hull lifts Sunderland above Swansea City and off the bottom of the table.
Moyes has often said that he would like to manage his country at some point but was unhappy to be linked with the role with Strachan still in post.
""Quite rightly so that they kept Gordon on, because he's got a limited group to choose from,"" said the former Everton, Manchester United and Real Sociedad boss.
""I think Scotland did well against England. I think that the score flattered England a little bit.
""And I think Gordon's working with the tools he's got and deserves to be in the position.""
Scotland's 3-0 defeat by the English at Wembley left the Scots six points behind the Group F leaders and four adrift of second-top Slovenia.
However, Ross County winger Chris Burke, who has seven Scotland caps, thinks Strachan's side can still finish second and secure a play-off place.
""The way we have to look at it is - are we going to finish first, or did we think we were going to finish first?"" he told BBC Scotland.
""No, we weren't. Realistically, we were looking at coming second and is that still a possibility? Of course it is.
""It is only four points and the team that are in second are coming next to Hampden and, if we beat them, it is back on.
""One thing about Gordon is he is a fantastic coach and I've learned so much in my game when I was at the age of 30 when he introduced me back into the Scotland squad.""
Former Scotland left-back Gary Naysmith agreed about Strachan's qualities.
""Everybody says on the training pitch, you won't find anyone better,"" said the East Fife manager.
""I've never heard one person say anything bad about Gordon Strachan's coaching.
""I thought there was a lot of optimism from the England game, but I can also understand when you look at the statistics why some of the fans are wanting a change.
""But you hear what David Moyes had to say there - another manager would have the same group of players.
""By Gordon staying, he obviously believes we can still qualify, because I firmly believe that, if he didn't think they could qualify or get into second place, he would have walked out the door.""",David Moyes thinks the Scottish FA did the right thing by retaining Gordon Strachan as national head coach.
"Allan Richards, 53, from Thaxted Road, Birmingham, served with the force for 31 years and is charged with committing the crimes against boys aged 11-18 between 1983 and 2013.
He also faces two counts of misconduct in public office.
West Midlands Police said it had referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
The former officer has been charged with a series of sexual assaults, indecent assaults and sexual touching.
The force said the charges of misconduct in public office related to alleged misuse of police powers to sexually exploit boys while he was a serving police officer.
Mr Richards was a police constable between 1980 and 2011.
He is due to appear at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday.",A former West Midlands Police officer has been charged with more than 30 child sex offences.
"VW was the seventh most criticised firm in a top 10 dominated by energy and chemical companies, according to consultancy Sigwatch.
Shell was the most criticised by campaigners, followed by Monsanto, which makes genetically modified food.
Sigwatch monitored more than 7,500 non-governmental organisations (NGOs).
The campaigners ranged from Greenpeace to Occupy to the consumer advocates Which? and groups focused on very specific issues such as airports expansion.
Singled out for most praise were NestlÃ©, Marks & Spencer and McDonald's.
But it was the increased criticism of VW which was one of the most striking findings, according to Sigwatch.
""Volkswagen didn't even figure as an NGO target in 2014. By 2015 they were the top seven most hated company in the world as far as NGOs went,"" Sigwatch managing director Robert Blood told the BBC.
""It's entirely because of 'Dieselgate',"" he said, as pressure groups relaunched campaigns against greenhouse gas emissions with a new focus on VW.
VW was found in September to have fitted millions of US cars with defeat devices which disguised emission levels in diesel cars.
Half of the top-10 most criticised companies on Sigwatch's list were energy firms, because of ""the elephant in the room - climate change,"" Mr Blood said.
Top was Shell, but TransCanada, ExxonMobil, EDF and BP also featured.
Shell said it would continue to engage with NGOs to ensure a ""high-energy, low carbon, responsible energy future for our planet"".
The ""most sensitive"" companies to NGO concerns were food companies and retailers.
That included M&S, which was praised for its environmental and animal welfare work, Mr Blood said.
""It knows what its customers want and its customers are Greenpeace supporters,"" he said.","German carmaker Volkswagen was one of the ""most disliked"" companies for pressure groups last year following its emissions scandal, a survey has found."

"The vessel has been called the world's best example of a 15th Century ship by archaeologists.
And new evidence has found that the timbers from the ship have been matched to projects built in the Basque region.
It includes new data from medieval buildings in the Araba and Navarra areas of Spain.
""The mystery of the origins of the Newport Ship, the remains of the a remarkably well-preserved medieval ship may at last have been solved,"" said Nigel Nayling, associate professor at University of Wales Trinity Saint David.
""Artefacts found at the time of the discovery hinted at Iberian connections but recent advances in dendrochronology (tree-ring dating) have provided the first scientific evidence.
""The results strongly suggest that the ship was originally built in the Basque Country where wooden shipbuilding has a long tradition.
'Useful insight'
""A Basque origin for the ship has been suspected for some time and collaboration between the scientists was first suggested in 2006 by Xabier Agote, president of the Albaola Society which promotes research into Basque maritime heritage.""
Mr Nayling said initial attempts to date the ship were unsuccessful.
But he added the latest results have come from research programmes sampling both the ship itself and more historic buildings that have allowed extension and improvement of the medieval section of the Basque chronology.
Debbie Wilcox, cabinet member for leisure and culture at Newport City Council said: ""The ship provides an excellent opportunity to tell the story of medieval Newport and its history as an international maritime town long before its development as an industrial port.
""The latest information about the Newport Ship provides a useful insight into its origins and it appears that one of the mysteries of its history may have been solved.""
Newport council has put a tender out to developers asking them to recommend a suitable location for the vessel.
It is seeking a specialist company who would be able to provide a new museum based around the ship's history.",A medieval ship discovered on the banks of the River Usk in Newport in 2002 may have come from the Basque country in Spain.
"Rob Stewart was speaking after plans were unveiled for 3,500-seat arena, an aquarium and a city beach area with bars, restaurants, hotels and homes.
It will be the biggest landscape change since the city was blitzed during World War Two and is expected to lead to about 1,700 permanent jobs.
Swansea council unveiled the plans on Friday with work due to start in 2017.
It comes 10 years after a flagship scheme to redevelop Swansea city centre collapsed.
Mr Stewart said: ""We've been very careful to make sure what we've proposed is deliverable. We're very confident we have the right developers and right funders.""
Two developers - Rivington Land and Acme and Trebor Developments - have been appointed and construction work will bring about 500  jobs.
The main areas to be worked on are the former St David's shopping centre, land next to the leisure centre and the civic centre site.
Mr Stewart added: ""People quite rightly would want to see us get on with this as soon as possible.
""We are already in discussions with Welsh government, with the UK department of trade and industry in London, to make sure we can take these plans forward as quickly as possible.""
It will run from Whitewalls, include a cafe quarter and be built on an incline so that at the other end, people can walk straight over Oystermouth Road to where the arena will be, hosting concerts, shows, conferences and ice skating.
There will also be a high-rise building next to it comprising of a hotel and flats and could become the tallest in Wales.
An access route will run from there to the aquarium and city beach.","A new £500m plan to transform Swansea city centre will succeed, the leader of the city's council has said."
"The archive is making available thousands of items too fragile to go on public display.
There will also be pages on the conservation work carried out by the Jersey Heritage Trust as it tries to preserve the past.
The trust looks after over 350,000 artefacts, works of art and information relating to the island's history.
The website also includes Occupation Archive material which was listed on the UNESCO UK memory of the world register in early 2011.
Linda Romeril, Head of Archives and Collections at Jersey Heritage, said the collections were ""at the heart of what we do and it is our duty to protect and pass on these unique items to future generations"".
""These collections define the Island; they hold the evidence for its historical development and act as the community's memory,"" she said.",Historical documents and works of art held by the Jersey Archive have been published online for the first time.
"It also saw £400m of instant access savings cash being withdrawn in a period that saw it being put up for sale before a rescue deal was agreed.
However, half-year losses narrowed to £135.2m from £177m last year.
In June, the Co-operative Bank agreed a £700m rescue package to stop itself from being wound up.
The bank said that the deal was progressing to plan and was ""on track"" to be completed by September.
The Co-op Bank was rescued from the brink of collapse by a group of hedge funds in 2013, after bad property loans contributed to a £1.5bn hole in its finances.
In February this year, the bank was put up for sale after it was unable to reach a strong enough financial footing to satisfy Bank of England regulations.
However, the sale plan was dropped after its existing investors agreed to a rescue deal, which will see them swap their debt for a stake in the bank. The Co-op Group's stake in the bank will fall from 20% to about 1%.
Chief executive Liam Coleman said the completion of the restructuring would ""secure the future of the Co-operative Bank as a viable stand-alone entity"".
He also said that trading in the first half of the year had been ""resilient"", given the backdrop of the talks over the bank's future.
Although the bank had lost current accounts, the fall was less than 2% of its total, and it still had 1.4 million current account customers.
""The vast majority of customers have remained very loyal as we have progressed the sale and capital raise process and I am extremely grateful for their ongoing support,"" Mr Coleman said.
""Of course there is more hard work ahead, and, like other banks, we recognise there are risks to the UK economy, but this is a great bank and we are positive about the future.""","The Co-operative Bank has said it lost about 25,000 current accounts during the first half of the year amid the uncertainty over its future."
"Residents have said overflow channels would stop short of the Surrey town and water could be funnelled towards them.
The Environment Agency said Sunbury would see benefits from the Â£256m River Thames Scheme and risks would not rise.
Spokesman David Murphy said the channels were to convey water in a channel instead of on the flood plain.
Sunbury resident Kevin Ella said no-one would want to live in the town.
""The houses are not going to be worth any money because people know we're at the end of a flood relief,"" he said.
Fellow resident Jeff Dormer added: ""[It is] very likely [the floods] will happen again. There is no future for us here.""
BBC reporter Gareth Furby said nearby Datchet would see flood levels fall by three quarters of a metre and Wraysbury would see flood levels fall by a third of a metre, but Sunbury had no minimum reduction and a maximum benefit of about 15cm, under the scheme.
Mr Murphy said the whole scheme would benefit more than 15,000 properties along the Thames.
He said: ""The River Thames Scheme includes all communities from Datchet down to Teddington and that includes Sunbury.
""Sunbury will see benefits from the scheme although those benefits will be less than other communities.""
He said there were proposals to develop the scheme to increase the capacity of three weirs and reduce flood levels in Sunbury.
""[But] the amount that we can reduce water levels is limited because of the size of the river as it passes down through Sunbury down to Teddington,"" he stressed.
About 1,000 homes in Surrey were flooded during the winter after the Thames reached its highest level in 60 years.",Homeowners have raised concerns a flood defence scheme for the River Thames could increase the risk to their properties in Sunbury.
"The church at Tabgha is built where Christians believe Jesus performed the miracle of the loaves and fishes, also known as the Feeding of the 5,000.
Hebrew graffiti found on a wall is thought to indicate the attack may have been the work of Jewish extremists.
Police detained 16 teenagers for questioning but later released them.
Spokeswoman Luba Samri told the AFP news agency that they were freed ""with no conditions attached, after being interviewed and giving statements"".
The BBC's Kevin Connolly in Jerusalem says Tabgha is a sacred site to the many thousands of Christian pilgrims who visit the Holy Land every year.
The arson attack on the Church of the Multiplication of the Loaves and Fishes caused extensive damage to a book shop and other buildings at the complex but did not destroy the 5th Century mosaic floors which are its key archaeological feature.
Two people who had been staying at the complex were also taken to hospital suffering from smoke inhalation.
A verse from a Hebrew prayer denouncing the worship of ""idols"" was found spray-painted in red on a wall of the church.
Our correspondents say the graffiti will suggest to many that the attack is part of a sporadic campaign by a small group of right-wing Jewish extremists against non-Jewish targets in Israel, but police said it was too early to tell.
""The torching of the church is a cowardly and despicable act which contradicts Israel's basic values,"" Internal Security Minister Gilad Erdan said in a statement.
The Israeli pressure group, Rabbis for Human Rights, says there have been 43 hate crime attacks on churches, mosques and monasteries in Israel and the occupied West Bank since 2009, Reuters news agency reports.","Arsonists are believed to have started a fire which has damaged a Roman Catholic church on the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel, police say."
"Mohammed Sidique Khan, Shehzad Tanweer and Hasib Hussain, along with a fourth man Germaine Lindsay, detonated bombs in London killing 52 people in 2005.
Qari Asim, of the Leeds Makkah Mosque, said their families were still in ""this sense of shock and disbelief"".
He said an event retracing their steps would take place over the weekend.
Mr Asim, whose mosque is in the Hyde Park area of Leeds, said: ""Ten years on and the Muslim community, and the wider community, we are all still looking for answers, we are all still trying to find out what are the factors and what is the evidence that leads to radicalisation.
""The families of those three men who came from Leeds and blew themselves up in London, they are still looking for answers because to them they would never have imagined that their young men would do something like that and they're still going through this sense of shock and disbelief.""
He said the three were described as ""ordinary young men, they were gentlemen, they were good to talk to, they were very friendly people effectively"", he said.
""How can three young men, living their ordinary lives, become so radicalised? Can be so motivated that they can take their own lives but also take the lives of others?""
This weekend a group of young people from different faiths are to travel from Leeds to London retracing the steps of the three bombers.
The Leeds Peace Ambassadors will undertake a ""peace journey"" to mark the 10th anniversary of the bombings, hoping to inspire unity among different faiths.
Fifty-two people died and hundreds were injured when bombs exploded on three Tubes and a bus.

"Public Health Wales (PHW) officials were responding to Welsh Government plans launched in November.
PHW backed moves to restrict smoking but said ministers should go further.
The body was giving evidence to the assembly's health committee.
The proposals are part of the Welsh Government's second attempt to bring in the Public Health Bill, that does not include a controversial ban on e-cigarettes in some enclosed places.
Ministers hope the legislation will be passed by May.
PHW's submission to the committee said: ""We would suggest that there would need to be a clear definition of 'playground' and that 'schools' should include early years educational settings such as nurseries (private and public).
""In the case of schools and playgrounds this should include the perimeter of these settings otherwise the intended impact of the restrictions is unlikely to be achieved i.e. if parents or other adults are permitted to smoke at the perimeter of a playground or at the school gates in clear view of children this will not impact on the intended goal of 'denormalisation' (reduce smoking being modelled to children as normal behaviour).
""We would also propose that the restrictions should not be limited to hospitals but should include the grounds of premises used predominately for the delivery of healthcare to include community health facilities and primary care.""
Currently, the Welsh Government plans to ban smoking within five meters of playground equipment ""due to this being beyond the distance of potential second hand smoke harm from a single cigarette, plus an additional buffer to protect against weather elements"".
On Wednesday, PHW Director of Health Improvement Dr Julie Bishop told the committee that a broader definition of a ""playground"" was needed.
""If we're narrowing that definition to, literally be play equipment; so I presume by that we mean things like slides and swings and those kind of things, that's actually quite a small area of what most of us would consider to be playgrounds in the broader sense,"" she said.
""So I would encourage playing fields and sports grounds to be included in that definition.""","Plans to ban smoking in school and hospital grounds and playgrounds in Wales should also extend to outside all nurseries, GP practices, playing fields and sports grounds, a health promotion body has told AMs."
"The victims were Nepali nationals on their way to the Canadian embassy where they worked as security guards.
The attacker waited for the bus as it left a compound, police said.
The blast was followed by a separate bomb attack on a market in Badakhshan province that killed at least eight people and wounded 18.
The Taliban said they carried out the Kabul bombing, the first such attack since the start of the holy month of Ramadan.
The bomb went off shortly before 06:00 local time (01:30 GMT) on a main road leading out of the capital towards the city of Jalalabad.
The guards were employed by a private security company, an official told AFP news agency. At least eight other people were injured.
The incident follows a suicide attack on a bus near Kabul last month and an attack on a court in Ghazni in June. Both attacks were claimed by the Taliban in revenge for the execution of six prisoners.
The Taliban have been waging an insurgency against the government since 2001. Nato ended its combat mission in December 2014, although about 13,000 training and counter-terrorism troops remain in Afghanistan.
Peace efforts have stalled after the Taliban refused to participate in new talks with the Afghan government until foreign forces had left the country.","A suicide attack on a minibus in Kabul has killed at least 14 people and injured several more, Afghan authorities say."
"Eighteen men, aged between 19 and 29 and some in prison, are banned from parts of Birmingham and must register phones and vehicles with police.
The two-year orders aim to disrupt gang-related violence between the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew.
West Midlands Police said it was ""a landmark ruling"".
The orders follow a spate of firearms offences in the city in 2015 and 2016, but the gangs have struck fear across parts of Birmingham for many years.
They gained notoriety in 2003 when their violent feud claimed the lives of two girls - Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis - outside a late-night new year party in the city. Four men were later jailed for life for their murders.
The gangs have also been behind countless drive-by shootings, drug dealing, intimidation, robberies and kidnappings.
After more recent incidents of gun crime in the city, West Midlands Police and the council sought to secure the injunctions in a civil case heard at Birmingham Crown Court earlier this year.
The force secured interim injunctions in 2016 and said at the time it did not want to identify anyone until they were permanent.  The BBC revealed their names after obtaining the county court documents.
More than 80 people from the Home Office and police gave evidence between February and June ahead of the orders being granted in July, which the force has revealed for the first time now.
Two have already been issued, three men are being sought by police and three properties were visited by officers on Wednesday.
The men are forbidden from associating with each other and entering the city centre, Handsworth, Newtown, Winson Green and Lozells.
In a copy of an injunction seen by the BBC, gang members are also banned from appearing in music videos that include material linked to the Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew. One such music video was shown during the court proceedings.
Ten other men will receive the orders in jail where restrictions will be imposed on certain visitors to limit any gang associations, police said.
Among those to be given the injunctions in prison are two men believed to have been the ""armed response"" faction of the Burger Bar Boys.
Reial Phillips, 21, from Winson Green was jailed for 27 years last year after seven people were injured in a series of shootings during a feud with members of the Johnson Crew.
His co-defendant 23-year-old Ashai Gray, from Walsall, was jailed for nine years after admitting conspiracy to supply cocaine and heroin.
Police said their actions ""brought fear"" to people in the West Midlands.
Gang injunctions came into force in England and Wales in 2011. Home Office figures show that between January 2011 and January 2014, 88 had been put in place.
The first one issued in the West Midlands was in 2012.
But solicitor Errol Robinson, who represented two of the four men jailed for the new year murders, criticised the move.
""They don't change behaviour or address underlying issues,"" he said.
""Injunctions become a bit of a trophy and encourage rebellion. Gang members like to show that they're not listening to orders so will breach orders.
""It's a cheap way of trying to solve crime but there is no evidence to suggest that they work.
""They're just a cosmetic gesture to show people that something is being done about gangs - but actually the results are minimum to none.""
From former gang members the BBC has spoken to, there is little support for the mechanism, BBC Midlands Correspondent Sima Kotecha said.
She said a number of gang members had said that if a person is banned from going to a certain part of a city, they will just go somewhere else and find others who have the same goal of causing violence and disruption.
Birmingham has seen another spike in gun and knife crime in 2017, with nine fatal stabbings this year. None of the men named in the injunctions are involved, police said.
Det Sgt Ian Comfort said: ""This is relatively new legislation and we believe that securing final full injunctions on such a large number of gang members is a UK first.
""The injunctions are applied for in the civil court in addition to sentences handed out by the criminal court for offences. They are an additional measure to help control the offenders and keep the community safe.""
Supt Mat Shaer, neighbourhood policing superintendent for Birmingham, said the injunctions were ""not sought lightly"" and the police, council and other groups had already made ""exhaustive efforts with these men"" and their families to try and steer them away gang culture.
Organised gangs in Birmingham have been a part of the city's life since the 1870s. Some have been mythologised on TV such as the Peaky Blinders.
But today's gangs linked to guns and drugs are far from glamorous and bring terror and misery to many people's lives.
The names Burger Bar Boys and Johnson Crew sprang on to the crime scene in the late 1990s.
Chaotic and quick to wreak violence, their crimes reached a crescendo one night at a new year's party in 2003 when two innocent teenage girls, Letisha Shakespeare and Charlene Ellis, died in a spray of machine gun fire in a drive-by shooting as members of the Burger Bar Boys attempted to kill a Johnson Crew man stood outside a Birmingham party.
That shocking display of gang callousness led to a concerted effort by government, police and the city council, and 10 years later it led some to believe that the gangs had been defeated as gun crime fell dramatically.
But in the last 18 months, a new generation of would-be gang members have arisen and shootings have begun to surge upwards.
Even in the last few weeks, the police have been shot at as they carried out an anti-gun operation in the Ladywood area of the city.
The men made subject to the injunctions",Two rival criminal groups have been hit with what police describe as the largest ever gang injunction.
"The logo, called Harmonized Chequered Emblem, replaces the first choice which was thrown out last year after the designer was accused of plagiarism.
The designer denied stealing the idea.
Organisers said the new design used traditional Japanese colours and patterns to represent the intercultural themes of the Games.
""It incorporates the message of 'unity in diversity',"" they said, and the idea that the Games ""seek to promote diversity as a platform to connect the world"".
When designer Asao Tokolo found out he had won the re-opened contest he said ""my mind has gone blank"".
""I put a lot of time and effort into this design as though it was my own child.""
The first design was rejected after Belgian artist Olivier Debie alleged it copied his design for a theatre logo.
The Games organising committee never agreed to the allegation of plagiarism but said there were too many doubts over the emblem for it to be used.
The logo dispute came shortly after Tokyo decided to scrap the designs for the main Olympic stadium because of spiralling construction costs.
A cheaper design, by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma, was chosen in December last year.",Japan's Olympic organisers have unveiled the new official logos of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games.
"Cook made only a single as England lost to Sri Lanka by 90 runs to trail 4-2 with one match remaining on Tuesday.
Asked if he expected to be captain when England travel down under next month, first of all for a tri-series against Australia and India, he said: ""Yes.
""It's tough at the moment. I'm a better player than I'm showing at the moment, and I've just got to keep going.""
The skipper has now scored 499 runs at an average of 24.95 - with only one half century - in his last 21 ODIs, during which time England have won only eight matches.
""Not scoring the runs I'd like is not a great place to be as a captain,"" said Cook, who has scored five ODI centuries in 91 one-day international appearances.
Four of those hundreds have been as skipper, but the most recent came against West Indies in June 2012.
""You want to lead from the front, and when it's not happening for you it is incredibly frustrating,"" he said.
Cook's difficult day began when he dropped key Sri Lanka batsman Kumar Sangakkara on 41 and the left-hander went on to make 112.
""Days like these don't make the job any easier,"" he said.
""It's probably a good job I'm off a lot of social media and in the middle of Sri Lanka at the moment where the internet is not so great.""
Meanwhile, England coach Peter Moores said the situation would be assessed after the completion of the Sri Lanka series.
""It would be wrong of me as a selector and coach not to review things at the end of this series,"" Moores told Sky Sports.
""Alastair's in a tough patch at the moment but he's working extremely hard to get out of that.""
After Tuesday's final match in Colombo, England have only four guaranteed matches in the triangular series against Australia and India next month before their World Cup campaign begins against co-hosts Australia on 14 February.
Moores also defended Eoin Morgan, who was out first ball in Pallekele on Saturday and has made only one fifty in his last 18 ODI innings.
""I think Morgan's playing well. He got a beauty today. He plays a style of cricket that aggressive and can win matches,"" he said.
""Australia is a place where he has performed well in the past.
""We'll try and pick a 15 for the tri-series that will be the team for the World Cup. You want your side settled by the time you get to that stage.""",Alastair Cook has vowed to remain England one-day captain despite losing a fourth successive one-day series.
"Stephen O'Brien told reporters during a visit to Damascus that the targeting of non-combatants in the country's war was ""unlawful, unacceptable and must stop"".
He was ""particularly appalled"" by government air strikes on a rebel-held suburb of the capital on Sunday.
Activists said on Monday that the death toll from the attack on a market in Douma had risen to at least 96.
That would make it one of the bloodiest single incidents of the four-year-long conflict, which has so far left more than 250,000 people dead.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council has backed a new peace talks proposal from the organisation's Syria envoy, Staffan de Mistura, in a rare show of unity on a topic that has divided members.
Mr de Mistura's plan involves inviting the various Syrian parties to hold talks at working groups in September, as a step towards implementing the roadmap to peace adopted by world powers in 2012 that calls for the formation of a transitional government
A Syrian military source told the Reuters news agency that in its strikes on Sunday the air force had targeted the headquarters of the rebel group, Jaysh al-Islam (Army of Islam).
State television also reported that rebels had shelled a government-held district of the northern city of Aleppo on Monday, killing 10 people and wounding 17.
Mr O'Brien called on both sides to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law at the end of a three-day visit to Syria, his first to the country since becoming the UN's under-secretary general for humanitarian affairs in May.
""I am absolutely horrified by the total disregard for civilian life by all parties in this conflict,"" he said. ""Attacks on civilians are unlawful, unacceptable and must stop.""
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based group that monitors the conflict, said that in Sunday's raid on Douma air force jets fired at least 10 rockets at the town's central market before attacking again after rescue workers arrived.
One video said to be of the aftermath showed a marketplace completely destroyed with surrounding buildings in ruins and vehicles on fire.
Turkey has said it plans to set up a ""safe zone"" for civilians across its border with Syria - policed by ""moderate"" Syrian forces - who would thwart attacks by the government or Islamic State militants.
But Mr O'Brien questioned the use of such buffer areas, saying any country which established them would have to ""accept responsibility"" for guaranteeing people's safety.
""Otherwise very vulnerable people could flock to such safe zones only to find that they've put themselves in more harm's way,"" he told the BBC.
A report by Amnesty International published last week accused the Syrian government of committing war crimes against the 163,000 people living under siege in Douma and other towns in the Eastern Ghouta agricultural belt around Damascus.
Between January and June 2015, government forces carried out at least 60 aerial attacks on the area, killing some 500 civilians, the report said.
The international community has also strongly condemned the air raids.
Mr O'Brien also condemned rival armed groups for cutting off the water supply in Damascus and Aleppo in recent days, affecting at least seven million people.
""It is unacceptable for those engaged in conflict to use access to water and other services as a weapon of war,"" he said.
The British diplomat noted that the UN and its partners were providing assistance to millions of Syrians in need, but he added: ""I remain extremely concerned for the welfare of the 4.6 million people stuck in hard-to-reach and besieged areas.""
He also expressed concern at the lack of funding for the humanitarian operation in Syria and its neighbours, which is less than 30% funded.","The UN's humanitarian chief has said he is ""horrified"" by the attacks on civilians taking place in Syria."
"The four-match contest should have begun in Brisbane on Thursday, but that Test will now start on 17 December.
The traditional Melbourne Boxing Day Test is unchanged, but the Sydney Test is put back three days to 6 January.
The changes have been made because of welfare concerns for Australia's players grieving for Hughes, 25, whose funeral will take place on Wednesday.
The left-handed Australia opener died on Thursday after being struck on the neck by a ball during a domestic Sheffield Shield match.
The funeral service will take place in the sports hall of Macksville High School, which Hughes attended, and will be broadcast live in Australia and on big screens at the Sydney Cricket Ground and Adelaide Oval.
""Nobody should underestimate just what these players are going through right now,"" said Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland.
""These are difficult days and we need to support them in dealing with their grief. It's very clear that playing a Test right now is just too soon and we are reacting accordingly.
""While this wasn't done by design, it is somewhat fitting that the first Test will take place in Adelaide at Phillip's adopted home ground where we hope the match can be a seen as a celebration of his life.""
The India squad, currently in Adelaide, were supposed to fly to Brisbane on Monday but missed their flight.
Their two-day warm-up match against a Cricket Australia XI in Adelaide, scheduled for Friday and Saturday last week, was cancelled.
It has been reported that the Indians may now play a tour game in Adelaide on Thursday and Friday.
After the Test series with India, Australia then face the tourists in a triangular one-day international series that also involves England.
Two of those games have already been switched.
Australia and England will now open the series in Sydney on 16 January, with the Aussies taking on India in Melbourne two days later.",Australia's Test series with India will now begin in Adelaide on 9 December following the death of Phillip Hughes.
"Drivers said a safety device, known as ""a dead man's handle"", failed to activate and stop their trams.
Tram Operations Ltd, which runs the line, said driver fatigue was monitored and controls were ""fully functional"".
An interim report into November's crash suggested the tram was speeding and the driver may have ""lost awareness"".
It found there was no emergency braking and the tram had been travelling at 46mph before it crashed in a 13mph zone, near the Sandilands Junction area of Croydon.
However, a BBC investigation for the Victoria Derbyshire programme, has found that at least three trams have been recorded speeding on that same line since the derailment.
One was travelling at 40mph in a 25mph zone. Another is understood to have been speeding near the crash site.
Four current and former drivers have also admitted they have fallen asleep while driving a tram.
Konrad Turner, who retired last year after driving trams in Croydon for 16 years, said he woke up 10 metres after passing the line's George Street stop, adding: ""A person was very fortunate that I didn't run them over.""
Mr Turner said his tram's driver safety device - which is used on different types of tram across the UK and Europe - failed to work.
Drivers have to apply 1.5lb of pressure on a lever and push it forward for the tram to accelerate.
If pressure is not maintained, a safety device inside the lever should activate - sounding an alarm and then applying an emergency brake.
There is no suggestion a problem with this device was responsible for the derailment at Sandilands.
Guidance from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) safety regulator says the driver safety device should activate ""in the event of driver collapse"".
Further guidance also states the device should be designed ""so that it cannot be kept in the operating position other than by a vigilant tram driver"".
But six drivers said the device was not ""fit for purpose"".
One said drivers were afraid to tell management about safety device failures because they feared being sacked over falling asleep.
""You're asking somebody to come forward and admit to something that could cost them their job,"" he said, adding that he believed most drivers had fallen asleep at some point in the career.
The BBC has uncovered three incidents in the past decade where drivers were incapacitated.
They include a near head-on collision, a collision with buffers, and a driver failing to slow down at the line's Morden Road stop.
On that occasion, the driver was only woken when he was spotted by ticket inspectors on the platform, who radioed his cab.
In November, footage released by the Sun showed a driver who appeared to be asleep for at least 30 seconds continuing to power a tram on the line.
Transport for London told the BBC the driver safety device failed to work because the driver had not completely lost consciousness.
""If he were to completely pass out and lose consciousness then he would relax his grip,"" director Leon Daniels said when shown the footage.
Another driver told the BBC of a dead man's handle failure in May 2016.
He said a spring in the device had broken, causing the alarm and emergency braking to be initially delayed, before failing altogether.
The driver told the BBC he reported it immediately. He said he was told it was safe to continue.
""[I said] if I have a heart attack or become unconscious this tram will go through the buffers at Beckenham junction at 50mph and kill more than likely myself, the majority of people on board and around the tram.
""Only when I said that [did they say], 'Take it out of service straightaway.'""
In a statement, Tram Operations Ltd, said there was not ""a full failure"" of the driver's safety device and passengers ""were not at risk"".
It says the tram was later ""examined"" and the fault was rectified the next day.
Transport for London said the ""tram was still operating safely"".
The Office of Rail and Road (ORR) safety regulator said it was not made aware of the incident, but a ""failure should be reported"".
When questioned on allegations of trams exceeding speed limits in Croydon, Tram Operations said it had increased speed checks across the tram network since the crash.

"But it's 13 years since he left the television series and since then he's carved a hugely successful career in the theatre.
His new stage show is about the reggae legend Bob Marley. But he insists, it is ""absolutely not"" a jukebox musical, where the songs take precedence over the plot.
Kwei-Armah, the writer and director of One Love, The Bob Marley Musical, says it is not ""sing-a-long-a-Bob"", but ""a play with music"".
He admitted though that it was a ""delicate"" balancing act trying to keep in enough songs the audience will recognise.
So hits including No Woman No Cry, Jamming, Three Little Birds and Redemption Song are among 30 tracks that feature in the show.
But One Love is not your usual musical hero, womb to tomb story.
Instead it focuses on just three years in Marley's life and career, which Kwei-Armah says are ""very significant"" in ""understanding the hero's journey of the man.""
Following an assassination attempt in 1976, the singer left his home in Jamaica and went to live in London in self imposed exile.
While in England he recorded two of his biggest albums: Exodus and Kaya.
Kwei-Armah said he wanted to get inside the mind of the man at that time and ""show a side of Bob that we don't often speak about.""
""Bob being a political songwriter, I wanted to look at what were the years when he was tested. What were the years when he might have doubted himself? And I found these years to be that.""
Marley died of cancer in 1981 at the age of 36.
But interest in him shows no sign of diminishing. It is estimated he has sold more than 50 million albums around the world. Time declared Exodus the best album of the 20th Century in 1999. The same year the BBC named One Love the song of the millennium.
His Facebook page has more than 70 million fans - and Marley is in the top 15 most popular pages on the social media site.
For many, Bob Marley is an idol - a civil rights activist who spoke up for the poor and oppressed.
But he was not a saint. And Kwai-Armah says he does not gloss over Marley's womanising and drug use.
He says he portrays him ""warts and all"". He adds: ""I don't need any hero to be an angel.""
The singer Mitchell Brunings is playing the title role.
Born in Surinam, but raised in The Netherlands, he was a backing vocalist in a Marley tribute band, before entering the Dutch equivalent of the television talent show, The Voice.
He sang Redemption Song and his performance went viral on YouTube.
As a result, Kwai-Armah cast him in the lead role. It is his UK stage debut and he is feeling the pressure to do Marley justice.
""He has a very big following, a lot of his followers are fanatical about their devotion to him, which I understand because I am one of his followers myself. I don't want to do anything to damage his image.""
Marley's family has already given the show their blessing.
His daughter Cedella has said: ""Birmingham is a natural place for its UK premiere. With its great mix of cultures, it's a city where my father performed to audiences that were captivated by his presence.
""We have no doubt that telling the story through music to a new generation in Birmingham will be part of his continuing legacy.""
One Love: The Bob Marley Musical opens at the Birmingham Repertory Theatre on 10th March.

"The decision by ministers overturns a recommendation from a Scottish government reporter that the Pentland Studios Project should be thrown out.
Midlothian Council had failed to make an initial ruling on the application.
PSL Land Ltd said it was ""very pleased"" with the decision and hoped the first studio facilities would be operational by late 2018.
The studio is earmarked for a site at Old Pentland Farm, near Straiton.
The Association of Film and Television Practitioners Scotland (AFTPS) had called on ministers to back a new studio.
PSL land Ltd said: ""PSL Land Ltd are very pleased with today's decision by ministers to approve the grant of planning permission in principle for Scotland's world-class Film & TV studio complex, and will be moving forward immediately with the application for planning permission in detail for the Film Studio, Academy and Energy Centre sections of the development.
""Working together with Midlothian Council, PSL hope this next stage will be expedited accordingly, recovering the construction scheduling that will enable delivery of the key Studio operation by late 2018.
""It is anticipated that a detailed schedule to progress the planning application will be agreed with Midlothian Council in the next few weeks, producing a phased timeframe with the Studio, Academy and Energy Centre as the first buildings to be progressed to full planning consent.""

"Hull keeper Eldin Jakupovic saved two penalties after the hosts had played the whole of extra time with 10 men following Dieumerci Mbokani's dismissal.
Newcastle had taken the lead in extra time when Mohamed Diame prodded home Vurnon Anita's cross to score against his former club.
The lead lasted a minute, Robert Snodgrass equalising after Matz Sels had spilled Markus Henriksen's shot into his path.
Mbokani was sent off in the 89th minute for lunging forward with his head at Jamaal Lascelles.
The tie only came to life in extra time, the first 90 minutes featuring just two shots on target.
Newcastle have now lost nine of their 10 penalty shootouts in all competitions, yet Rafael Benitez's side will be wondering why they did not win the tie in 120 minutes.
They had 32 shots in that time, but their finishing was as wayward as their penalties.
Jonjo Shelvey set the tone for Newcastle's spot-kick nightmare when his attempt was kept out by Jakupovic.
Hull's first penalty fell to Snodgrass and he made no mistake, before Dwight Gayle hit the bar with his attempt for Newcastle.
Skipper Michael Dawson made it 2-0 before Christian Atsu scored for Newcastle.
Tom Huddlestone made it 3-1, and Hull's players and fans were celebrating a first EFL Cup semi-final appearance when Jakupovic kept out Yoan Gouffran's tame attempt.
Hull had just one shot on target in normal time, and their hopes of reaching the semi-finals looked over when Mbokani was sent off.
The forward, on loan from Dynamo Kiev, kicked out and pushed Lascelles before lunging forward at the Newcastle defender with his head.
The 31-year-old has appeared in five league games since arriving at the end of August.
He now faces a three-match ban - something Hull could do without as they look to climb away from the Premier League relegation zone.
Hull City boss Mike Phelan: ""This is the furthest the club has ever been and the players are really pleased.
""For this football club, it's a tremendous achievement. Hopefully we can go one step further now.""
Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez: ""The way that we played we deserved to score goals in the first half and in extra time. Then when we did score the goal we didn't manage the situation.
""It's something you learn with experience. Maybe we will do a little better the next time we have this many chances.""

"South and West Yorkshire would both control some tax and spending if local councils devolve powers to new combined authorities run by a mayor.
Under the proposals, strategic planning, transport and economic regeneration powers would be handed over.
The Chancellor, George Osborne, could announce the plan on Wednesday.
The five West Yorkshire councils - Bradford, Calderdale, Kirklees, Leeds and Wakefield - joined the neighbouring City of York in North Yorkshire to form a combined authority six months ago.
Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield councils have created a similar South Yorkshire body.
The existing councils would continue to run services such as education and waste management individually.
Under the current agreement one of the council leaders is chosen by the others to chair the combined authority.
The chancellor's idea takes this on much further with extra powers for the combined authority to control social welfare policy, raise tax and control public spending. In return leadership would be given to a new generation of ""metro mayors"" wielding considerable executive powers.
Councillor Peter Box, Labour leader of Wakefield City Council and current chair of the West Yorkshire Combined Authority, said he would welcome any extra power and budgets but totally reject a regional executive mayor.
Wakefield, Bradford, Leeds and Sheffield all rejected individual city mayors in referendums just two years ago.
""Just a couple of weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was in Leeds and told us that we could have the devolved powers without having to accept an executive mayor,"" said Mr Box.
""Go on any street and it becomes clear the public will simply not accept another elected politician.""
Andrew Carter, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on Leeds City Council, voted against creating a local executive mayor in the 2012 referendums.
""But, a metro mayor is a completely different proposition,"" he said.
Support for the idea has come from two of Bradford's MPs.
Gerry Sutcliffe, Labour MP for Bradford South, who was leader of the city council before being elected to parliament, says West Yorkshire has to follow the Manchester lead or it will see potential investment and economic growth being sucked over to the other side of the Pennines.
George Galloway, Respect MP for Bradford West, said he believed that West Yorkshire could reap the same benefits that have resulted from the strong leadership of London's mayors.
""We have had two now, both of them bigger-than-life figures, who have clearly made a difference to London,"" he said.
The individual councils would not enter into a formal merger. A similar arrangement has been announced for Greater Manchester's 10 councils.
""I am a great believer in the power of our cities to be big forces in the world,"" Mr Osborne said as he signed the deal with the Greater Manchester councils in November.
""Great cities like Manchester don't quite have a strong enough voice. And I want to improve that. I think you do that by having a directly elected mayor. I think that has worked in London"".",Parts of Yorkshire could be run by a London-style directly-elected mayor if new plans are proposed in the government's Autumn Statement.
"The investigation by the Press Association news agency found some are now charging £4 for a one-hour stay.
It showed most trusts did not increase their charges, but the average rise among the third that did was 15%.
The analysis combines figures obtained from NHS trusts and data submitted to statistics body NHS Digital.
The most expensive trust in the country for a one-hour stay is the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, where patients are forced to pay £4 for any stay up to two hours.
Deputy chief executive Alf Turner said the charge was necessary to cover running costs and fund the expansion of the car park that is taking place.
""I do not like having to charge people for car parking and in an ideal world we would not have to,"" he added.
At the other end of the scale, car parking at Trafford General Hospital in Greater Manchester is free for up to three hours.
Some trusts allow patients and visitors to park for free for the first 30 minutes before charges start.
But others have scrapped cheaper charges for short stays, meaning people have to pay a flat fee covering up to three hours even if they are only staying for 45 minutes.
Of the 209 hospital trusts that reported figures to NHS Digital for both 2014/15 and 2015/16, a third showed an increase in their average charge for a three-hour stay.
Some 60% showed no change over the year, while 7% showed a decrease.
Some 38% also said they also charged for disabled parking.
England is the only part of the UK where hospitals routinely charge patients and visitors for parking.
Laura Keely, campaigns manager at Macmillan Cancer Support, said charges are particularly unfair on cancer patients. ""They often need to make frequent trips to hospital. They should not be left out of pocket in order to receive life-saving treatment.""
Some NHS trusts offer concessions to visitors whose loved one is terminally ill and also discounts or weekly tickets for lengthy courses of treatment.
Last December, figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the Press Association revealed that some NHS trusts are making more than £3m a year from car parking fees.
Of more than 90 trusts that responded to the FoI request, half were making at least £1m a year.","A third of hospital trusts in England have increased their car parking charges in the last year, it is being reported."
"They are seeking guarantees of his total co-operation with the forthcoming abuse inquiry in Northern Ireland.
They want to ensure, via him, ""the unconditional co-operation from the orders who ran institutions where children were placed"".
The inquiry will consider allegations dating back to 1945.
Margaret McGuckin, of Savia, said she was abused at a Sisters of Nazareth orphanage in Belfast from the age of three.
She said they would be asking Cardinal Brady to apply pressure on religious orders to co-operate.
""This has been a long and tortuous route for some survivors and victims, re-awakening and reliving memories that were nightmares for some,"" she said.
""We believe that the cardinal holds a key position that will allow that nightmare to end.
""We have been led up the garden path so many times, it was just about story telling.""
""We need to know they are going to support and make a commitment. We need follow-up meetings. We need them to admit rather than pushing people like their lawyers in front of us.
""Are they going to be genuine and Christian in their attitude?""
Representatives of five religious orders where institutional abuse is alleged to have happened are also at the meeting which began at about 11:00 GMT on Monday.
Cardinal Brady came out to welcome the group at his private residence in Armagh. At lunch-time, the meeting was still going on.
Savia campaigned for the NI Executive to hold an inquiry into historical institutional abuse. Final preparations for this are being made by the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister.
It is understood that one part of that process will begin in the next few months.
This is where people are given the opportunity to describe what happened to them in private.
However, the second part of the inquiry, the statutory process, involves a change in Northern Ireland's law which will have to pass through the assembly. This will require more time.
The executive inquiry will include Catholic religious orders, state and voluntary groups.
It follows lengthy judicial examinations of horrifying tales of abuse in the Irish Republic.",The Northern Ireland Survivors and Victims of Institutional Abuse group (Savia) are meeting Catholic primate Cardinal Sean Brady.
"Militants from the group swept virtually unopposed into large swathes of the country, including the second city Mosul, in June 2014.
Their gradual expulsion from Iraq seems at the moment to be almost a matter of time, albeit a good deal of time.
Territory that was lost in a day or two is taking many months to claw painfully back.
If that process continues and the militants are defeated, the way Iraq fits together - if it does - will be decided by who pushes them out, and how the resulting vacuum is filled.
The IS fighters were able to lodge so easily in the Sunni Arab heartlands because the people there had been largely alienated by the sectarian policies and practices of the Shia Arab-dominated Baghdad government under Nouri al-Maliki, who was finally prised out of the prime minister's office in August 2014.
Precious little has been done since then to foster national reconciliation and make the Sunnis, a powerful minority under Saddam Hussein, feel they are full partners in a national project.
Legislation to empower the Sunnis by devolving security and financial responsibilities to the provinces has not happened.
Nor have measures to reverse the persecution of former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, or the random arrests, detentions, and to assuage other Sunni grievances.
While slow progress is being made to drive IS back, many argue that military victory alone is not enough.
""Unless there's political reconciliation, we'll have IS back again five years down the line,"" a senior diplomat warned.
It happened before, so the historical lesson is there, and not so long ago.
The predecessor of IS, al-Qaeda in Iraq, was driven out of the mainly Sunni western province of Anbar from 2006, after the local tribes were induced to switch sides and fight alongside the US and Iraqi militaries against the militants.
But promises of employment and empowerment were not kept. Mr Maliki's policies so angered many Sunnis that the terrain was soon ready for the militants to move back in from refuges in Syria.
The US, who have about 3,500 military personnel training and advising Iraqi government forces on the ground, also seems to be aware that military muscle is not enough.
""We can't just kill our way out of this one,"" said Col Steve Warren, spokesman in Baghdad for the US-led international coalition against IS.
""We need good governance, a peace settlement in Syria, and other things to fall into place.""
Neither of those elements is currently available. But the fight against IS goes on, and looks set to be stepped up.
There is a strong feeling that the Americans are pushing for a major victory such as the recapture of Mosul and possibly Raqqa in Syria - IS's self-declared ""capital"" - as a legacy item before President Barack Obama bows out in January.
But even if initially successful, such an ambitious project, indeed, any further moves to oust IS, could go badly wrong if the foundations are not sound.
Mosul is an almost wholly Sunni city with a population of about two million.
Some residents may still see IS - about 85% of whose fighters in Iraq are believed to be Iraqi - as their protectors against an Iranian-backed, Shia-dominated Baghdad government.
But even without that, if the city is destroyed and occupied by outsiders such as Kurds, Shia militias, or US-backed Iraqi army forces, the seeds of resentment and another militant resurgence could be sown.
The success of military moves against IS so far gives mixed portents.
When the Iraqi army collapsed like a house of cards in the face of the IS eruption in June 2014, it was a motley array of hastily-assembled Shia irregulars, loosely banded into the Hashd al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) that prevented the militants reaching Baghdad.
They also spearheaded the ""liberation"" of the first province to be largely cleared of IS fighters, Diyala, north-east of the capital, a mixed region with a patchwork of Sunnis, Shia, Kurds and others.
Only now, a year later, are Sunni families being encouraged to return, and very much under the aegis of the Shia armed factions.
When a ceremony was staged recently in the town of Udhaim to welcome hundreds of Sunni families back, it was attended by senior Iraqi army and police officers, and by Sunni tribal sheikhs.
But there was no doubt about who was the star of the show: Hadi al-Ameri, whose Iranian-backed Badr Organisation is one of the lynchpins of the Hashd, which clearly calls the shots in the province despite army and police presences.
In nearby Salahuddin province, less mixed and more Sunni, the picture is essentially the same.
In its capital Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's old hometown, some 80% of the largely Sunni population is believed to have returned.
But they now live under the flags and banners of the Shia militias who are still there, some of them accused of stealing cars and kidnapping for ransom - a growing phenomenon in the Shia areas of Baghdad and elsewhere where they also proliferate.
Although there is some attempt to set up a Sunni Hashd in Tikrit, disgruntled Sunnis say it is controlled by the Shia, so recruitment is low.
""Shia militias are everywhere, but there is not a single group of armed Sunnis in Baghdad, Diyala or Salahuddin,"" grumbled one senior Sunni politician.
""That leaves IS as the only Sunni militia.""
But the template was quite different for the latest blow against IS: the recapture last month of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar province.
A Sunni stronghold, Ramadi, fell to IS last May, after the Iraqi army collapsed again.
This time, the campaign to recapture it was spearheaded not by Shia militias, but by government forces backed by coalition air strikes.
The main shock troops were the elite units of the Iraqi Counter-Terrorism Service, a US-trained outfit answering directly to the prime minister.
Iraqi army and police forces filled in, and Sunni tribal fighters also played a role.
""Make no mistake, the recapture of Ramadi was a turning point in this campaign,"" exulted the commander of coalition forces, Lt-Gen Sean McFarland.
""The enemy suffered devastating losses and the Iraqi Security Forces have proven themselves capable of defeating Daesh [IS], even when the enemy has all the advantages of prepared defence in an urban area.""
It was a testing-ground for a narrative other than that of the Iranian-backed Shia militias, who were held back, although they say they played an important role in securing springboard bases for the offensive.
Ramadi gave a boost to the embattled Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi.
He has scant support even from his own Shia Daawa party, and is seen across the board by Sunni, Shia and Kurdish politicians as weak, hesitant, lacking in leadership and unable to stand up to the militias.
But there was a down-side to the Ramadi victory too: heavy destruction, and the displacement of the entire population.
""It's completely destroyed, and the people have been displaced and mistreated, dealt with like IS suspects,"" said a disgruntled Sunni politician.
""People inside Mosul and Falluja [another IS-controlled city in Anbar] will be asking: 'What did you get?' Military operations are useless unless you make people feel they're first-class citizens.
""Unless there's an internal revolt from inside Mosul, people will feel this is not the army of Iraq, it's just another army killing more Sunnis.""
Nor can the formula that finally and slowly worked in Ramadi simply be applied at Mosul. It took government forces with coalition backing seven months to regain Ramadi. Mosul is 10 times bigger.
""Neither the army, nor the police, nor the Hashd, nor the tribes, can do Mosul on their own,"" said Hadi al-Ameri of the Badr organisation.
""We have to work together as one cohesive team, in co-ordination also with the [Kurdish] Peshmerga forces, to mobilise the whole nation to defeat IS.""
He omitted to mention coalition air support, which would also clearly be crucial to the campaign.
Some Iraqi analysts believe outside ground forces would also be needed. US military leaders, while reticent, clearly want to up the pace and have not ruled out more boots on the ground.
In the absence of serious moves towards national reconciliation, one senior government figure also saw a campaign to retake Mosul as a vital way of forging national unity.
""Reconciliation is not moving ahead. The only way forward is to defeat IS in Mosul. Some Sunnis believe IS is their protector, as long as the government and the Hashd are as they are.
""The only way to win them over and have reconciliation and bring new leaders is to get IS out of Mosul.""","More than in any other country, Iraq's future is intimately bound up with the fate of self-styled Islamic State (IS)."
"Gamers develop their agents over time in the online game, so many feared they had lost weeks of progress.
The problem appears to have affected only people using the Xbox One version of the title.
The publisher, Ubisoft, said it would soon restore the missing data.
""The issue was caused by a malfunctioning server that couldn't synchronise character data correctly and corrupted them instead,"" Ubisoft told the BBC.
""The game client was unable to read this corrupted data, and simply assumed that the character didn't exist.
""Once this has been identified, we were able to restore the server to its normal functions, thus ensuring that the issue will no longer occur for other players.
""For those who experienced the issue, your character is not gone.
""We are currently working on a fix that should make it available shortly.
""Implementing this fix will require a server downtime, and we will let you know when we are ready to perform it.""
The Division sold more copies in its first day than any other Ubisoft title to date - including Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs.
It went on to spend four weeks at the number one spot in the GfK Entertainment All Formats video game charts, following its release on 8 March.
The story takes place in New York after the smallpox virus has been spread via infected banknotes.
The player assumes the role of a Division agent - a secretive organisation tasked with bringing order to the chaos that has engulfed Manhattan
""If you've spent 30 or 50 or 100 hours building up your progress, you're going to be quite upset when it magically disappears,"" said Keza MacDonald, editor of the games news site Kotaku UK.
""Similar things have happened before - for instance, when Grand Theft Auto Online was released, for the first several weeks, characters would just disappear.
""People are generally understanding of there being launch issues with online games and there can be an element of forgiveness, but the Division has been out for over a month now and people are going to have expected better.""
The Division had had a relatively smooth start, after experiencing some server issues in its early hours.
The 1.1 update was released on Tuesday to make the title ""more satisfying"".
Changes included ensuring players would be given a ""high-end"" reward when they killed a challenging computer-controlled enemy.
But it soon became apparent there was a problem.
""Wow, I really love this game, but this is too much - I lost my character,  and I'm not going to do a new one... bye The Division,"" tweeted Pedro Morales.
Another player, nicknamed Freak5how, wrote: ""If they do not get characters restored, I am going back to Destiny"" - a reference to Activision's rival online shooter.
One analyst said the fault highlighted the risks of a wider shift to making games dependent on remote computer servers.
""In the past, if you lost your character save and your console wasn't connected to the net, then you didn't really have anyone to blame,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, from the IHS consultancy.
""But in today's context, you've got your information being stored by a company, so it's out of your control.
""And when it affects lots of people it becomes a big problem for the firm involved.""
Ms MacDonald said a lot was now riding on Ubisoft resolving the issue as quickly as promised.
""If it takes a couple of days to sort out, you might forgive them,"" she said.
""But if it takes two weeks or longer to get the characters back - or they never return - you're probably not going to be inclined to play anymore.
""So, speed is really important when it comes to fixing problems like this.""",Ubisoft has promised to fix a fault with its blockbuster video game Tom Clancy's The Division that caused hundreds of players' characters to vanish.
"Alvaro Negredo ended a goal drought which stretched back to the opening day of the season when he put Boro ahead following a neat exchange of passes with Gaston Ramirez.
Riyad Mahrez equalised from the penalty spot after Calum Chambers was judged to have handled.
Negredo looked to have given Boro the points when he latched on to a long ball from Adam Forshaw and clinically dispatched a low shot past Foxes goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler.
But Slimani converted from the spot in the fourth minute of injury-time after Wes Morgan was fouled by Marten de Roon.
Relive Leicester v Middlesbrough as it happened
Saturday's Premier League reaction
There were murmurs of discontent from the home fans at the King Power Stadium, but Leicester's players rolled up their sleeves and fought right to the final whistle.
For large parts of the game, the Foxes lacked any kind of zip or purpose about their play. Crucially, though, they kept going and salvaged a valuable point.
It came on the back of Tuesday's 2-1 win over Club Brugge, which secured their passage to the knockout stages of the Champions League with a game to spare.
Importantly, it ensured Leicester did not slip to a third successive Premier League defeat.
""We showed fantastic character,"" said Foxes boss Claudio Ranieri. ""Lucky is someone who believes in something more.""

Negredo, who is on a season-long loan from Valencia, found the net for the first time since Boro's 1-1 draw against Stoke City on 13 August.
It was not just the powerful Spaniard's finishing that caught the eye at the King Power Stadium either.
Negredo held the ball up, linked up the play and was generally a handful for the Leicester defence.
He scored 23 goals in 48 appearances for Manchester City en route to helping them win the Premier League title in 2013-14. This display was reminiscent of those days.
Given his side's overall lack of goals this season, Boro boss Aitor Karanka will hope it represents the start of a hot streak for Negredo.
While Negredo was back among the goals, Jamie Vardy's struggles to find the net continue.
Vardy has not scored for the champions since 10 September - a run of 15 games. His form is in stark contrast to a year ago, when he scored for a record 11th Premier League game in a row.
Without Danny Drinkwater, suspended for three matches for elbowing Watford's Valon Behrami, Leicester tried too many high balls, which did not utilise Vardy's strengths.
But irrespective of that, Vardy's performance was subdued, as was his body language.
He could have few complaints when substituted with 25 minutes left.

Leicester manager Claudio Ranieri: ""We are fighting for a relegation battle. Now we could be tired but fortunately the character and spirit of the group is good. We knew it was a tough match. Twice fighting back is not easy.
""It was difficult to surprise Middlesbrough, who showed good football to score twice. It's a good performance in the end, I think the draw for us is very good.
""It was important not have to have three Premier League defeats.  I feel we have to fight until the end of season.""
Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka: ""We showed we are a good team and are playing well. We should have won the game and were better than them.
""It's unfair to draw this game. Our performances with and without the ball have been good. Against top teams, we have been really organised.
""I know how good Alvaro Negredo is, and knew the goals would arrive. He did that because the team worked hard. We all have to keep working now.""

"Along with technology investor Silver Lake, and with financial backing from Microsoft, he will offer to buy the firm for $24.4bn (£15.5bn).
The move will take Dell off the Nasdaq stock exchange after 25 years.
Mr Dell hopes to turn the tide for a firm that has struggled to compete with cheap Asian rivals and the boom in smartphones and tablet computers.
Dell's success over the last 29 years has made its founder one of the richest men in America.
The chief executive and chairman already owns about 14% of the firm. He and fellow senior executives will retain their existing stakes.
The buy-out of the remaining shares will be carried out by a consortium made up of Mr Dell himself, his own investment fund, and Silver Lake. It will be financed by loans from four banks, and by a $2bn loan from Microsoft.
Analysts said the move would give Mr Dell greater flexibility in turning the company around, by dispensing with the need to deliver strong results every quarter to shareholders on the stock market.
The entrepreneur said that the firm's long-term strategy would ""still take more time, investment and patience, and I believe our efforts will be better supported by partnering with Silver Lake in our shared vision"".
By Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent
For consumers looking for a decent PC at a keen price, Dell was for many years the obvious choice.
Design was never the company's strong suit - even when the firm moved on from beige boxes - but for many years it vied with HP for the number one spot in the PC market.
Now though, according to one view, we are moving into the post-PC era, and that has left Dell struggling to look relevant as smartphones and tablets grab all the consumer attention.
The most recent figures from Gartner showed a 5% year-on-year  fall in global PC shipments in the last quarter of 2012 - but Dell's shipments fell by 21%.
So far, Dell's attempts to move into the tablet world have flopped, and the stock market has been impatient for results.
Michael Dell will hope that, away from the relentless spotlight of quarterly reporting, he can get on with the long-term task of transforming his business.
But, given the seismic changes taking place in the way we use computers, he may still have to move fast to make Dell matter to tomorrow's consumers.
""One of the key questions is going to be how much influence Microsoft is going to have over Dell's strategy,"" said Cindy Shaw, analyst at Discern Group.
Microsoft provides the Windows operating systems for Dell's computers, as well as for rival PC makers such as Hewlett Packard.
Michael Dell founded the company - originally named ""PCs Limited"" - in 1984 at the age of 19, operating out of his dorm room at the University of Texas.
He later dropped out of university in order to develop his PCs, including innovative laptops, and to expand his business overseas.
But over the last decade, Dell has faced increasingly steep competition, from cheaper Asian PC manufacturers such as China's Lenovo, and from innovative rivals such as Apple and Samsung whose tablets and smartphones have superseded the desktop and laptop.
The company appeared to lose its direction between 2004-07, when Mr Dell stepped down from day-to-day management of the company, and has suffered a number of false starts since his return, including the unsuccessful launch of its ""Streak"" tablet computer in 2010.
Mr Dell first approached the board with a buy-out proposal in August, and news of the talks emerged in mid-January, propelling the company's share price higher.
Together with Silver Lake, he is offering shareholders $13.65 in cash per share.
Dell's share price jumped a relatively modest 14 cents to $13.41 on Tuesday on Wall Street - reflecting the fact that the news was already well anticipated by the market.
The company's board pointed out the offer represented a 25% premium over Dell's share price in mid-January when rumours of the deal first broke.
However, the share price still remains some way below the $17-$18 level it was trading at a year ago, and well below its all-time high of just under $60 in 2000.
Completion of the buy-out, which will require shareholder approval, is far from agreed.
Before completing the deal, Dell's board said it will conduct what it called a ""go shop"" period of 45 days during which it would actively seek competing offers to buy the firm at a better price.",Michael Dell has said he will buy back the world's number three PC-maker that he founded and that carries his name.
"But in recent years it, like many other seaside towns, has struggled.
The advent of cheap flights abroad and a recession meant the County Antrim town was forced to reinvent itself from its 1950s heyday.
And while the weather this year has been as unstable as the political landscape, neither seem to be putting tourists off spending money, with more visitors from the Republic of Ireland providing a welcome revenue stream.
Visitors to the north coast traditionally come from other parts of Northern Ireland, said Naldo Morelli, managing director of Morelli's Ice Cream.
""But this year, I suppose with Brexit and the pound weakening a little bit we've noticed more customers from the Republic of Ireland, so that helps too,"" he said.
""The Northern Ireland public are very used to having four seasons in one day, so thankfully for us they eat ice cream no matter the weather.""
Portrush's reinvention seems to be doing the trick for traders.
""Business is up 5% to 10% across the board, certainly the restaurants have been busy,"" said Ian Donaghey, the president of the Causeway Chamber of Commerce.
While the weather is not always kind, this is sometimes actually good for local businesses, added Mr Donaghey.
""If the weather is too good it keeps people on the beaches and they don't spend money in the town,"" he said.
""What some of the traders would tell you is that they like a sunny morning and a drizzly afternoon because it drives them into Barry's [amusement arcade] and the restaurants and bars.""
Portrush's much loved amusements and bucket-and-spade shops are still there, but now their neighbours are trendy coffee shops, restaurants and bars.
The town may not have completely shaken off its traditional image, but those who visit do not seem to mind.
Business owners hope a mixture of nostalgia and new attractions will keep people visiting the north coast for the rest of this summer season, and for many years to come.
It seems that come rain or shine, holidaymakers will always have a soft spot for Portrush.",The beauty of Northern Ireland's north coast made Portrush the go-to choice for family holidays for decades.
"The men are loyal to South Sudan's sacked Vice-President Riek Machar and crossed into the country with him in August following intense violence in the South Sudan's capital, Juba.
The 750 men have been disarmed and cared for by the UN mission.
But Congolese officials say they are now a security risk.
They are being housed in UN camps in the volatile east of DR Congo, near the city of Goma in North Kivu province.
The demand from DR Congo's government that the men be removed comes after a protest in Goma last Friday.
The South Sudanese fighters have not been in any reported trouble since their arrival.
But residents say they fear a repeat of the fallout of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda when perpetrators of the mass killings set up base in eastern DR Congo.
""In April 1994, the population of North Kivu lived up to their legendary hospitality by welcoming Rwandan refugees,"" Jean Paul Lumbu Lumbu, an activist in Goma, said.
""Unfortunately, the same refugees turned into those FDLR rebels and became executioners of North Kivu residents. That is why we deeply fear the gathering of South Sudanese rebels into camps.""
Correspondents say locals in Goma also fear the government of South Sudan, under President Salva Kiir, may exercise a ""right of pursuit"" across the border, exposing them to fresh conflict.
The UN has confirmed that it has been contacted about the issue but has not commented on whether it will acting on the request to remove them by 10 October.
Fighting between rival forces in Juba in July left hundreds of people dead less than a year after a peace deal was signed in South Sudan.

West Indies' policy has been to only select players if they feature in the same format in domestic cricket.
And many have chosen not to play in West Indian one-day competitions.
That is because they often clash with lucrative overseas leagues such as the Big Bash.
The West Indies will travel to England next month, beginning a three-match Test series with a day-night match at Edgbaston on 17 August.
The squad for that series will be missing a host of big names as it has already been selected.
Following the Test series, the teams will meet in a Twenty20 match at Chester-le-Street on 16 September before the first of five one-day internationals at Old Trafford on 19 September.
In a statement, Cricket West Indies (CWI) said the ""amnesty"" with the players' union was ""part of a wider strategy to be more inclusive and to improve player relations"".
In 2014, a tour of India ended abruptly because of a dispute over pay, while the West Indies missed out on qualifying for the Champions Trophy earlier this year.
""We recognise that it is highly unlikely that we will now automatically qualify for the 2019 World Cup,"" said CWI chief executive Johnny Grave.
""So whilst the qualifying tournament has yet to be confirmed by ICC, we may only have eight ODIs against England and New Zealand in the next six months to prepare.

"The letters threatened legal action, but the law firms were false. In some cases Wonga added fees for these letters to customers' accounts.
The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said 45,000 customers would be compensated.
Wonga has apologised and said the tactic ended nearly four years ago.
The City regulator has told the BBC it has sent a file to the police.
The company is the UK's largest payday lender, making nearly four million loans to one million customers in 2012, latest figures show.
An investigation found that Wonga sent letters to customers from fake law firms called ""Chainey, D'Amato & Shannon"" and ""Barker and Lowe Legal Recoveries"".
The plan was to make customers in arrears believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a law firm, with legal action threatened if the debt was not paid.
The company was using this tactic to maximise collections by piling the pressure on customers, the regulator said.
""Wonga's misconduct was very serious because it had the effect of exacerbating an already difficult situation for customers in arrears,"" said Clive Adamson, director of supervision at the FCA.
""The FCA expects firms to pay particular attention to fair treatment of those who have difficulty in meeting their loan repayments.""
The situation occurred between October 2008 and November 2010, and involved Wonga and other companies within its group.
As this happened before the FCA took over the regulation of payday lenders, it is unable to fine Wonga. It also said there would be no criminal investigation as it wanted to set up a compensation scheme as quickly as possible and a criminal probe would take time. Affected customers will receive about £50 each.
Instead, Wonga will start contacting customers in July to offer compensation, with money likely to be paid by the end of the month. This will either be paid in cash or customers will have their outstanding debt reduced.
""We would like to apologise unreservedly to anyone affected by the historical debt collection activity and for any distress caused as a result,"" said Tim Weller, interim chief executive of Wonga.
""The practice was unacceptable and we voluntarily ceased it nearly four years ago.""
Anyone who might have changed address in the intervening period should contact Wonga.
Labour MP and campaigner against payday loans Stella Creasy has questioned the lack of criminal investigation.
""Why in those instances where customers of Wonga charged debt collection fees for these letters is that not police matter?,"" she asked on social media site Twitter.
Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said: ""It is right the FCA is taking a tougher line on irresponsible lending and it does not get much more irresponsible than this.
""It is a shocking new low for the payday industry that is already dogged by bad practice and Wonga deserves to have the book thrown at it.""
The investigation was started by the FCA's predecessor, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). Wonga said it stopped the tactic voluntarily then offered information to the OFT.
In addition, in April this year, Wonga discovered that it had miscalculated some customers' balances.
This resulted in 200,000 people overpaying the company. Wonga said that the majority overpaid by less than £5, and a larger number underpaid.
Those who overpaid will be contacted by Wonga, and the underpaid debt will be cancelled.
Mr Weller said the company ""will learn from these mistakes"" and was strengthening its internal controls.
The problems for Wonga come shortly after its boss Niall Wass quit after six months in the job of chief executive. Mr Wass joined Wonga in January 2013 as chief operating officer - after the fake lawyer tactics ended - and became chief executive in November.
Earlier this month, chairman and founder Errol Damelin also announced that he was planning to quit.",Payday lender Wonga must pay £2.6m in compensation after sending letters from non-existent law firms to customers in arrears.

Two of the best saves you will see from Kasper Schmeichel, and reminiscent of his father Peter Schmeichel at his best. The save from Andy Carroll's header was immense and the shot stop from the same player was even better.
It could be argued that Schmeichel has been Leicester's most consistent player in what can only be described as a complicated season for the Foxes. However, what has been most impressive from the young keeper has been his honesty off the field around all the speculation involving Claudio Ranieri's departure. He fronted up for interviews and spoke with clarity and maturity about a very difficult situation, giving Leicester fans (and the public at large) some indication of what was happening behind the scenes.
It was not an easy situation for the goalkeeper but he stood up to the challenge. The Dane now faces a different test and that is having to maintain the sort of performance he showed against an unlucky West Ham to ensure his team remain in the Premier League. They can flirt with the Champions League all they want, but their Premier League status is what really matters. A point Ranieri apparently failed to understand.
Arguably against the tallest back four in the Premier League, Arsenal were in complete disarray when defending set-pieces and Craig Dawson took complete advantage. His two goals from almost identical set-pieces told the story. Arsenal did not, and could not, handle West Brom's aerial power.
If ever there was a time to bring on Per Mertesacker and plonk him in the heart of the Arsenal back four then this was it. So what was the point of having the German defender on the bench if you were not going to use him when necessary? Was Arsene Wenger waiting for Laurent Koscielny or Shkodran Mustafi to pull a white handkerchief from out of their shirt sleeve and wave it to the bench to signal that they couldn't cope? No, of course not, that's the manager's job to see the faults in his team and correct them as quickly as possible.
If you were ever going to bring on the big German, wasn't this the game? It was so obvious to me that no-one in the Arsenal back four fancied taking on West Brom's aerial threat. Which brings me to a much more worrying point for Wenger. It's one thing his team not having the heart for the battle, however it is something entirely different when your players don't have any heart left for the manager any more.
This display by Arsenal players was very telling and Wenger must seek a dignified exit from the Emirates as soon as possible otherwise his impressive record at the club will count for nought.
A couple of great blocks by John Stones were enough for me to realise this young man was on top of his game against the Reds. As the game unfolded, and the skiddy conditions became a nightmare for defenders, Stones seemed to become more assured. I must say his defensive partner Nicolas Otamendi often makes me nervous on occasions like these, but to be fair to the Argentine he handled Liverpool's counter-attack very well in the second half.
There is no doubt in my mind that Stones is growing into an excellent central defender, and the more I see him the more I detect that the juvenile risk-taking we saw in the early part of his career is being replaced with a calm maturity. It's good news for City and very good news for England.
Chelsea boss Antonio Conte was absolutely right when he said ""you can't go to Stoke and expect to win a game without a fight"". For someone who is in his first season of management in the Premier League, he's worked that out very quickly. Gary Cahill, on the other hand, will know all about the Potteries and what it takes to win at the Bet365 Stadium. The Chelsea captain gave a penalty away but redeemed himself and his team with a well-taken goal which puts the Blues in what I consider to be an unassailable position at the top of the table.
This time there was no Eden Hazard to bully, so Diego Costa was Stoke's target, and boy did they give it to him. If it wasn't Bruno Martins Indi dishing out the punishment then it was Ryan Shawcross who was putting Costa on notice that this was not the place that would suffer the Spaniard's antics.
However, it was Phil Bardsley who stood out amongst the would-be assassins having taken a piece out of Costa earlier in the contest before totally disgracing himself with the sort of lunge on Cesc Fabregas normally associated with WWE. It's perfectly obvious to everyone that Chelsea are the team to stop - any further advance toward the Premier League title and sides like Stoke are not going to be pleasant about it.
This full-back caught my attention during his days at Watford and even made my Team of the Week on a couple of occasions in the Quique Flores days. His run in the early part of the game down Arsenal's left-hand side would have resulted in a tap-in for Salomon Rondon had the centre-forward been more alert.
The Cameroon defender was equally adept in defence as he thwarted Theo Walcott's attempt to put Arsenal ahead having seen Ben Foster make a wonderful save from Aaron Ramsey.  As for Arsenal, it's all very well fans holding up banners in the stadium requesting their manager leave the club, meanwhile the team descends into farce.
Wenger might be struggling to do his job but Arsenal are in grave danger of losing that perennial Premier League fourth spot and an FA Cup semi-final if this form continues. There is no reason why the fans shouldn't do their job and support the team. So much depends on it.
What a way to score your first goal of the season. I was never one for chasing lost causes because logic seemed to suggest the cause was lost. However, Antonio Valencia chased a ball that looked utterly futile to everyone except Valencia. It seemed the threat of Valencia's speedy approach served to hurry Victor Valdes and in so doing caused the Boro goalkeeper to slip and offer the United player an empty net.
At that point there must have been thousands of coaches justifying themselves to youngsters all over the country on why chasing lost causes has always been worthwhile. But to see United boss Jose Mourinho disappear down the tunnel before the final whistle shaking both fists in total delight at the apparent three points was for me utterly shameful. What happens to head coach Steve Agnew in future, or Middlesbrough Football Club for that matter is, at this moment, in the balance but Agnew did deserve to receive a handshake from the Manchester United manager at the end of the game as tradition demands.
This is Manchester United Football Club and it has a long and proud history of doing things properly. I hope the United board have the courage to remind their employee who he represents. Sir Alex Ferguson, with all his tantrums, always respected the traditions of the game and would never have behaved in such a manner. As for Valencia, there can only be Zlatan Ibrahimovic stopping him from becoming United's fans' player of the season. I know who I would pick.
In the absence of Harry Kane, it was left to Christian Eriksen to pull the strings for Spurs against a very dangerous Southampton. His first-half performance was exceptional, epitomised by his well-taken goal. Tottenham are cruising at the moment. Second in the league and looking like finishing above Arsenal for the first time in 22 years.
I'm not entirely sure whether finishing in the top four or above Arsenal is a sign of real success, but I know Spurs fans will take both. Nevertheless, the mark of a top team has to be winning trophies and if they were to beat Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final and go on to win the trophy I would be duty bound to acknowledge this Spurs team has finally come of age.
However, as far as Tottenham are concerned, winning the FA Cup is only a stepping stone to winning the Premier League. That's the real prize.
This was a game I didn't want anyone to lose. It was a fabulous game of football and, for once, referee Michael Oliver didn't do anything daft. The managers were great with each other on the touchline, and both teams appeared totally committed to winning, with 22 players giving everything in very tricky conditions.
Kevin de Bruyne deserves a mention for that moment of magic and the ball of the game. It opened up Liverpool's defence so completely and left Sergio Aguero, the best natural finisher in the game, to do what he does best. Yet for me it was David Silva who provided City with all their inspiration. He had great support from Fernandinho, especially when the Brazilian joined him in midfield in the second half.
It was Silva who nearly provided City with all three points with a wonderful chipped ball for Raheem Sterling, but the England international simply wasn't equal to it. Credit to both managers, to the players and the referee. We saw a hell of a game.
There were so many good performances in this match I could have selected a number of Liverpool players. I thought Emre Can had one of his best games for Liverpool in months, Joel Matip showed composure under pressure and Georginio Wijnaldum looked like he was back to his best. However, as far as Liverpool were concerned I thought Sadio Mane was probably the pick of the bunch. It was Mane who looked the most threatening.
For the Liverpool penalty, it was James Milner who stepped up and converted the spot-kick, but I thought Raheem Sterling deserved a penalty when Milner clipped his heels in the box.
Granted, it would have taken a very brave referee to point to the spot, but there was no doubt in my mind. Liverpool look a side again now Mane is back and buzzing since his return from the African Cup of Nations. However, I still don't understand why Liverpool seem to struggle against the lesser teams.
This was a tricky game for Romelu Lukaku against Hull. The fact the player's refusal to sign a new contract was made public could have resulted in a negative reaction from Everton fans. Interestingly enough, no such reaction occurred, which must have been a relief and bolstered the player's confidence immensely. Lukaku's response was emphatic. An assist and two goals in the dying minutes by Lukaku killed off any thought of a Hull revival.
However, the sad truth is that any chance of Hull staging a fightback was destroyed much earlier with the utterly preposterous dismissal of Tom Huddlestone by referee Paul Tierney, which destroyed what would have been a perfectly good contest. There have been lots of good innovations since the introduction of the Premier League, but trying to turn the game into a 'non-contact' sport is not one of them. Fans want to see 11 versus 11 in all but extreme circumstances. A yellow card at best was all Huddlestone deserved for his tackle on Idrissa Gueye. The card would have put Huddlestone on notice that if repeated, he walked. A sending-off offence is like sending a man to the gallows - you can't afford to get it wrong. This sending-off offence was by no means conclusive.
As for Lukaku, I can think of a number of top teams at home and abroad who would pay considerably more for Lukaku than Everton spent bringing him to the club. Manchester United need to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic sooner rather than later. Chelsea have doubts about retaining Diego Costa because of the interests of China, Arsenal will need rebuilding post-Arsene Wenger - and Lukaku joining Sadio Mane at Liverpool is just too scary for words.
This was a lovely winner from a local lad with an enormous amount of talent. When Jesse Lingard scores goals they tend to be tremendous finishes and his strike against an outclassed Middlesbrough was an absolute belter. He and his partner in crime, Marcus Rashford, were superb against Boro. The problem for Rashford is that goals are proving to be rather elusive at the moment, while Lingard looks comfortable in front of the sticks.
These two young, local lads continue to prove United still have the capacity to develop talent.
What I also noticed during this very credible performance by United was they didn't miss the presence of Paul Pogba. The only interesting feature about United's record signing these days are his meticulous haircuts. If the Frenchman put as much effort into his game as he does in his hair there's no telling what he could achieve.","Chelsea maintained their 10-point lead at the top of the Premier League with a 2-1 win at Stoke, while Tottenham beat Southampton 2-1 at home to stay second."
"Coach Eddie Jones announced at the launch of the championship that the 30-year-old will continue in the role.
""I haven't actually told him... shall I say now? I'd like to announce Dylan's the captain,"" Jones said.
Hartley, who led England to the Grand Slam last year, was banned for hitting Leinster's Sean O'Brien in December.
He caught the Irish flanker high with a swinging arm during Northampton's 37-10 Champions Cup loss and was shown the third red card of his career.
The subsequent suspension took the total number of weeks he has been unavailable during his career to 60.
Hartley will not have played for nine weeks before England's opening game against France on 4 February at Twickenham.
When the captain was asked if he had changed his game in response to his latest sanction, Jones interrupted: ""He's had 60 weeks off mate, he's a world expert.""
The Australian added: ""I think he's ready. He trained well on Tuesday and has still got a couple of days to go. We're pleased to have him back. It's the continuity of the job.""
Hartley, when asked about his suitability for the role, said: ""We did this last year, talking about me. I'm confident, I feel fresh, I feel fit, and focused.
""I'm here on behalf of the team. The challenge is to use this week as best we can to get the preparation right for a huge first game.""
Hartley was dropped from England's 2015 Rugby World Cup squad after he headbutted Saracens' Jamie George, but was recalled by Jones after he replaced Stuart Lancaster.
The hooker went on to lead the side to a Six Nations Grand Slam as they embarked on a run of 14 consecutive Test match victories.
British and Irish Lions coach Warren Gatland has refused to be drawn on whether Hartley's disciplinary record will affect his chances of leading this summer's tour to New Zealand.

Jones attended the launch with a dressing on his face and a black eye, caused by a fall in the bathroom of his hotel.
However, the Australian did initially suggest he suffered the injury while attempting the combat sports England players have been practising since October.
""First we had judo and then we had MMA, so we're just going through all the martial arts sports to see what effect they have on the body,"" Jones said.
""My mother always told me I've got to shave and I forgot, so I walked out of the shower to get the shaver and this is what happened.""
Back row James Haskell has been given the all-clear to link up with the squad after recovering from a foot injury that kept him out for six months.
The 31-year-old was a key part of England's Grand Slam and unbeaten tour of Australia in 2016.
But, having missed the autumn internationals, he faces a battle to oust Tom Wood, who was this week singled out for praise by Jones.
Jones said people would ""have to wait and see"" if Haskell would feature against France in 11 days' time.
""He has not had much rugby,"" he added. ""He's played around 60 minutes against Zebre and 36 seconds against the opposition the previous week.""

"Trade talks after leaving the EU will need more UK officials with language skills, say the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Modern Languages.
There is already a languages skills shortage but currently the UK can rely on other EU nationals ""to plug the gap"", say the group.
Ministers say their reforms are already boosting language learning in schools.
Launching a checklist on Brexit and languages, the group say lack of language ability loses the UK an estimated 3.5% of economic performance.
The country currently relies on the EU to negotiate trade deals but this will no longer be possible once the UK has left the Union, they add.
APPG co-chair Baroness Coussins said: ""Brexit must make the UK's language skills a top policy issue.
""Language skills are vital for our exports, education, public services and diplomacy.""
Baroness Coussins called for ""a national plan to ensure the UK produces the linguists we need to become a world leader in global free trade and on the international stage.""
The group identify a need to boost skills in both European and non-European languages for the purposes of trade, international relations and security.
In particular, they fear the loss of European language skills if EU nationals already living in the UK are not guaranteed residency status post Brexit.
They also want the UK to continue full participation in the Erasmus+ scheme, where young people study, work volunteer and train abroad in Europe, some working as language assistants in schools.
The checklist includes calls to:
""It is essential that schools continue to be able to recruit EU nationals post-Brexit,"" said Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.
""There is already a critical shortage of language teachers and the last thing that we need is anything which makes this situation worse.
""We understand that Brexit means Brexit but it is vital that it does not also mean a full-blown crisis in language teaching.""
Mike Buchanan, head of Ashford School and chairman of the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference, said independent schools were proud of their ""increasingly central role in ensuring the survival of languages in British universities"".
""But more is needed to reverse this trend. The national situation is parlous,"" said Mr Buchanan.
Sara Davidson, head of modern languages at the private Oundle School and chairwoman of the Independent Schools Modern Languages Association, said she did not know of a language department that did not employ native speakers.
""Native speakers are helping us out amidst a major recruitment crisis in modern language teaching.
""We simply do not currently produce enough linguists in this country to fill the modern language teaching vacancies we have.""
Ruth Sinclair-Jones, UK director of Erasmus+, said the value of the scheme to the UK ""cannot be underestimated"".
""Losing UK participation would limit the future prospects of young people and the country as a whole,"" she said.
And Mark Herbert, head of schools programmes at the British Council, said: ""Learning a language isn't just a rewarding way to connect with another culture but boosts individual job prospects, as well as business and trade opportunities for the UK.""
A Department for Education spokeswoman said government policies meant the number of students taking one language at GCSE was up from 40% in 2010 to 49% this year.
The spokeswoman added: ""The UK's future access to the Erasmus+ programme will be part of wider discussions with the EU.
""Existing higher education UK students studying in the EU will continue to be subject to current arrangements.""","The government must plan now to avoid a post-Brexit languages crisis, say a cross-party group of MPs and peers."

"Cardiff council will discuss the plan for Waungron Road, Fairwater, which it said would cut bus travel times.
However, councillor Neil McEvoy said the plan was just about getting the Local Development Plan (LDP) approved.
Cabinet member Ramesh Patel said the council wanted an attractive viable public transport alternative.
A Liberal Deomcrat-led coalition spent £1m upgrading the site in 2008/09 but it was shut in 2014 by the current Labour council, which said it was not financially viable.
It said the interchange would be ""vitally important"" for a new public transport route across the city.
But Mr McEvoy claimed the council had kept its plans quiet.
""In politics whenever you don't want to do something you just say we can't afford it,"" said Mr McEvoy.
""But this is not a question of finance. This is just about getting the LDP approved.""
In a statement, Mr Patel said the interchange would cut journey times by allowing people to travel between east and west Cardiff by bus without driving into the city centre.
The site is also next to Waungron Road railway station, which he said would allow more commuters to use both buses and trains.
The LDP is being examined by the Welsh government's planning inspector.

"Scientists in Australia said urban areas were expanding rapidly in a complex ""non-linear"" way that existing models failed to capture effectively.
Assessments needed to be modified if ecologists were to get an accurate picture of the environment, they added.
The findings appear in the Trends in Ecology and Evolution journal.
""Our paper aims to raise the awareness that the ingrained perception in ecology that urbanisation intensity and age - and associated environmental changes - vary in a [uniform manner] from the core to the city fringes, does not apply easily to contemporary patterns of urbanisation,"" said co-author Cristina Ramalho, a researcher from the University of Western Australia's School of Plant Biology.
""It is necessary, therefore, that ecologists adjust the way they think and conduct research to the reality of contemporary cities.""
She explained that, historically, cities grew slowly in a relatively compact manner, through progressive rings of urban development.
However, Ms Ramalho added, contemporary patterns of expansion were ""markedly different"".
""Cities are growing very rapidly, they are increasingly expansive and dispersed, sprawling in... spider-like configurations across large distances, and embedding fragments of other land uses in the rapidly changing landscape,"" she said.
Ecologically, this type of expansion was having ""dramatic impacts"".
""It is driving the large-scale loss and fragmentation of natural and semi-natural habitats in several countries and cities worldwide,"" she told BBC News.
""In countries such as the US and Australia, urbanisation is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss.""
The researchers said current models used by ecologists to assess urbanisation looked at this issue in a ""rather simplified"" way - such as using broad categories, including urban, suburban and rural.
Ms Ramalho explained why this needed to be updated: ""If contemporary cities expand in a complex, non-linear manner, then the assumption that urbanisation intensity and age can be assessed based on a site's position along a linear urban-to-rural gradient can be misleading.""
She added that the measures also failed to adequately capture the effects of important drivers, such as landscape fragmentation and disturbances. She also said that the changing nature of urbanising landscapes were not reflected in systems that did not have a temporal dimension.
The researchers suggested, as an alternative, that the impacts of an urbanising landscape should be assessed by looking at the changing attributes of a particular area, or the characteristics of a neighbouring landscape.
""Ecologists should move beyond the use of aggregated urbanisation measures and consider a comprehensive set of driving factors selected based on the characteristics of the study area and ecological question of interest,"" Ms Ramalho said.
""Ecologists should also consider the temporal dynamics of landscape change, and the effects of land-use history and time lags on biodiversity responses to on-going environmental change.""
By adopting such an approach would provide information that would help policymakers and planners, she added.
""A temporal perspective considering the fragmentation and land-use history can provide insight into the remnants environmental conditions and conservation value and, therefore, be used in prioritising conservation.
""Priorities could be, for instance, those remnants without significant land-use legacies and those that were recently fragmented.""","The way researchers assess urban ecology needs to change in order to take into account the way modern cities are developing, a study suggests."

There are conflicting reports as to who was responsible for the killing of the militants.
Unnamed officials were quoted by AFP news agency as saying security forces opened fire on the men as they were about to carry out an attack on a gas pipeline in central Sinai.
A different account came from officials who told the Associated Press that Shadi el-Menei and at least three associates were killed by 15 attackers in revenge for the killings of tribesmen by Ansar Beit al-Maqdis.
Islamist groups in the Sinai have stepped up their attacks against Egypt's army and police forces in the past year.

Devon and Cornwall Police, a Coastguard helicopter and search and rescue helicopter have assisted with the operation, as well as Teignmouth RNLI lifeboat, Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service and Dartmoor Search and Rescue Team.
Torbay Hospital on-call Director Martin Ringrose said: ""We are aware that one of our junior doctors is missing.
""Our thoughts are with her family and loved ones at this very distressing time.
""We will do whatever we can to support the authorities investigating her disappearance and searching for her, as well as providing support to her colleagues, who are anxious for her wellbeing.""
A police spokesperson said: ""We are searching for a missing person and we are extremely concerned for her welfare. The conditions have been rough since she was reported missing.
""We are working with the Coastguard and other agencies.""
A statement released by UK Coastguard said they had been called to support the police operation at 6.20pm on February 12.
Torbay, Teignmouth and and Berry Head Coastguards have been involved in the search.

"About 1,250 people died in road accidents last year, the ministry said.
The decision has been strongly criticised by many Cameroonians, who say it will affect their businesses and nightlife.
The ban means that buses and taxis must be off roads from 2000 GMT to 0400 GMT.
The ministry said night travel accounted for 35% of accidents, even though few people commuted at night.
The accidents were caused mainly by heavy drinking, it said.
About 12,000 people died last year in road accidents in Cameroon and another 12,000 were wounded, the ministry said.
The BBC's Randy Joe Sa'ah in the capital, Yaounde, says that while many people welcome moves to reduce fatalities, they believe poor roads are the main cause of accidents.
Only about 20% of Cameroon's roads are tarred, he says.
Many people are not sure how they will travel to and from work because some journeys last more than six hours, our reporter says.
Police have been ordered to pull off buses and taxis that travel after 2000 GMT, raising the prospect of commuters sleeping on the roadside or walking home, he says.
The ban has also been condemned by owners of bars and night clubs, who believe that it will ruin their businesses and destroy nightlife in big cities.
Small-scale traders said their income would be badly affected because their produce would not reach markets early in the morning.
""I'm finished. This is bad for me and my children,"" a vegetable hawker, Grace Teboh, was quoted by the AFP news agency as saying.","Cameroon has banned all night-time public transport on roads to curb accidents caused by heavy drinking, the transport ministry says."
"Burton's Foods, which owns and bakes brands such as Jammie Dodgers and Wagon Wheels, said it was closing its site in Moreton after a business review.
The company said it would invest Â£7m at its manufacturing sites in Edinburgh and Llantarnam, South Wales.
It also plans to consolidate its Knowlsey multi-site distribution operations in a single location.
Burton's Foods intends to phase down production from March before completing the closure later in 2011.
Chief executive Ben Clarke said: ""Today's announcements recognise the need to transform our supply chain.
""The proposed job losses are deeply regrettable, but, along with the new Â£25m investment we are making in our UK manufacturing capability, will help deliver sustainable profitable growth for the company in a highly competitive and challenging market.""
Angela Eagle, Labour MP for Wallasey, said it was a ""huge blow to the community"".
""This is the largest private sector employer in the constituency and they have decided to close this plant at a time when the job market is deeply depressed, leaving 342 families struggling after Christmas.
""I will pledge to work during the consultation to persuade them to change this decision.""
She added: ""Over the years we have given endless support to the plant, injecting public money to keep it going and secure those jobs, and it is a devastating blow that they turn around today and do this to Morton.""
Wirral Council leader Councillor Jeff Green said: ""I am incredibly disappointed by this proposal and will be seeking an urgent meeting with Burton's to examine and discuss the reason behind their decision.
""I also wish to investigate whatever opportunities there are to continue to work with the company to secure jobs in Wirral and the future of the site.""
The Unite union's national officer Jennie Formby said: ""Burton's has been part of the Wirral for generations, providing stable employment for families across the community.
""So we will fight with all our power to save this plant because closure is not an option. It will devastate this community.""
Edinburgh MSP David McLetchie has welcomed the announcement of further investment at Burton's Sighthill factory, which has more than 600 permanent and 250 agency staff.
Mr McLetchie said: ""This is great news for the Sighthill workers as well as a huge relief, because when Burton's announced this review of its facilities across the UK back in October there was a distinct possibility that Sighthill could be closed or seriously run down.""
Burton's Foods, which makes branded and own-label biscuits and snacks, is the second largest biscuit supplier in the UK.
As well as Wagon Wheels and Jammie Dodgers, it also makes Cadbury's chocolate biscuits including the Crunchie, Turkish Delight and Caramel biscuit ranges.","A biscuit manufacturer is to close its Wirral factory, with the loss of 342 jobs."
"About 1,000 people attended a rave at Twyford Wood near Bourne in Lincolnshire on 23 May.
Police carried out an operation to close it down, which led to 21 officers and a dog being injured.
Chelsea Harvey, 21, from Norfolk, admitted dangerous driving and was jailed for 12 months.
Harvey, of Ashley Walk, Dereham, drove her Peugeot 206 about 350 metres (1,148ft) at speeds of up to 30mph (77km/h) with PC Rob Bentley on the bonnet, Lincoln Crown Court heard.
At one point she was involved in a collision with a camper van, but continued with the officer still clinging on.
PC Bentley suffered ""relatively minor physical injuries"" but the court heard the psychological damage had had a lasting impact.
James Bide-Thomas, prosecuting, said Harvey, who had two female friends in her car, had been told to stop by PC Bentley, but instead had ""jerked forward violently"" knocking the officer off his feet and leaving him ""spread-eagled"" on the bonnet.
Judge Michael Heath, passing sentence on Wednesday, told her: ""If you drive as you did with a police officer on your bonnet for the distance that you did, and at the speed you did, there can only be one sentence that I can impose upon you. That is immediate custody.""
Jonathan Straw, defending, said Harvey works in a centre for deaf-blind people run by the charity Sense.
He described her as acting in ""blind panic"" and added: ""She is very sorry for what happened. She didn't intend to hurt anyone. She went out with two friends that day simply to enjoy a party.""
Harvey was also disqualified from driving for a year.","A woman drove at a police officer manning a road block and carried on for 350 metres with him ""spread-eagled"" on her bonnet, a court heard."
"The deal will take legal force when it is ratified by 55 signatories producing 55% of global emissions.
Ratification by China and the US bumps the total to 40% of emissions. It will just need the EU and a couple of other major polluters to cross the threshold.
Other nations will still tussle over their own ratification, but this sets clear ambition, and the US-China deal will put pressure on G20 nations over the weekend to move faster with their pledge to phase out subsidies to fossil fuels.
President Obama is in China at the end of a legacy tour, in which he has visited Nevada and Hawaii to warn of climate disruption.
Over recent years he has persuaded the reluctant Chinese that they need to accept their own climate commitments in order to buy him political space for Americaâ€™s pledges.
Both nations have set widely differing targets reflecting their different stages of economic development.
The USA says it intends to reduce emissions by 26-28% below its 2005 level in 2025, trying hard for the upper limit.
China has promised to stop the upward path of its emissions by 2030, although it will far exceed that goal.
But even if enough other players step forward to make the Paris deal law, huge challenges lie ahead.
The current pledged emissions cuts are still projected to bring 2.7C or more of warming â€“ well above the aspirational 1.5C heating that the UN accepts should really be the limit.
And that is supposing that nations keep their promises on emissions cuts.
In the UK the Labour Party has urged Theresa May to ratify the Paris deal immediately.
The US-China deal will also put pressure on G20 nations over the weekend to move faster with their pledge to phase out subsidies to fossil fuels.

"From this autumn, the leading UK independent school is going to provide classes in leadership to Chinese students, using live online tuition.
The school has formed a partnership with a technology firm to create a company called EtonX.
The school, in Berkshire, says any income raised by the international project will be used for bursaries to cover pupils' fees.
Percy Harrison, director of information technology at Eton College, says the school would be able to reach a wider number of pupils, without setting up an overseas campus.
He said there were risks to the ""brand"" of independent schools setting up overseas ""franchises"", but the online venture would allow Eton to provide lessons for students in China without losing control of the quality.
The EtonX project will see pupils in China learning from a mixture of interactive content produced at Eton, with one-to-one online teaching from tutors in the UK.
The cost, about Â£700 per pupil, will be paid by Chinese parents as an optional extra, like a music lesson.
Teachers from Eton have been to the schools in China to talk to their counterparts in Chinese classrooms. At the launch, the project is expected to involve ""less than a dozen"" schools in China.
The lessons, aimed at China's aspirational middle-class families, will teach secondary pupils a ""modern leadership programme"", taught in English and focusing on communication skills and how to work collaboratively.
The aim is to give Chinese students skills for a modern international workplace, which will help them think beyond a school system with a high level of rote learning.
Mr Harrison said the project would carry Eton's ""DNA"" in terms of the school's emphasis on developing leadership.
The project is being run with education-technology company Eighteen70 . Its founder, Simon Walsh, said he wanted to ""humanise"" digital education through individual online tuition.
Such online courses have been mainly associated with universities - and the EtonX brand is reminiscent of online projects by US universities, such as HarvardX and MITx.
Former pupils at the school include Prince William and Prime Minister David Cameron.",Eton College is going to launch online lessons for schools in China.
"The Oromo and the Amhara make up about 60% of the population. They complain power is held by a tiny Tigrean elite.
Violence has intensified since last Sunday when at least 55 people were killed in clashes between police and protesters at an Oromo festival.
Hundreds have died in months of protests, human rights groups say.
Tens of thousands have also been detained, they say.
Declaring the state of emergency, Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn said in a televised address: ""We put our citizens' safety first. Besides, we want to put an end to the damage that is being carried out against infrastructure projects, education institutions, health centres, administration and justice buildings.""
The state of emergency will last for six months.
BBC World Service Africa editor Mary Harper says the violent protests are the most serious threat to Ethiopian stability in a quarter of a century.
Source: CIA World Factbook estimates from 2007
The protesters have been attacking foreign companies, she says, threatening Ethiopia's reputation as a growing economy, ripe for international investment.
The details of the state of emergency remain unclear, but she adds that protesters have already shown they will not back down when faced with force.
Many roads into and out of the capital, Addis Ababa, are blocked by protesters.
The protests since last November are for manifold reason, and include:
In the most recent unrest in Oromia, at least 55 people were killed in a stampede.
Opposition activists blame the police for causing panic at the annual Ireecha celebrations - a traditional Oromo religious festival. The government blames ""anti-peace forces"" demonstrating in the crowd.
Police fired tear gas to disperse protesters angered at their handling of the event, witnesses told the BBC.
Protesters say violence by the security forces led to the stampede, but the PM denied security forces had opened fire.
Correspondents say that while the ruling coalition has some solid achievements to show for its 25 years in power, it has been unable to manage the transition from being a secretive revolutionary movement to running an open, democratic government.",Ethiopia has declared a state of emergency following months of anti-government protests by members of the country's two largest ethnic groups.
"Writing in the journal Science, they said this could lead to a gap of 10 years before the next epidemic.
The Imperial College London team created a model using data from the current outbreak in Latin America.
But a Zika expert said predicting anything with any degree of certainty was impossible.
The scientists, from the Medical Research Council Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling at Imperial, calculated that the epidemic, which began in Brazil in 2015, would burn itself out within three years.
Because the virus is unable to infect the same person twice, as more and more people become infected, reaching a level called ""herd immunity"", infection levels fall and the epidemic dies out.
Until there was a new generation who had not been exposed to Zika virus, there would be a long period with few new cases, the researchers said.
They said this mirrored the pattern of other epidemics, such as chikungunia - a virus similar to Zika.
Earlier this year, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a global public health emergency because of the risk to newborn children.
Although Zika infection is largely mild, with most people having no symptoms, it is known to cause microcephaly - babies born with undersized heads.
In severe cases, children can die and babies who survive can face intellectual disability and developmental delays.
The Olympic Games are going ahead in Rio, Brazil, in August, despite recent concerns from leading scientists that holding the event is ""unethical"".
The research paper said the current outbreak was not ""containable"" and targeting the Aedes aegypti mosquito carrying the virus would have limited impact.
Prof Neil Ferguson, lead author of the research, said that any efforts to slow the spread of the virus could actually prolong the current epidemic.
""Slowing transmission between people means the population will take longer to reach the level of herd immunity needed for transmission to stop.
""It might also mean that the window between epidemics could actually get shorter.""
However, Prof Ferguson said there were still many unanswered questions about Zika which could affect predictions.
The virus could become endemic in Latin America which would result in smaller, frequent outbreaks, for example, and he said no-one yet understood why Latin America was particularly affected.
""One possibility is climate may have in some way aided spread of the virus, as spread coincided with an El Nino event,"" he said.
""Genetic mutation of the virus might also have played a role, although early data currently give limited support for this hypothesis.""
He added that previous exposure to Dengue fever might heighten the Zika infection in a person, as recent studies had suggested.
But Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said although the paper was interesting, there were still a lot of gaps in the data.
""In truth, there are so many really important scientific unknowns surrounding Zika that it is impossible to predict what will happen with any degree of certainty.
""Key questions that remain unanswered include how many people have been infected, the duration that people are immune to the virus once they have been infected, whether or not past exposure to related viruses like Dengue affects Zika susceptibility and if wildlife reservoirs of virus now exist.""
He added: ""These will only be answered with improved diagnostic tests and further research in the laboratory and out in the field.""","The current Zika epidemic is likely to end within three years because there will be too few people left to infect, a team of scientists is predicting."

""I'm on the plank now so walk right behind me,"" a guide said as we squelched across a muddy swamp trying not to sink in too deep.
After walking for about an hour and a half from the village of Kalaba in Bayelsa state, I caught the first glimpse of an expansive tranquil lake through the trees.
On the shore are shelters made of wooden poles draped in material.
Every two years several families set up a camp at Lake Masi where they fish for just three months.
""After preparing the nylon and woven basket nets we go into the lake and drive the fish into one area,"" Woloko Inebisa told me.
""By fishing every two years we allow the fish to grow large. If we fished every year there would only be very small fish here,"" the 78 year old told me as two men in dug out canoes adjusted the nets inside a section of the lake that had been fenced off with cane reeds.
Smoke drifted across the camp as women dried the fish over home made grills above smouldering fires.
""I will use this money to pay my children's school fees, to buy books for them, to buy their school uniforms and to do everything for them,"" said mother-of-three Ovie Joe.
When these families return to their villages they will continue to grow crops but will have raised some capital from the fishing season.
""We have water for drinking and plenty of fish. But I'm not just here to feed my stomach - I'll save up money for when I go back to the village,"" Mr Inebisa said.
Just a few kilometres away near Taylor Creek is a very different picture.
An oil spill from June 2012 has left the ground covered in a dark sludge and the trees are all blackened by fire.
Environmentalists believe local contractors often pay youths to set fire to the area where the spill has occurred.
This can reduce the spread of the oil but has other detrimental effects on the environment.
Despite extensive flooding late last year the oil has not dispersed and there are still signs of the rainbow sheen on the surface.
Your ears also tell you all is not well - there is hardly any birdsong as the pollution has sucked the life out of the area.
""When I walked here the crude oil was spilling out so fast I couldn't even get near the spill point itself,"" said Samuel Oburo, a youth leader from Kalaba.
Running through this area is an underground pipeline belonging to Nigeria AGIP Oil Company - which is partly owned by the Italian oil giant, Eni.
It says numerous leaks near Taylor Creek were all caused by people breaking into the pipe - sabotage.
On 23 March Eni issued a statement announcing the closure of all its activities in the area because the theft of oil, known as bunkering, was so rife.
""The decision was made due to the intensified bunkering, consisting in the sabotage of pipelines and the theft of crude oil, which has recently reached unsustainable levels regarding both personal safety and damage to the environment,"" the statement read.
People in the village suggest corroded pipes as a possible trigger of the spill and they doubt it was caused by sabotage.
The breaking of pipes and theft of the oil is so rampant in the Niger Delta that experts believe several interest groups are involved.
""There is a high level conspiracy between the security forces, the community and oil workers to steal the oil,"" says environmental campaigner Erabanabari Kobah.
""That is why people are not prosecuted and convicted even though the crime is happening at an alarming rate,"" he says.
There is very little transparency when it comes to the awarding of contracts to clean up any oil spills.
This has led to increased incidents of sabotage as some believe the more oil spills there are the more money there is to share around.
The pollution is having a terrible impact on the environment.
""There is oil here. We are suffering,"" said Jeti Matikmo, carrying a pole on his shoulder on which bundles of fish were tied.
""Many of our crops are not growing well because of the oil spill and we are not killing fish in the ponds anymore.
""So we have to trek for more than two hours to where it is clean and where there is no oil.""
Back at Lake Masi a crowd gathered as two men waded ashore dragging an enormous woven basket behind them. It was heavy with fish.
""There's nothing like pollution here. Although if the oil prospecting companies come they may find oil and all that could change,"" said Mr Inebisa.
""If this pond is polluted, hunger is the answer,"" he said adding that in his entire life he had not gained a single coin from the oil of the Niger Delta.",A pristine paradise - these are not words you often hear to describe the Niger Delta in southern Nigeria.

Mae cais dan y Ddeddf Rhyddid Gwybodaeth wedi dangos bod y cyngor wedi talu £29,414.08 tuag at ffioedd cyfreithiol Mr James yn yr achos.
Dywedodd Swyddfa Archwilio Cymru nad oedd addewid yr awdurdod i dalu'r bil yn gyfreithlon.
Yn 2012, dywedodd Mr James y byddai unrhyw arian y byddai'n derbyn fel iawndal ""yn cael ei dalu i'r awdurdod"".
Cafodd Mrs Thompson orchymyn i dalu iawndal o £25,000 i Mr James, ond yn flaenorol mae ei gyfreithwyr wedi gwrthod cadarnhau y bydd yr arian yna'n cael ei ad-dalu.
Nid yw Mr James wedi gwneud unrhyw daliadau, ond dywedodd yr awdurdod: ""Hyd y gwyddom, nid yw Mr James wedi derbyn unrhyw iawndal gan Mrs Thompson.""
Ond mae Mrs Thompson yn dweud ei bod wedi gwneud dau daliad o £250 i Mr James, a'i bod yn credu y dylai ad-dalu'r bil cyfreithiol.

"The airport said its £16bn plan for expansion included addressing flooding from Thames tributaries that burst their banks early in 2014.
The Environment Agency, which has plans to meet Heathrow bosses in the next week, said it was ""very encouraged"".
""I believe this scheme will happen,"" said spokesman David Murphy.
In February last year, flooding affected homes and businesses along the river in Berkshire, Surrey and the London boroughs of Kingston and Richmond.
The River Thames defence scheme involves reducing the flood risk between Datchet and Teddington by building a flood channel and improving three weirs.
The government announced in its autumn statement it would contribute £220m towards the scheme, with businesses and utility companies being asked to chip in.
Leader of Surrey County Council David Hodge has said Heathrow would be one of those asked to contribute.
Heathrow said its expansion plan included a ""once-in-a-generation"" opportunity to address issues like flooding from nearby rivers, particularly the Colne and Wraysbury.
""We will work and support the Environment Agency and local authorities in developing better flood alleviation schemes to protect homes and property located away from the airport.""
The Airports Commission is currently considering three options for expanding airport provision in south-east England.
It is due to make its final recommendation to the government in the summer.
Mr Murphy, Environment Agency executive for the River Thames scheme, said: ""One of the key factors of expansion at Heathrow will be to manage water associated with that development.
""This whole area has many rivers many lakes and therefore water management is incredibly important because of the potential for flooding which we saw last year.""",Heathrow airport could be among businesses contributing to a £300m River Thames defence scheme if it gets the go-ahead to expand.
"David Capstick was walking in the mid Wales national park Saturday when he met the soldiers in a distressed state.
Relatives of L/Cpl Craig Roberts, 24, from Penrhyn Bay, Conwy, paid tribute saying he had died ""in the pursuit of his dream"".
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond announced a full inquiry.
We, Craig's family, would like to thank all our and Craig's friends for their kind thoughts and support.
We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives.
We wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of his dream.
Next month Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the secretary of state for education and we were all very proud of him.
We would like to thank the Ministry of Defence family liaison officer for all his help and support in these trying times.
Speaking to Channel 4 news, Mr Capstick described how he was walking in the Beacons when he was passed by a line of soldiers moving in the opposite direction at five or 10-minute intervals.
""We then came across two soldiers who had clearly broken that intended mode of operation and were proceeding slowly together, and one of the soldiers made a compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague,"" he said.
""He was upset,"" he added. ""The other soldier was trying to make the best of the situation and asked if we could spare any water for his colleague, not for himself.""
Mr Capstick added that it ""certainly was slightly odd"" that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were ""clearly in distress.""
In a statement issued through the Ministry of Defence, Mr Roberts's father Kelvin said: ""We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives.""
He said he had died ""in the pursuit of his dream"".
Mr Roberts, who had worked as a teaching assistant in London, was due to take up a job in Whitehall in the office of Education Secretary Michael Gove.
He had served with the Territorial Army (TA) for more than five years and was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment.
It is believed he served as a reservist in Iraq and Afghanistan, and had taken part in several exercises including a training mission in Texas with the American National Guard.
He had taken part in a four-week trial for the TA SAS reservists ending in a 40-mile (64km) hike over the Brecon Beacons.
L/Cpl Roberts was described as being ""the salt of the earth"" by one friend, who added that the soldier was ""extremely dedicated"".
The University of Leicester economics graduate was described by Professor Ali al-Nowaihi as a ""very promising young man - independent, strong willed and determined"".
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner said he understood the deaths occurred after the SAS training and preparation phase, right at the start of the selection phase.
He also understood there were extra water supplies available in the area, in addition to the water the men were carrying.
SAS selection course
The Brecon Beacons is home to the Infantry Battle School and makes up one of Britain's largest military training areas.
According to the MoD website, the SAS (Reserve) selection course is run twice a year and consists of two main components - ""aptitude"" and ""continuation"".
The ""progressively arduous"" aptitude phase is designed to select volunteers with the right qualities, including physical and mental robustness; self-confidence; self-discipline; the ability to work alone; and the ability to assimilate information and new skills.
The continuation training - after passing aptitude - is an intensive period of instruction and assessment on Special Forces tactics, techniques and procedures, including weapons and standard operating procedures.",A walker said he encountered soldiers making a plea for water on the day two reservists died during SAS selection training in the Brecon Beacons.
"The award is considered the top prize in the field. It is sometimes called the Little Nobel Prize for Literature.
The jury said Cao was a unanimous choice for the writing prize, because he ""writes beautifully about the complex lives of children facing great challenges"".
The Peking University professor of Chinese and children's literature is well known in literary circles in China, and has won several prizes at home.
He is known particularly for his books set in 1950s and 1960s rural China, drawing from his childhood experiences.
Cao, 62, grew up in backbreaking poverty in Jiangsu province, the son of a principal for rural primary schools.
In one of his books recounting his childhood, he recalled he often had nothing much to eat and would look forward to having a meal of rice gruel once every 15 days.
""My home village was well known for its poverty. Day in and day out, my family lived with deprivation,"" he wrote.
""I would gather grass from the riverbanks. Mother would diligently stir fry it in a oil-less steel wok, saying she was making me a dish of stir-fried leeks to eat.""
The International Board on Books for Young People (IBBY), which gives out the Hans Christian Andersen Award, noted that ""his childhood, though materially poor, was emotionally and aesthetically rich"", attributes it said were evident in his writing.
One of Cao's best-known children's books outside China is his 2005 work Bronze and Sunflower, set during the Cultural Revolution.
It tells the tale of a young city girl, Sunflower, who accompanies her artist father when he is forcibly sent to the countryside to labour among peasants, as millions of Chinese were in the 1960s and 70s.
She befriends a peasant boy, Bronze, who persuades his family to take Sunflower in after her father dies and looks out for her, while she teaches him to read and write.
Critics praised it for its meaningful story and Cao's lyrical prose.
""Bronze was hungry to learn and gobbled up every character Sunflower knew, writing them out on the ground and in his notebook. The two of them never stopped. Wherever they went, whatever they saw, Bronze wanted to know what the characters were...
Bronze saw the beautiful world around him transform into the magical world of characters. The sun became more gorgeous, more vivid, more enticing than ever. Likewise, the moon, the sky, the earth, the wind, the rain... everything took on a new life.
And Bronze, who was used to careering around the fields whatever the weather, was changing too. He was calmer than he used to be.""
Translated from original Chinese text by Helen Wang
Another book published in 1997, Straw House, traces the coming of age story of a young village boy, Sang Sang, throughout his six years in primary school.
Cao told China's Xinhua news agency in 2007 that the book was based on his experiences as his family followed his father, who was often transferred from school to school across the province.
It won several prizes in China including the country's top National Children's Literature Award. ""His fluid, poetic prose depicts honest, sometimes raw and often melancholy moments of life,"" said IBBY.
Chinese netizens welcomed the news of his win, with many agreeing it was well deserved.
Several said on microblogging network Sina Weibo that they had fond memories reading his books in school.
""The simple memories of childhood,"" commented one Weibo user, while another said: ""His works were what our generation grew up reading, they were the books that accompanied us as we grew up.""",Beijing-based author Cao Wenxuan has become the first Chinese author to win the Hans Christian Andersen award for children's literature.
"The bill does not ban pornography in the mainly Mormon state.
However, it calls for greater ""efforts to prevent pornography exposure and addiction"".
One group representing the adult entertainment industry attacked what it called ""an old-fashioned morals bill"".
Pornography, the bill says, ""perpetuates a sexually toxic environment"" and ""is contributing to the hypersexualisation of teens, and even prepubescent children, in our society"".
Further steps must be taken to change ""education, prevention, research, and policy change at the community and societal level"" against what it calls an epidemic, but it does not suggest how changes should be implemented.
The bill was signed by Republican Governor Gary Herbert, who said the volume of pornography in society was ""staggering"".
One 2009 study by Harvard Business School said that Utah was the state with the highest percentage of online porn subscribers in the US.
Some studies have, however, indicated that porn may not be addictive.
The bill was supported by the anti-porn campaign group Fight the New Drug. Reports have pointed out the group's founders are all members of the conservative Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or the Mormon Church.
Close to 63% of the state's residents are Mormon, but Fight the New Drug's leaders have denied working on behalf of the Mormon Church.
The Free Speech Coalition, a porn industry association, called for more dialogue.
""We should live in a society where sexuality is spoken about openly, and discussed in nuanced and educated ways, and not stigmatised,"" said Mike Stabile, a spokesman for the group.
""We all should work together to prevent non-adults from accessing adult material.""","The US state of Utah has become the first to declare pornography a public health risk in a move its governor says is to ""protect our families and our young people""."
"About 50 people have now been re-settled in Torfaen, Ceredigion, Neath Port Talbot and Caerphilly.
More will be dispersed to other areas in the new year.
David Cameron has confirmed the first 1,000 Syrian refugees are now in the UK under a resettlement scheme.
The UK government has promised to accept 20,000 Syrians over five years, with about 1,000 coming to Wales.
Eleven refugees arrived in Aberystwyth last week after being picked up from the airport by the British Red Cross.
Ceredigion council's families first co-ordinator Catherine Morgan said they were being helped to settle into their new lives.
""They're happy, they're relieved to be here. They're smiling,"" she said.
""They're just settling in at the moment, they've been through a lot to get here. It's very early days but hopefully they'll settle in well and enjoy living in Ceredigion.
""There were lots of smiles and I did apologise for the rain when they arrived because it was raining very hard and they said 'it's lovely' and 'thank you'. They're happy to be here.""
All those being helped have fled violent conflict in Syria and several are victims of torture.
They were all in refugee camps in neighbouring countries in the Middle East where the UN High Commissioner for Refugees identified them as being vulnerable.
The UK government is giving all refugees who are being brought here under the Syrian Vulnerable Person Resettlement (VPR) programme five years' humanitarian protection status.
This means they have the right to remain in Wales for five years with permission to work and access public funds.
Many are families with young children.
Alun Williams, head of policy support at Ceredigion council, said: ""The Home Office has vetted them for extremist views and criminality. Only if they are successfully vetted do they get to be part of the scheme. They wouldn't be allowed into this country if they didn't pass those tests.
""They are ordinary people who have been in very difficult circumstances and who have seen and suffered things that no one should ever have to see.""
The Welsh government has produced a welcome booklet which will be given to all refugees when they arrive.
It gives an overview of the country, its government, police, currency, climate and language, including a guide on how to pronounce common Welsh words: ""Bore da (Pronounced: Boh-reh dah): Good morning.""
It also gives advice on manners and customs in Wales, including guidance on how to greet people.
""British people are generally reserved and well mannered,"" it says.
""Neighbours greet each other politely, saying 'good morning or good afternoon' or 'bore da/prynhawn da' in Welsh, and often shake hands.""
It also says: ""Do not throw litter on the floor but use a public bin. It is considered very bad manners to spit on the floor in public places.
""If you need to sneeze or blow your nose, it is considered normal practice to use a tissue.
""Do not urinate in a public place other than a public toilet.""
Practical help is also given, including how to pay bills, help with schools and childcare, how to look for work, advice about driving and what to do if they experience hate crime, abuse or violence.
Refugees will be accommodated in private rented housing, arranged by councils. The Home Office will meet all of the costs of housing and any other support required.
This means there will be no direct impact on waiting lists or times for council and social housing.
Local people in many places have donated food, clothes and toys to help the families start their new lives.
All refugees will be required to learn English.
The Welsh government says this is ""important"" to help them feel part of their new community, to make friends and to access any important information and services.
Councils will arrange English classes for the refugees, with the costs met by the Home Office.
Children will go to local schools, with those already in Wales starting after the Christmas break.
Any educational support needed will be provided by the Home Office.
The refugees will have access to doctors and dentists, along with all the other services offered on the NHS.
Mr Williams said: ""The Home Office are funding the costs for the council and the health board - the costs will be reimbursed 100% for the first year but then tapering off during the following years.""
The Welsh Refugee Council (WRC) says local authorities are commissioning orientation services to support refugees and help them integrate into local communities.
""This will probably include some introduction to the local area, including places to worship,"" a spokeswoman said.
WRC says local communities are responding differently to welcome and settle refugee communities.
Volunteers in Torfaen, for example, have set up a support group and have made welcome hampers containing food and toiletries.
They also plan to provide advice about the area.
The Hay, Brecon and Talgarth Sanctuary for Refugees is another group which has been fundraising to help the resettlement.
In Ceredigion, the British Red Cross is providing daily support for refugees.
""We have been busy helping them with practical issues such as registering with a GP and signing tenancy agreements and also simple things like helping with their shopping,"" said Denise John, locality manager at the British Red Cross in Ceredigion.
""The families are settling into their homes very nicely and are incredibly grateful for the support they have received so far.
""The Red Cross will continue to provide both practical and emotional support to the refugees as they settle into life in Wales.""","The first refugees to arrive in Wales after fleeing war-torn Syria are ""happy"" and ""relieved to be here"", according to those helping to welcome them."
"The airline said that in future crew members would be allocated seats at least an hour before departure.
It comes after passenger Dr David Dao lost two front teeth and suffered a broken nose when he was forcibly removed from a flight last Sunday.
United Airlines said the move was aimed at improving its customer services.
The incident involving Dr Dao caused outrage and widespread condemnation of the airline after shocking footage was shared and watched by millions of people online.
His daughter, Crystal Dao Pepper, later told a news conference in Chicago that the family had been ""sickened"" by what had happened.
Law enforcement officials dragged Dr Dao off a flight departing from Chicago for Louisville, Kentucky, because it was fully booked, and the airline wanted four passengers to make way for staff members.
The 69-year-old Vietnamese-American physician had refused to leave, saying he needed to go home to see his patients. He was then dragged down the aisle of the aircraft.
His lawyer later said that Dr Dao found the experience ""more horrifying and harrowing than what he experienced when leaving Vietnam"".
The ordeal led to demonstrations at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and turned into a public relations disaster for United Airlines.
The situation escalated when a response from the airline's chief executive, Oscar Munoz, failed to mention any use of excessive force.
""This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologise for having to re-accommodate these customers,"" he said in a statement. He also said that Dr Dao was ""disruptive and belligerent"".
Days later Mr Munoz, who was facing calls to resign from online petitions that had received thousands of signatures, said he felt ""shame and embarrassment"" and vowed that it would never happen again.

Seven-time Grand Slam champion John McEnroe sums up the Championships at the All England Club rather well.
Pristine surfaces, the all-white dress code, strawberries and, most importantly, the world's best tennis players all striving for one of sport's most prestigious prizes.
And it is all about to start again. Here are the key things you need to know.
The gates open at Wimbledon on Monday, but the fun started a week ago.
Qualifying began on Monday, 26 June as lower-ranked players not automatically in the draw competed for the 16 remaining men's places and 12 women's spots.
Britain's Alex Ward, ranked world number 855, took one of them, but the likes of Marcus Willis, Liam Broady and Katy Dunne did not make it.
The seedings, given to the top 32 players in each singles draw, were announced on Wednesday.
Things really started getting moving on Friday, when the draw was made.
Play begins on the outside courts at 11:30 BST on Monday, before Britain's Andy Murray, the reigning men's champion, has the honour of opening on Centre Court at 13:00 BST.
Murray, Wimbledon champion in 2013 and 2016, has struggled with a hip injury in the lead-up to his title defence.
The world number one was forced him to pull out of two warm-up matches at the Hurlingham Club, but practised at the All England Club on Friday and Saturday.
And, putting aside his injury concerns, the Scot has been well short of his blistering form 12 months ago.
Media playback is not supported on this device
The Scot's start to the grass-court season has not been ideal - he lost his only match on the surface so far this year.
Murray, 30, won the Queen's title before both Wimbledon triumphs, but this month he suffered a surprise first-round defeat by Australian world number 90 Jordan Thompson at the Aegon Championships.
""There is no guarantee that I won't do well at Wimbledon, but it certainly would have helped to have had more matches,"" said Murray before his injury troubles.
Seven-time champion Roger Federer, fresh from winning his fourth title of the year at the Halle Open, is still seen by many as the man to beat.
The 35-year-old Swiss won the Australian Open in January - a record 18th Grand Slam title.
Another success at Wimbledon will put him clear of the men's record of seven singles titles he shares with Pete Sampras, and move him to within one of Martina Navratilova's all-time record of nine.
Federer's long-time rival Rafael Nadal is also among the Wimbledon favourites after winning his 10th French Open crown at Roland Garros.
Nadal, 31, has overcome his own injury problems to climb back up to second in the world rankings.
Novak Djokovic held all four Grand Slam titles going into last year's Championships. Now he holds none.
The 30-year-old Serb, who rediscovered some form by winning the Eastbourne title, has dropped to fourth in the world rankings after a troubled year in which he has split with his coaching team.
No Serena Williams and no Maria Sharapova. The ladies' draw might be lacking a bit of stardust without the sport's two biggest names - 22-time Grand Slam champion Williams is pregnant, Sharapova is injured - but that does not mean it will be any less exciting.
Will we see a new women's champion this year? More than likely. Only two former winners - Venus Williams and Petra Kvitova - are playing at SW19.
Kvitova - champion in 2011 and 2014 - would be a fairytale winner as she continues her return from a career-threatening hand injury sustained when she was stabbed by an intruder at her home.

The new girl on the block, 20-year-old French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko, might just stun everyone again, while Czech Karolina Pliskova will be feeling confident about her chances after winning the Eastbourne singles.
And then, of course, there's Britain's Johanna Konta (more on her next).
Like Murray, British women's number one Johanna Konta has seen her preparations marred by an injury scare.
Konta, ranked seventh in the world, said on Friday she was ""not 100% certain"" if she will be fit enough to play at Wimbledon after suffering a back injury.
The 26-year-old is aiming to raise hopes of a first female British winner since Virginia Wade in 1977.
Konta is the first top-10 British woman at Wimbledon since Jo Durie reached the quarter-finals in 1984, however she has only ever won one match in the main draw.
Her build-up to this year's tournament began with a run to the Nottingham Open final, where she lost to world number 70 Donna Vekic, a potential second-round opponent.
She then lost in the second round of Birmingham's Aegon Classic but then beat Ostapenko and world number one Angelique Kerber to reach the Eastbourne semi-finals, only to withdraw having suffered the injury late in her quarter-final win over Kerber.
Joining Murray and Konta in the main draw are 10 other British players.
Kyle Edmund and Aljaz Bedene qualified automatically as they are ranked inside the world's top 100, while seven players have been given wildcards.
Naomi Broady, Heather Watson, Laura Robson and Katie Boulter go into the women's draw, along with Brydan Klein, Cameron Norrie and James Ward in the men's.
Alex Ward, ranked world number 855, joined them after battling through three rounds of qualifying at Roehampton.
However, Dan Evans - ranked 50th in the world - will not play after revealing that he failed a drugs test in April.

Wimbledon remains one of the few major UK sporting events for which you can still buy tickets on the day of play.
That means, unless you've already bagged one in the ballot, you're going to have to join the famous queue.
Thousands of people gather daily in nearby Wimbledon Park to wait for a limited number of tickets which are available for Centre Court, Court One and Court Two (except for the last four days on Centre Court, when all are sold in advance).
Several thousand ground passes, meaning fans can use unreserved seating and standing room on courts three to 18, are available each day at the turnstiles.
But don't rely on using your debit card to pay for them - it is cash only.
Not got a ticket? Can't be bothered with the queue? Don't worry, because there will be more than 150 hours of coverage on BBC One and BBC Two over two weeks, plus 100 hours of action on BBC Radio 5 live.
Sue Barker will once again be at the helm, while three-time Wimbledon champion Boris Becker returns to our commentary team alongside Pat Cash, Annabel Croft, Tim Henman and John McEnroe and many more.
You can also take control of the coverage yourself by choosing between up to 15 live HD streams on your smartphone, tablet and connected TVs.
Murray will once again give us an exclusive insight into his Wimbledon campaign with his column for the BBC Sport website.
There will also be a range of content on BBC Sport's Twitter,Facebook and Instagram accounts - and, as always, we want you to get involved.
This year is a special anniversary as The Championships marks 90 years of coverage on the BBC.

""The problem is mine,"" McIlroy said. ""The wedding invitations issued at the weekend made me realise that I wasn't ready for all that marriage entails.""
The couple had been together for more than two years.
McIlroy is currently at Wentworth for the BMW PGA Championship, the European Tour's flagship event which starts on Thursday.
Wozniacki is set to compete in the French Open in Paris starting on 25 May.
In a statement issued through his management company, McIlroy added: ""There is no right way to end a relationship that has been so important to two people.
""I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we have had.""
""The news has shocked the worlds of both golf and tennis, particularly with the timing of the split. McIlroy is due to start a crucial run of tournaments, while Wozniacki is playing the upcoming French Open.""
Speaking at Wentworth on Wednesday, McIlroy said the decision to end the engagement had been mutual and amicable.
He said it was a difficult time, but that the move was best for both of them.
McIlroy won the US Open in 2011 and US PGA Championship the following year.
Wozniacki, who has reached the final of one grand slam tournament - the US Open in 2009 - is currently ranked 13th in the world.

"Trains were stopped at the border for hours - prompting Italy to launch an official complaint with France. Services were later resumed.
Italy has angered France by giving temporary resident permits to thousands of Tunisian migrants.
The permits allow them to travel freely in many European countries.
The Italian foreign ministry said the French move was ""illegitimate and in clear violation of general European principles"".
Speaking earlier on Sunday, Maurizio Furia, a spokesman for the Italian rail company, said that trains were not being allowed to pass into Menton, France, from the Italian border station of Ventimiglia.
The BBC's Hugh Schofield says a demonstration in support of the Tunisian immigrants had been planned, in which some 300 protesters had planned to ride what they dubbed ""the train of dignity"".
Because of the closure, the demonstration was unable to take place.
France has said migrants have to prove they can support themselves financially and has set up patrols on the Italian border.
But Italy says that France's actions are not in line with the EU's Schengen passport-free travel zone.
""We have given the migrants travel documents, and we gave everything (else) that is needed, and the European Commission recognised that, it has said that Italy is following the Schengen rules,"" Italian Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said in an interview on Italy's Sky TG24 TV.
Italy and other European countries have been increasingly concerned about migration from north Africa following the political turmoil in the region.

"United manager Jose Mourinho is keen on the 22-year-old, who can play at centre-half or right-back.
A group from Benfica is reported to have travelled to England on Monday to discuss a potential transfer with the Premier League club.
United have not commented but Vitoria said: ""If there are exits we will find solutions.""
Reports suggest he would become the club's most expensive defender of all time, costing between £38m and £42m. Their record is England international Rio Ferdinand's £29.1m move to Old Trafford from Leeds in 2002.
Lindelof, who has 11 caps for Sweden, played in Benfica's Portuguese league game against Rio Ave on Wednesday, their last game for two weeks.
His agent Hasan Cetinkaya told Swedish media there was ""a bid on Benfica's table"" and that he would be meeting with the club, but refused to comment when asked specifically about an offer from Manchester United.
Mourinho, who spent more than £150m on players in the summer, is keen to make changes to his squad during the January transfer window.
Although the Portuguese has said he will not force anyone out, midfielders Morgan Schneiderlin and Bastian Schweinsteiger are the most likely to depart, along with Memphis Depay.
France international Schneiderlin, 27, has attracted interest from Everton, as has Netherlands winger Depay, although Italian side Roma are another club keeping an eye on the 22-year-old.
Former Germany captain Schweinsteiger spoke to MLS outfit Chicago Fire, with other US clubs also keen on taking the World Cup winner, who has returned to first-team training after being frozen out by Mourinho at the start of the season.",Benfica coach Rui Vitoria has not ruled out Sweden defender Victor Lindelof joining Manchester United next month.
"He last played in September and was put on a training regime after being ruled unfit and overweight.
""I have had a good, constructive talk with Tony and the senior management and we all agree this is the best way forward for me,"" said the 23-year-old.
Baggies boss Tony Pulis has said that Berahino is ""close"" to a return.
The former England Under-21 international's form has suffered since he reacted angrily to a bid from Tottenham being turned down on transfer deadline day in summer 2015.
He scored seven times in 35 games last season, compared to 20 goals in 45 appearances in 2014-15, after threatening to not play for club chairman Jeremy Peace.
""This last year has been the most difficult of my career and it has left me short of the form and fitness required for the Premier League,"" said Berahino.
""I have never been a player who lacked confidence or a belief in himself but that has been where I have found myself and it has hit me hard.
""It has left me feeling depressed and struggling for focus which has made it even more difficult to regain full fitness.""
In a statement, the club said it hopes the ""change of environment"" at the camp in the south of France will help Berahino return to full fitness.
West Brom host Burnley in the Premier League on Monday with full commentary available on BBC Radio 5 live from 20:00 GMT.",West Brom striker Saido Berahino says he is in a positive frame of mind despite being sent back to a conditioning camp in France.
"Aaron Lennon is still missing but Muhamed Besic is nearing a first-team return following nine months out with a serious knee injury.
Burnley midfielder Steven Defour is fit, having played only twice in 10 weeks because of various injuries.
Johann Berg Gudmundsson has stepped up his recovery from knee ligament damage but might not be risked.
Guy Mowbray: ""Everton are hunting a new club record for successive Premier League home wins, against a Burnley side still seeking ANY away win.
""The Clarets have three chances left, with the last (and furthest!) trip to Bournemouth probably their best bet - assuming both are safe from relegation by the season's penultimate weekend.
""With one win in nine since January, it's testament to how well Burnley did earlier in the season that they'll surely be okay by then.
""The FA Cup semi-finals line-up should mean that Everton are sitting pretty for a Europa League place, and whilst a strong finish won't get them in the top four it might prove key to keeping Romelu Lukaku.""
Twitter: @Guymowbray
Everton manager Ronald Koeman on his players' ambitions: ""If you ask the players one by one, everyone will mention they like to play Champions League: for every manager, for every player and also the fans.
""Our next step is to play in Europe. It will be difficult but if we finish fifth or sixth it would be perfect as you don't play any qualification games for the Europa League.""
Burnley manager Sean Dyche on Michael Keane's PFA Young Player of the Year nomination: ""It's a great sign for him and he deserves to be in that company.
""We're not shining lights of the Premier League or a superpower, so for other players to see that and say 'hang on a minute, he's been terrific in a smaller side at a smaller club' is good, it's good of his peers to recognise that.
""He's in some very good company, some players who are having absolutely fine seasons, and he's having a very strong season too.""
Since suffering their only home league defeat of the season, against Liverpool in December, the Toffees have won seven league games in a row at Goodison Park.
I think Everton's excellent run will continue - and maybe Ross Barkley will deliver the knock-out blow.

"Sunderland forward Duncan Watmore was on the fishing boat in Barbados when it was hit, and broken in two, by a catamaran.
He managed to haul three elderly passengers out of the water from the boat just before it sank.
His father, Ian Watmore, said the catamaran had ""just ploughed straight into the boat and ripped it in half"".
""They saw it and just assumed it was going to go round them and, when they realised it was coming straight at them, they started yelling and screaming but nothing changed,"" he said.
""These catamarans are quite powerful and the blade just ripped the thing in half.""
Watmore had been in Barbados in February, recovering from an operation on a cruciate knee ligament injury, when the crash happened.
One of the guests on the boat had just had a hip replacement, one could not swim and the other was over 80, his father said.
After the crash, his son ""clambered up on to the catamaran"" and lifted them, and the skipper, out of the water just as their fishing boat sank, he said.

"The male hedgehog, who had inflated to twice its size, was found wandering around in circles by a member of the public in Toll Bar, Doncaster.
The unnamed animal was diagnosed with the rare ""balloon syndrome"", caused by gas collecting under the skin.
He was taken to a RSPCA centre in Cheshire where a needle was inserted to vent the trapped air.
More news from across Yorkshire
Bev Panto, head vet at the RSPCA's Stapeley Grange centre, said it was a very unusual syndrome.
""In my career I have seen three or four of these cases and they are very strange every time and quite shocking,"" she said.

She said the condition only occurs in hedgehogs and was due to their ability to curl up, meaning they have a lot of space under the skin.

"From 2019-20, the Football League wants a fifth division with 20 teams in each.
Initial reaction was one of outrage from some clubs at how they found out about the plan.
Given 90% - 65 out of the 72 - of the Football League clubs need to vote in favour, that seems like a mistake.
The Football League insisted it sent documentation on its proposals to all member clubs on Thursday lunchtime, but senior officials of two Championship clubs say they were unaware of the proposals until they were reported by the media.
The positive argument put forward for reducing the number of teams in each league is that there would be less need for midweek games, when attendances are smaller.
It would also reduce the number of away games and, as a result, the travel costs of both clubs and supporters.
""That is an utterly ridiculous argument,"" said one Championship chairman.
""For the best-supported clubs, four home league games amounts to between £1.5m and £2m in gate receipts. For away games, our bill is around £2,000 each time.
""So, basically what they are saying is give up over £1m and you will save £8,000. Are you being serious?""
In 1994-95, the Premier League needed to reduce from 22 clubs to 20.
It was managed in one season, by relegating the bottom four clubs and promoting only two from the First Division. The process continued down to the Third Division, which expanded from 22 teams to 24.
Reducing a league from 24 to 20 could be done with four relegated clubs and none promoted, five and one, six and two or seven and three.
Then you would need to reduce the third tier by eight and the fourth by 12.
The best eight National League sides could make up the rump of League Three.
An even more radical option would be for eight Premier League reserve teams to be asked to make up the numbers.
It is the kind of idea FA chairman Greg Dyke proposed in 2014 - only for it to be instantly rejected by the Football League.
However, the presence of eight well-supported 'reserve' teams may widen interest and could be a way of filling the gap in funding created by those eight fewer games.
There are various ways of getting there, but the brutal fact is four Championship clubs are going to get axed from the division.
Current solidarity payments for Championship clubs not in receipt of parachute payments are £2.3m. For League One clubs it is £360,000 and League Two £240,000.
When the new £5.1bn Premier League TV deal comes into force in August, Championship clubs will get a solidarity payment equivalent to 30% of a third-year parachute payment. League One and League Two clubs will receive 4.5% and 3% of a third-year payment.
If the current £10m third-year parachute payment remained the same, there would be a difference of around £2.5m.
""Why would anyone who had a chance of being relegated from the Championship vote for that?"" said the same chairman. ""It is the ultimate turkeys voting for Christmas scenario.""
Smaller squads for fewer games? Not necessarily.
""Unless I am missing something, we would still need 11 starters and seven substitutes,"" said the Championship chairman. ""You can't pick and choose when your players get injured. I don't think we would be able to reduce our squad by a single player.""
Winter break? Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger spent years calling for a winter break, with the backing of almost every manager. The argument is that the England team would benefit as players would be resting when the pitches were at their heaviest.
Goalkeeper Robert Green, then of West Ham, was the last Championship player to play for England, in 2012. The last outfield player was striker Jay Bothroyd, then of Cardiff, in 2010.
""You are not telling me this would not have any impact on the England team,"" the chairman added.
Questions are being asked about the Football League hierarchy's wisdom in bringing forward these proposals - and what they are doing to increase revenues.
In 2000, the Football League agreed an ill-fated £315m three-year deal with ITV Digital.
Viewing figures were poor and ITV Digital ended up going bust.
Sky picked up the TV rights in 2002, paying £95m over four years. Its present deal is estimated to cost £80m a year.
So effectively, the Football League clubs are getting 25% less than they were anticipating 16 years ago. On average, they are receiving £796,000 more than they did 14 years ago, when they rushed through a deal in desperation.
""It would not surprise me in the slightest if we started to hear talk of Premier League II again,"" said the Championship chairman.
""If this is the best the Football League can come up with, we need to start looking at alternatives.""
The brainchild of former Bolton chairman Phil Gartside in 2008, the idea was for a second league of 20 to move within the Premier League umbrella. Its most controversial aspect was going to be the introduction of Old Firm pair Celtic and Rangers into the league.
As an idea, it never got off the ground. For almost every team in the Premier League, there was a reason to stop Celtic and Rangers joining their competition.
Could the passage of time, and even more overseas owners, weaken the resistance?

A previous council attempt to cut congestion by banning motorists from using Lendal Bridge across the River Ouse was abandoned last year.
Mr Gillies said the city had an air pollution problem but could come up with a solution itself.
""Let's take stock and see if there's anything we can do,"" he said. ""I don't believe bringing somebody in to have a traffic congestion commission is money well spent.

By 1996 the pharmacy chain had grown to 11 pharmacies and in 2006 the business expanded into Scotland where there are now nine stores.
Today, the chain has 62 stores and employs approximately 800 people.
Neil Gordon was born on 17 October 1952 in Newry, County Down.
The son of a farmer, and one of five brothers, his interest in pharmacy was sparked at a young age.
He was educated at Newry Model Primary school and Newry Grammar school before studying pharmacy at Bradford University.
After a period of employment that included working in England, Neil established the first Gordons Chemists in Donaghadee in 1980.
He was also a co-founder of the Donaghadee Comunity Workforce, assisting the long-term unemployed back into employment, while engaging in work of community benefit.
He served as an elder at Shore Street Presbyterian Church, Donaghadee and was a trustee of the Lighthouse Trust, a charity serving children with cerebral palsy.
Neil was elected to the executive committee of Belfast city centre management in 2004 and served until his death.
He was elected to the board of the PCC (Pharmaceutical Contractors Committee), the committee responsible for negotiating community pharmacy services with the Department of Health, and served for seven years.
He also served on the board of SOS Bus NI, a charity helping vulnerable people on the streets of Belfast.
In 2013, Neil was awarded a Fellowship of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.

"It is the work of street artist Joe Caslin, who rose to public attention during last year's same-sex marriage referendum in the Republic of Ireland.
The Belfast artwork is similar in style to another huge mural of his in Dublin, which depicts two young men embracing.
The artist said he felt the time was right to take the campaign to Belfast.
""Northern Ireland is the only territory now on the islands of western Europe that doesn't have same sex marriage - and it's same-sex marriage not civil partnership,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster.
""Through the work that I did in Dublin last year with the referendum and the large piece we put up on George's Street, I felt it was an ideal time, coming up to the Pride Festival that takes place this weekend, to reignite that conversation.""
The street artist, from County Roscommon, also works as an art teacher at a secondary school in County Offaly.
He said he received a positive reaction from many members of the public in Belfast who stopped to watch him work on the mural in Hill Street.
The new mural, entitled Love Wins, features an embrace between two women who live in Belfast.
""They travelled to America to get married last year,"" the artist said.
The pair could not have held the ceremony in their home town.
Same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales in March 2014 and in Scotland, the first gay weddings took place on 31 December 2014.
In May 2015, the Republic of Ireland became the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage through a popular vote, with the law taking effect in November last year.
Earlier this month, a couple from the Isle of Man became the first to change their civil partnership into a marriage on the island.
The Northern Ireland Assembly has held a number of votes on the issue and last year, for the first time, a majority voted in favour by the narrowest of margins.
MLAs supported the motion by 53 votes to 52, but it was blocked after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) deployed a petition of concern that required the proposal to achieve a cross-community majority.

The Dutchman was unhappy at what he saw as an overreaction to challenges from his players.
""I don't like coaches from the bench the whole time shouting to referees and linesmen, making a big show about tackles. They were crazy,"" said Koeman.
""According to their bench, the referee should have shown eight red cards.""

Liverpool-Everton games have seen 21 red cards in the Premier League era, more than any other fixture.
In a game where goals from Sadio Mane, Philippe Coutinho and Divock Origi took Liverpool third, four yellow cards were shown.

"The two firms should be barred from any US mergers and acquisitions, according to a House Intelligence Committee report.
The panel says the firms failed to allay fears about their association with China's government and military.
Huawei and ZTE denied the accusations in front of the panel in September.
On Monday ZTE issued a statement insisting its equipment met all US standards and posed no threat.
""ZTE has set an unprecedented standard for co-operation by any Chinese company with a congressional investigation,"" China's Xinhua news agency quoted the firm as saying.
How China became the US election bogeyman
Huawei's vice-president, William Plummer, said the latest accusations were ""dangerous political distractions"".
""Purporting that Huawei is somehow uniquely vulnerable to cyber mischief ignores technical and commercial realities, recklessly threatens American jobs and innovation, does nothing to protect national security.""
While the House Intelligence report stopped short of calling for a boycott of the firms' mobile phone products, it was highly critical of the two companies.
""China has the means, opportunity and motive to use telecommunications companies for malicious purposes,"" the report says.
""Based on available classified and unclassified information, Huawei and ZTE cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems.""
The panel said their investigation had received credible allegations from current and former Huawei employees of bribery and corruption, discriminatory behaviour and copyright infringement.
Republican committee chairman Mike Rogers said they had passed on information to the FBI to investigate the allegations.
""We've come to the conclusion, unfortunately, they are not private entities,"" Mr Rogers said on Monday.
On Sunday, Mr Rogers delivered a blunt verdict to the 60 Minutes programme on US network CBS.
""If I were an American company today... and you are looking at Huawei, I would find another vendor if you care about your intellectual property, if you care about your consumers' privacy, and you care about the national security of the United States of America,"" he said.
Among the report's recommendations were to exclude any Huawei or ZTE equipment or component parts from being used by government contractors, as well both companies becoming ""more transparent and responsive to US legal obligations"".
China's Foreign Ministry urged the US to ""set aside prejudices"" regarding the two firms.
""Chinese telecoms companies have been developing their international business based on market economy principles,"" ministry spokesman Hong Lei said.
""Their investment in the United States embodies the mutually beneficial nature of Sino-American economic and trade relations.""
Huawei was started by Ren Zhengfei, a former member of the People's Liberation Army, in 1987.
As the firm has grown to become one of the largest global players in the sector, fears about its ties with the Chinese military have frequently surfaced.
There have been concerns and allegations that it was helping China gather information on foreign states and companies, charges that the firm has denied.
Last year, its purchase of American computer company 3Leaf systems, was rejected by a US security panel.
Earlier this year, it along with ZTE, faced allegations that some of their equipment had been installed with codes to relay sensitive information back to China.
Senior executives from the two companies denied those allegations when they appeared before US lawmakers in September.
ZTE is also facing accusations it sold US telecoms equipment to Iran, in breach of US sanctions. Telecoms giant Cisco on Monday ended its relationship with ZTE, Reuters reported, after its equipment was included in the Tehran deal.
This latest report comes in the midst of a US presidential campaign in which China has become a hot topic.
Both President Barack Obama and his Republican challenger Mitt Romney have pledged to increase the pressure on Beijing on issues ranging from China's currency policy to state subsidies for Chinese firms.
Earlier this month, Mr Obama signed an order blocking a deal by a Chinese firm, Ralls Corp, to acquire four wind farm projects near a US naval facility in Oregon.
It was the first foreign investment to be blocked in the US for 22 years.
The Chinese firm has since sued Mr Obama, alleging the US government overstepped its authority.","Chinese telecom firms Huawei and ZTE pose a security threat to the US, a congressional panel has warned after an investigation into the two companies."

Ms Yellen also noted that the US has seen an unusual rise in its death rate.
""It's obviously a very serious and heartbreaking problem,"" she said.
It was Ms Yellen's second day of testimony before lawmakers, who asked questions about monetary policy, prospects for economic outlook and other issues.
Economists have puzzled over the fall in labour force participation rates, the share of people working or looking for work.
For the over-16 civilian population, they have declined from a peak of about 67% in the late 1990s to less than 63% today, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Among men, the rates have fallen from about 80% in the late 1960s to less than 70% today. They have risen among women from about 42% to nearly 57% during that time.
Ms Yellen on Wednesday said she believed an aging population was a major factor in the overall decline.
She also said men with less education have been particularly affected by technological changes that reduce jobs in some industries.
Some economists also argue that video games are to blame.
Ms Yellen's remarks came on the same day that top US prosecutor Jeff Sessions announced charges against more than 120 people, including doctors, related to prescription drugs.
The charges were part of a more sweeping crackdown on Medicaid fraud.","Widespread opioid abuse is tied to a fall in the share of Americans working or looking for work, the head of the US central bank said on Thursday."

Top scorer Adam Rooney fastened on to a mistake by Dare Vrsic, but the striker's shot was indecisive and Handanovic saved at the second attempt.
The visitors then squandered the best early chance after a great run and cross on the counter-attack by right-back Denis Sme, Marwan Kabha sending his shot from 12 yards hopelessly over the bar when he should have scored.
Handanovic made a brave block at Rooney's feet and then saw the same player miss an excellent Andrew Considine delivery by inches as crosses kept flashing across his penalty box.
The keeper again excelled by blocking Jayden Stockley's header at point-blank range just before the break.
Vrsic caused a few moments of anxiety for Aberdeen when stopper Joe Lewis was forced to make a sharp dive to his left to prevent the former Austria Vienna player netting.
Rooney did have the ball in the net after some great build-up play by Niall McGinn but the striker had strayed offside. Then, with time running out, Novakovic struck.
It was a wonderful finish from the 37-year-old as he brushed off the challenge of Ash Taylor before arrowing a shot beyond the despairing dive of Lewis.
But Taylor redeemed himself with a determined contribution to set up Hayes' sidefoot finish minutes later.
That gives Aberdeen greater hope of reaching the play-off round, but Maribor know they will progress if they avoid losing a goal next week.",Aberdeen struck late in Europe again as Jonny Hayes equalised against Maribor in the Europa League third qualifying round first leg.
"The party called for an armed forces commissioner and better assessment to deliver the services veterans need.
Social justice spokesman Mark Isherwood said it was ""time for us to reflect as a society"" on treatment of veterans.
Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant said the Welsh Government was ""fully committed"" to providing support.
The debate on Wednesday comes amid continued concern that many military veterans suffer from mental health issues, loneliness, welfare or addiction problems, or have trouble finding work or housing.
""It's not enough just to rely on organisations like the Royal British Legion to raise money and campaign for the 385,000 members of the current and former service community currently living in Wales,"" Mr Isherwood said.
""As politicians we have to raise our game, and make sure that each and every level of government is playing its part.
""We are 100 years on from the Battle of the Somme,"" he added.
""The commemorations this year have been a poignant reminder of the need to protect these heroes, and to ensure that those who have served in the armed forces, and their families, are treated with fairness and respect.""
Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said:  ""All Welsh public bodies have signed up to the Armed Forces Covenant, but it's clear that we have a long way to go to redress the disadvantages faced by this section of the community.
""In Scotland, a Veterans Commissioner champions the needs of the armed forces community.
""We want to go one step further here in Wales, and create an armed forces commissioner for Wales, dedicated both to veterans and the wider armed forces community.""
Communities Secretary Carl Sargeant outlined the Welsh Government's support for the armed forces to the Senedd on Tuesday.
It included support on health needs, housing and employment.
""This time of the year particularly reminds us of all those who have fought in conflicts to preserve the way of life we have today,"" he said.
""This year we have commemorated some of the biggest battles of the First World War.  We remember those who lost their lives at Jutland and during the Battle of the Somme, especially in Mametz Wood; thousands of Welsh Servicemen made the ultimate sacrifice.
""Through our Programme for Government we remain fully committed to providing ongoing support and services for our present Armed Forces community.""","War veterans and members of the armed forces need to be treated better by society, the Welsh Conservatives have said ahead of a debate in the Senedd."
"Farc leader Ivan Marquez said the group would start by making an inventory of its weapons before handing them over to United Nations monitors.
He said it was a sign of the Farc's ""unconditional commitment to peace"" after more than 50 years of conflict.
The government has yet to reach a peace deal with the ELN rebel group.
The Farc said its fighters would register their weapons with UN monitors and reveal the location of any stashed explosives.
Almost 7,000 rebels are now gathered in 26 transition zones where they are being registered and offered help to reintegrate into civilian life.
But it took months rather than weeks to get them there because of what the government said were logistical difficulties.
And when they arrived many Farc members complained the camps were unfinished and they had to build their own accommodation.
The Colombian government and the Farc insist that by 30 May - the date set in the peace accord for the disarmament process to be completed - all the guerrillas will be leaving the transition zones and entering civilian life.
But there have been serious delays, and the government and the rebels are trying to reassure Colombians that the peace process is still on track.
According to the original plan, the Farc were supposed to hand over 30% of their arms on 1 March.
But now only 320 rebels are set to disarm by the end of Wednesday, far short of the original target.
However, both the government and the Farc insist the disarmament will be completed in time and that they will meet the May deadline.",Colombia's Farc rebels say they will begin laying down their arms later on Wednesday as agreed in a peace deal signed in November.
"A recording, which a US website claims was Gibson on the phone to Oksana Grigorieva, has emerged. He is allegedly heard verbally abusing her.
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Steve Whitmore said officers will ""review"" the recordings as part of an investigation.

""Anything that is connected to the case we will investigate,"" Mr Whitmore said.

"The money is to help ""build the global reach of the World Service"" to half a billion people and ""increase access to news and information"".
Director general Tony Hall said he ""warmly welcomed"" the announcement.
The government will provide £34m between 2016-17 and £85m a year from 2017-18 for digital, TV and radio.
The next review of this funding will be in 2020.
""This new funding is the single biggest increase in the World Service budget ever committed by any government,"" said Lord Hall.
""The millions announced today will help the BBC deliver on our commitment to uphold global democracy through accurate, impartial and independent news reporting.
""The World Service is one of the UK's most important cultural exports and one of our best sources of global influence.  We can now further build on that.""
He added: ""The funding will also help speed us on to our target of reaching half a billion people globally.""
The BBC currently reaches 308 million people worldwide, and its goal is to reach 500 million people by 2022.
Announcing the new funding in its document the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review, the government said: ""The BBC World Service reaches into some of the most remote places in the world, providing a link to the UK for individuals and societies who would otherwise not have this opportunity.
""We will invest £85 million each year by in the BBC's digital, TV and radio services around the world to build the global reach of the World Service and increase access to news and information.""
The announcement on page 49 of the Government's Strategic Defence Review makes it very clear what this money is all about - soft power.   Britain's reputation, values and influence around the World.
In 2010, the coalition government decided the £253 million spent on the World Service was coming to an end.  The BBC would have to absorb the cost out of the licence fee.
Five years later, Chancellor George Osborne has, partially, reversed that cut in return for the BBC expanding services in to North Korea,  Russian speaking areas, the Middle East and Africa.
Areas described as suffering from a ""democratic deficit"" - a shortage of impartial news.
And while the Government will be helping to pay the bills - editorial control remains entirely with the BBC.
And there is also another factor which may have influenced this decision to promote Britain abroad -  the rapid growth of rival international news services from Russia, China and the Middle East.
The BBC's radio services around the world are in decline - the new cash will help the switch towards more TV, mobile and online services as the BBC seeks to grow its global reach from around 300 million at the moment to a target of 500 million.
The list of services to be expanded using the funding include enhanced TV services for Africa, new radio services for audiences in North Korea and radio and digital services for Ethiopia and Eritrea.
Details of which languages the BBC will broadcast in to Ethiopia and Eritrea will be announced later.
The BBC will also expand TV, radio and digital offerings in Somalia, India, Nigeria and Thailand.
A TV service will be added to the existing service for Somalia.
For Nigeria, a digital service will be started in Pidgin and Yoruba.
""Pidgin is a popular language among young people in Nigeria and across West Africa,"" said Liliane Landor, controller of languages at the World Service.
It will also help boost digital and TV services for Russian speakers, both in Russia and the surrounding communities.","The government is to invest £85m a year in enhancing BBC services around the world including in Russia, North Korea, the Middle East and Africa."
"But occasionally I also have to take issue with the use of much bigger surveys, such as the country's biggest household one, the Labour Force Survey (LFS).
One of its main uses is in the production of the unemployment figures every month.
It used to be that the headline unemployment figure was the number of people claiming out-of-work benefits, but that meant the figures were vulnerable to changes in who was allowed to claim such benefits, so instead the country switched to the International Labour Organisation's definition of unemployment, which is people out of work and seeking a job, whether or not they are claiming benefits.
As I reported a few weeks ago, the claimant count has lost its national statistic designation, because the introduction of universal credit has made it more difficult to calculate.
But our headline unemployment figure comes from the LFS, in which the Office for National Statistics (ONS) speaks to 60,000 households once a quarter. It's a big survey, but it's still a survey. The ONS is very clear in its monthly releases about its limitations.
Two weeks ago we had the unemployment figures for the three months from March to May, which it turned out had risen by 15,000 compared with the previous three months.
But lower down in the release, readers were warned that the ONS was 95% confident that the actual figure was within plus or minus 80,000 of that mark, so between a rise of 95,000 and a fall of 65,000.
Which may make you question our top line, that unemployment had risen for the first time in two years.
Unemployment is not the only figure taken from the LFS, and there was some interesting analysis done by Migration Watch last week using the survey.
The group said its research showed that groups of migrants with weaker economic characteristics (based on level of employment, rates of pay and likelihood to claim benefits) outnumbered those with stronger economic characteristics by two to one.
The House of Commons Library has been looking at this analysis and questioning whether the LFS is a robust enough source to make such claims.
As an example, it considers the figure given for the gap in likelihood to claim benefits between UK residents born in the UK, and those born in Pakistan or Bangladesh, between the ages of 40 and 44.
It says that despite its huge sample size, the LFS is only likely to have interviewed about 27 people who fall into the category of 40 to 44 year-old benefit claimants born in Pakistan or Bangladesh.
The Library suggests: ""a nuanced narrative might be more appropriate than broad statements about migrants' likelihood to claim"".",A lot of the stories I am asked to look at involve organisations trying to make big claims based on surveys of tiny numbers of people with questionable methodology.
"International recognition and protection of such areas is urgently needed to halt their continued loss, say scientists.
Roads may introduce many problems to nature, including deforestation, pollution and risks to wildlife.
Areas untouched by roads do not have adequate protection in most countries, researchers report in Science journal.
""We have produced a global map of road less areas,"" said lead researcher Pierre Ibisch, of Eberswalde University for Sustainable Development, in Germany.
""And this map shows that Earth's landscapes are shattered into more than 600 thousand fragments.
""We used a huge dataset of 36 million km of roads for producing this map.""
Roads are important for economic development, but they have a number of potential environmental impacts, including deforestation, chemical pollution, and noise disturbance.
To gain a better understanding of the impact of road systems, scientists analysed two global datasets, OpenStreetMap and gRoads. They also reviewed 282 publications.
The map found that about 80% of the Earth's land surface remains without roads.
However, more than half of the 600,000 fragments created by roads are less than 1 sq km.
Only 7% are larger than 100 sq km (400 sq miles) - that's about the size of the island of Montserrat.
As roads continue to expand there is an urgent need for a global strategy for the conservation, restoration and monitoring of areas without roads and the ecosystems they represent, say scientists from 12 institutions in six countries.
Few countries have legislation that protects areas that are not fragmented by roads.
And in much of Europe and North America these areas have already been lost.
However, in Australia, for example, untouched landscapes such as the Blue Mountains only hours from Sydney still exist.
Dr Ibisch told BBC News: ''We see these road less areas as areas with an inherent value; something that merits being seen as a conservation target in its own right.''
Co-researcher Monika Hoffmann added: ""Road less areas are still overestimated and many of them are reduced in size.""
The research is published in the journal Science.

"Officers recovered £800,000 worth of the drug during 10 searches in Belfast, Greenisland, Bangor, Newtownards and Ballywalter. Six people were arrested.
Two people were also arrested in the Prato and Bologna areas of Italy.
Police said those arrested were believed to be ""significant members"" of a crime gang.
The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said the gang had been involved in money laundering and drugs trafficking activities.
The six people arrested in Northern Ireland were four men and two women, with ages ranging from 26 years to 33 years old.
They are being questioned on suspicion of the importation of cannabis and conspiracy to supply cannabis and money laundering.
Three searches were carried out in the Prato and Bologna areas of Italy.
The PSNI is the lead investigator in the operation, which involved officers from the Italian Carabiniere and the National Crime Agency.
The officer leading the investigation, Det Insp Andy Dunlop from the PSNI's organised crime branch, said: ""We believe we have established the source of a major supply of herbal cannabis trafficked into Northern Ireland.
""This is a substantial multi-agency international investigation which has involved various investigative tactics and methods - resulting in these searches, seizures and arrests.
""We have seized £800,000 of herbal cannabis but our enquiries lead us to believe that much more has already been sent from Italy to Northern Ireland.

"So-called mathematics anxiety was found especially in countries which were more developed and where males and females were considered more or less equal.
University of Glasgow researchers looked at achievements, attitudes and emotions around maths and found girls showed more negative emotion about it.
Data was collected from 500,000 15-year-olds in 68 countries.
Mathematics anxiety is defined as ""negative feelings experienced during the preparation of and engagement in maths activities"".
Academics, led by Dr Gijsbert Stoet, from Glasgow University's school of education, said it did not seem to matter whether the girls' mothers worked in related fields and that efforts to attract more women into science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects had largely failed.
Dr Liberty Vittert, a lecturer at the School of Maths and Statistics at University of Glasgow, told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that mathematics anxiety could hamper future job prospects.
Dr Vittert said: ""When I was about 14, I had a maths teacher who called my parents into school to say that I couldn't do maths and I should stop and there was no point in further continuing with it.
""It really stops you with jobs if you stop with maths young.
""So I pushed through and I had an undergrad in pure mathematics from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and now I have my Phd. So I think it's very important, but I think there's a lot of pressure on young girls to not do some subjects.""
Asked if maths had caused her anxiety at school, she said: ""Absolutely. I think when you have teachers or other authority figures telling you that you can't do something, of course it creates huge anxiety.
""And clearly there are pressures on a young girl not to do these things.""
She added: ""If you think about maths, there is always a right or a wrong answer. Whereas in some subjects such as English, there aren't always right or wrong answers.
""So if you can't get that exact answer, the teacher can just say, 'Well you don't know what you're doing, you're not smart.'
""Whereas maybe you just don't quite get it.  In English you can have varying levels of understanding.""","Girls are ""more afraid"" of mathematics than boys in 80% of countries, according to a new study."
"Tui, owner of Thomson and First Choice, was fined 48 times during 2015 and 2016 by the travel association Abta.
The breaches included inaccurate advertising and sending holidaymakers to resorts where significant building work was being carried out.
Tui said it was committed to resolving any issue a customer experiences.
The figures, compiled from industry data by You & Yours on Radio 4, show Tui's most recent fine of £1,500 was imposed in December 2016 for cancelling a customer's travel arrangements after the holiday had already been paid for in full.
Many of the other fines were for failing to respond quickly enough to correspondence.
However, three of them were for not telling customers about significant building works at their resorts before they went on holiday.
Abta's code of conduct states customers should be told about building work in advance, or offered alternative travel arrangements or a full refund if the alternative would constitute a significant alteration to their holiday.
Despite being fined, Tui has continued to send some holidaymakers to building sites without warning.
In November 2016, Keith Parkins from Guildford in Surrey went to Tenerife with Tui's company Thomson. He arrived to find significant construction work underway at his hotel.
""The arrival was, to put it bluntly, a shock,"" he said. ""Coming down the hill, the first thing you could see was the long sun terrace, digger, bulldozer, piles of rubble, workmen, wheelbarrows, you name it. Inside, most of the hotel was taped off.
The very first morning, I was woken up after 07:00 by the horrendous racket of pneumatic drills. It was just unbelievable.""
Thomson has offered Mr Parkins a £250 refund or a £345 travel voucher. He thinks it is insufficient, as he paid £1,762 for his holiday and is not keen on travelling with the company again.
Other firms fined for breaches of the Abta code include Tui's biggest rival, Thomas Cook.
It was fined on 24 occasions during 2015 and 2016, often for failing to deal with customer's complaints or for not paying arbitration awards on time.
In total, it was charged £10,750. Tui was fined a total of £38,500 over the same period.
""You really need to look at the percentage of problems you are seeing in terms of the total number of people they take away,"" said Sean Tipton from Abta.
""If it is just a one-off problem, obviously that's not good enough for you as the holidaymaker, but it doesn't necessarily represent a systemic problem with the company.""
In a statement, Tui said the vast majority of its customers have a ""great holiday"", adding: ""We are sorry to hear if a holiday falls short of expectations or is impacted by circumstances, which are sometimes beyond our control. We remain committed to resolving any issue a customer experiences.""
Thomas Cook said: ""We aim for zero breaches of the Abta code and we continue to improve the business and put our customer at the heart of everything we do.""
""We would like to see no breaches of the code as well,"" said Abta's Sean Tipton.
""The point is, when they do occur, it is essential the tour operator does their best to address it straight away, or if it is not resolved satisfactorily, then people should come and tell us about it.""",The UK's biggest tour operator has been repeatedly fined for failing to stick to the travel industry's own code of conduct.
"Allegations of atrocities during the closing stages of that war have dogged the government ever since it ended. The rebels were also accused of abuses.
The government has strenuously denied such allegations and insist they are on the path of reconciliation and rebuilding Sri Lanka's north.
After independence from British rule, increasingly assertive Sinhala nationalists, resentful of what they saw as British favouritism towards minority Tamils, began to fan the flames of ethnic division.
A Tamil separatist movement gained momentum during the 1970s when a number of armed Tamil groups emerged in the north and parts of eastern Sri Lanka.
But in 1983 the insurgency was transformed after a brutal anti-Tamil backlash following the killing by insurgents of 13 soldiers spread throughout the country.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emerged under the leadership of Velupillai Prabhakaran as a ruthless and highly effective fighting force. It came to run what was in effect a shadow state in the north and east.
The group used suicide bombings and other attacks to devastating effect in the capital Colombo and elsewhere in the 1990s. It also killed high-profile figures, including Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
After various peace initiatives and ceasefires failed, the government launched a final offensive in 2009 and defeated the Tigers.
Until the final months of the war, the death toll for more than 25 years of conflict was estimated to be about 70,000.
But the final phase, when the government and rebels battled it out as thousands of civilians were hemmed in to a tiny strip of land on the north-eastern coast, has been the subject of most scrutiny.
Estimates range from 20,000-75,000 killed in the final assault, but a government estimate put the figure at about 9,000.
A 2011 UN report said hospitals, UN centres and ships belonging to the Red Cross were deliberately targeted by the army.
The government was accused of using heavy weaponry and UN images obtained by the BBC appeared to show shelling damage in a government-designated ""safe zone"" for civilians.
The report also accused the Tamil Tigers of using civilians as human shields, saying the rebels shot those who tried to escape. It also said that the rebels positioned heavy weapons in hospital grounds.
Sri Lanka rejected the claims in the report as biased and fraudulent.
Critics say there has been little serious attempt to do this so far.
The government appointed a Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission, which cleared the military of allegations that it had deliberately attacked civilians.
Rights groups dismissed the inquiry as ""flawed"".
In September 2013 the government held elections for a semi-autonomous council in the island's Tamil-majority north, a move which it said was a significant step in the reconciliation process.
The Tamil National Alliance (TNA) won 30 seats in the 38-member council and now forms the first functioning provincial government in the north.
The TNA's 80-year-old leader, Rajavarothiam Sampanthan, said the victory was a chance for everybody to ""think afresh about the future"".
The overwhelming majority of analysts agree that in the short term at least the answer is a resounding ""no"".
After so many years of war, many Sri Lankan Tamils are war-weary and struggling to earn a living.
But many also warn that the government runs the risk of alienating the minority if it does not act on political reconciliation.",Sri Lanka's army defeated separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in May 2009 after 26 years of civil war.

So who is going to lead the county's bid to win a fourth County Championship title?
Stokes' return to Durham for the start of the County Championship season might give fans a rare glimpse of his talents at the Riverside, after a winter away with England.
His last appearance for the national team came in agonising World Twenty20 final defeat by West Indies, in which he was hit for four consecutive sixes by Carlos Brathwaite in the final over, with them needing 19 to win.
County captain Paul Collingwood was with England as part of Trevor Bayliss' coaching team, and a familiar face at a tough time for all.
""Ben Stokes is the heartbeat of the England side, has plenty of friends in that dressing room but I know Stokesy really well,"" Collingwood told BBC Newcastle.
""When he goes through something as tough as that in such a big occasion he's obviously going to be upset.
""But he's the kind of character that bounces back straight away and he'll be desperate to get himself and his team into a situation like that again.
""Hopefully he'll have learned so much from those four balls he bowled in that over and make him stronger for the future.
""I'm sure he got a lot of people who put their arms around him and gave him a lot of advice and he'll be bouncing back in the future no doubt about that.""
Collingwood, even at 39 and his 20th year with Durham, was a key player in 2015, only missing one Championship game. Despite the ongoing speculation about his retirement is determined to play his part again in 2016.

""Every year for the last three I've gone into it saying it my last season, so this year I'm going to try to play as much as I can,"" he said.
""The body still feels pretty good, I'm still enjoying it, I've still got plenty of ambition to go out there and do well, so I want to play as long as I can.""
Few counties possess such devastating and experienced bowling attacks as Durham, with Graham Onions and Chris Rushworth leading the unit and cameos from England duo Mark Wood and Stokes.

Onions, 33, finished 2015 with 66 wickets while Rushworth, 29, was the Professional Cricketers Association player of the year with 90.
""I don't feel pressure, whether or not people say there is pressure,"" Rushworth said.
""We've got some big players here so I'm not feeling any pressure and will keep doing my job.""
The combination of the two local lads has been a backbone of the county in recent seasons, although last year might take some catching for both.
""That was a really good season, but it's very hard to put into words what Rushy did,"" Onions added.
""He'll look back on that and think it was an incredible season and to break the records was an amazing achievement.
""If he gets anywhere near that then he's had another awesome season but myself I don't look at wickets, I look at bowling overs and when the opposition are 200-1, getting the ball in my hand and trying to change the game.""
Jack Burnham's name has been mentioned in various quarters after a sparkling effort for England under-19s in their World Cup campaign earlier this year.

The 19-year-old hit three centuries, finishing with 420 runs and is hopeful of adding to his four Championship appearances in 2015.
""It's been very good, I've learned a lot and played a lot better than I thought I was going to do,"" Burnham said.
""It's been a pleasure to be out there for my country with the under-19s team, but it's good to be home back at Durham to crack on.
""For the lads to talk about me the way they do in such a positive manner, gives me a lot of belief to back my own skills and do what I can do.
""They give us a bit of stick but it's a good laugh, I grew up watching these players and now to be in the same changing room with them is an absolute pleasure.""","Without an overseas import for the 2016 season after John Hastings was called into the Australia player pool, Durham will again rely on largely home-grown talent."
"If true, it would solve one of aviation history's biggest mysteries.
Earhart vanished during a 1937 flight over the Pacific - and her disappearance has been a breeding ground for speculation ever since.
A photograph from the 1930s shows a figure that could be her, taken on the then-Japanese Marshall Islands.
However, at least one prominent expert has poured cold water on the claim, saying he was ""astounded"" it had taken off.
The new material - presented as evidence for an old theory - is a black-and-white photograph found in the vaults of the US National Archives.
It shows a group of people standing on a dock. The label on the photograph says it was taken on Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands, presumably by a US spy.
The link might seem thin, though, to the legendary pilot who five years before her disappearance had risen to fame as the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic.
The claim is that one seated person with her back to the camera could be Earhart, while another figure on the far left in the photo is said to be Fred Noonan, her navigator on that last flight.
On the very right of the picture is a blurry section which, it is claimed, shows Earhart's plane.
Ric Gillespie, author of Finding Amelia and executive director of The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), is certainly unconvinced.
He told the BBC: ""This photograph has people convinced. I'm astounded by this. I mean, my God! Look at this photograph... Let's use our heads for a moment. It's undated. They think it's from 1937. Okay. If it's from July 1, 1937 then it can't be Amelia, because she hadn't taken off yet.
""If it's from 1935 or 1938 it can't be her.... This photograph has to have been taken within a very narrow window - within a couple of days of when she disappeared.""
He notes that the photograph came from an Office of Naval Intelligence file, saying it was ""very natural"" the US would want a picture of this Japanese naval asset.
""And what does the photo say that it shows? ... Jaluit Atoll - Jaluit Island. It doesn't say 'Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody'!
""If this is a picture of Amelia Earhart in Japanese custody, where are the Japanese? There are no soldiers in this picture. Nobody in uniform,"" he observes.
The photograph was released by the US-based History channel ahead of a documentary to run this weekend. If the goal was to drum up attention - and hence audience numbers - it appears to have paid off.
A preview of the programme has two experts backing up the claim by looking at the torso measurements of the woman alleged to be Amelia Earhart in the photo, and teeth and hairline of the figure claimed to be Fred Noonan.
A far stretch? After all, the heroine has her back to the camera and it's debatable how much of a hairline let alone teeth can really be made out reliably on a faded photograph from the 1930s.
Mr Gillespie says it doesn't match other known pictures of the famous aviator.
""The person who they say is Amelia Earhart might be a white woman. But her hair is way too long to be Amelia's. We have many pictures of Earhart taken the day before she took off, and her hair's a lot shorter than that.""
He adds that the man identified as Fred Noonan does not, in his view, resemble the navigator. Further, his shirt is the wrong colour.
""The man is dressed in white. Noonan always wore dark shirts and dark slacks. Amelia didn't have a shirt like that with her on the trip either. So the Japanese have apparently given them new clothes.
""Everything about this is wrong,"" he concludes. ""I'm astounded.""
Scepticism aside, the alleged scoop feeds into one of the existing theories about what happened to Earhart and her navigator.
She disappeared during her attempt to fly around the globe, trying to reach Howland Island in the Pacific for refuelling.
The official explanation is that she didn't find the island, lost communication and ran out of fuel, only to crash into the ocean.
While that's a largely accepted version of events, there is no evidence - as in debris - to back it up.
The two other prominent theories are that Earhart crash-landed on or near the then-Japanese Marshall Islands, or that she made it to Nikumaroro island near Kiribati and died a castaway there.
There is no conclusive evidence for either of these theories - but that hasn't stopped amateur and professional historians from digging into them.
Parts of a skeleton found on Nikumaroro in 1940 were initially thought to have been hers, but doctors at the time decided they belonged to a male body.
Mr Gillespie, who backs the Nikumaroro theory, has led 11 expeditions in the South Pacific to research Earhart's fate. He points out that the island was uninhabited at the time when Earhart would have landed there.
He and his team have recovered artefacts which they say strongly suggest the presence of an American woman from the right era - including a makeup box from the 1930s, a popular US women's moisturiser, and a jacket zipper.
Mr Gillespie also cites the timing and location of radio distress calls sent by Earhart after her plane came down. He says the calls were sent ""night after night"" - which would suggest the plane was on land, not in the water - because if the radios got wet, they wouldn't work.
""After six nights the radio signals stopped,"" he told the BBC. ""We now think that's because the airplane was landed on the reef round the island, which is flat, smooth - dries at low tide... But the tide does come in and go out, and ... by the sixth night [he believes] the aeroplane was washed into the ocean by the tides.
""So when the planes from the battleship flew over the island a week later, no plane was visible.""
The rest of the search took place in open ocean, and found nothing. The would-be rescuers concluded that Earhart and Noonan had sunk without a trace.
The conclusion drawn by the History documentary, based on the new Marshall Islands picture, is that Earhart was taken by the Japanese, later interned and eventually died a prisoner of war.
The Marshall Islands went from German to Japanese hands during World War One, and ahead of the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor became an important military post for Tokyo.
The Japanese archives have no records of Earhart as a prisoner - but with many documents from these archives known to have been lost, this does not necessarily prove the story wrong.
At the same time, the discovery of a single photograph that may or may not show the two lost pilots is likely to add to the mystery rather than solve it.",A newly-discovered photo suggests legendary US pilot Amelia Earhart might have died in Japanese custody - and not in a plane crash in the Pacific.

"Investigators believe the fire in Nauen, west of Berlin, was started deliberately. No-one was injured.
Far-right protesters have demonstrated against asylum seekers in the area.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier condemned violent protests at an asylum shelter in the eastern town of Heidenau, near Dresden, at the weekend.
Dozens of police officers were injured in the clashes.
Mrs Merkel has described the behaviour of far-right activists in Heidenau as ""abhorrent"" and ""shameful"" and said she would be visiting the town on Wednesday.
Correspondents say most Germans have been welcoming to asylum seekers, but a small minority has been vocal in its opposition.
Also on Tuesday, the headquarters of the Social Democrat Party (SPD) in Berlin were evacuated after a bomb threat.
It is not clear who was behind the threat and a search of the building found nothing suspicious.
Officials in the party say it has received many threats from right-wing extremists after party chairman and Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel visited Heidenau on Monday.
Germany expects up to 800,000 people to seek asylum by the end of 2015.
The government confirmed on Tuesday that it had decided to consider asylum cases from the majority of Syrian applicants, regardless of how they entered Europe.
It announced on Twitter (in German) that it was suspending the EU's Dublin regulation, under which asylum seekers must make their applications in the first member state they reach.
The blaze in Nauen gutted the gymnasium - part of a vocational school - in the early hours of Tuesday.
The building, about 15km (nine miles) west of Berlin, was due to house about 130 people applying for asylum in Germany, reports say.
Dietmar Woidke, state premier for Brandenburg where Nauen is located, said actions against asylum seekers were ""shameful and unworthy of Germany"".
Another planned shelter was burned down in the south-western town of Weissach im Tal on Monday. Police are again investigating the possibility it could have been started deliberately.
""Refugees welcome!"" exclaims the front page of the Bild newspaper this morning.
It speaks for the majority of Germans who are horrified by yet another attack on accommodation intended for asylum seekers.
The number of such attacks has risen sharply this year, although they are still relatively low at around 200.
Following violent demonstrations outside a shelter in the eastern town of Heidenau over the weekend, many here are at pains to emphasise that a small minority are responsible.
Across the political spectrum MPs and ministers have condemned xenophobia.
But, in a country still painfully conscious of its World War Two history, there is shame too. In the words of Norbert Lammert, the president of the Bundestag, the violence is ""an embarrassment for our country"".

Didcot said it was ""very disappointed"", while Hereford - leading 2-1 at the time of the abandonment - said it was ""deeply concerned"".
BBC commentator Bill Rennells said ""fists were flying everywhere"".
A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: ""A 19-year-old man from Hereford was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence, and a 19-year-old man from Hereford was arrested on suspicion of common assault.""
Both men have been bailed until April.
About 800 people attended Saturday's match, with the majority supporting the visiting Hereford team.
Didcot manager Andy Ballard called it a ""very bizarre day"".
He added: ""I do have to commend the referee, he made a fantastic decision to call the game off.

"Les Price, from Abertillery, Blaenau Gwent, has been told he is not ill enough for weight-loss surgery.
To qualify on the NHS, a person must have a body mass index of more than 35 and a serious health condition which could be improved if they lost weight.
Mr Price, 45, said he cannot complete simple tasks without help.
""It's hard,"" he told BBC Radio Wales.
""When I have a shower I need my partner to help me wash... and if I need creams put on, then drying and dressing.""
Mr Price began to put on weight after losing his wife less than a year after they married.
""It sort of knocked me for six, I didn't want to do nothing,"" he said.
""It was just takeaways for a good six months. It really hit me hard, so I did overindulge a lot then.""
Mr Price also had an accident at work which left him temporarily immobile and unable to exercise, which also caused weight gain.
He told BBC's Jason Mohammad programme his weight attracts attention when he goes out.
""Mentally every time you go out, it's like you're looking at people to see how they are reacting to seeing you.
""Little kids say it how it is, 'oh mam, look at that fat man'.""
In a bid to get help, Mr Price met Dr Nadim Haboubi, who runs the only NHS-funded weight management clinic in Wales.
He was initially told he was a ""prime example"" for a gastric band, but because he does not suffer from a chronic illness which would be improved by weight loss, such as heart disease or diabetes, he does not qualify for the surgery.
""Every time I'm put forward I'm told 'sorry, you're not ill enough',"" he said.

"The minister and farming representatives met Liz Truss, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in London.
""I was adamant that action is needed now and that the intervention price must be raised,"" said Mrs O'Neill.
Farmers have warned they will go out of business if they do not receive higher prices for milk.
They have held protests at supermarkets to show their frustration that they are currently paid less than the cost of production.
Mrs O'Neill added: ""I and farming industry representatives from Northern Ireland were also adamant that pursuing opportunities in opening new markets tomorrow will not address the crisis our farmers are facing today.""
The minister and the representatives were joined at the meeting by their counterparts from Scotland, Wales and the UK's farming unions.
The meeting was called to address a number of issues facing the farming industry, especially the dairy sector.
""It is clear that European support for our farmers is vital right now,"" said Mrs O'Neill.
""The dairy sector in Northern Ireland, which is heavily reliant on exports, has been hit hard by adverse exchange rates and poor market conditions.
""Farm gate milk prices are now below the cost of production. Assistance is required. Our circumstances are unique and extreme.
""While it is good that my counterparts in Wales and Scotland are committed to influencing Liz Truss to act speedily, I am clear that raising the intervention price threshold is the key lever to effect positive change in the short term.""
The minister intends to ask the EU Commissioner Phil Hogan to raise the intervention threshold price when she meets him in September.
She will also attend the specially-convened Agriculture Council in Brussels on 7 September.
Environment Secretary Ms Truss said: ""I recognise the seriousness of the current situation for the dairy industry and for farming as a whole.
""Our hard working farmers and the Â£100bn food and farming industry are vital for our economy and our countryside.
""I want to see this situation taken seriously by the EU who have the means to help farmers manage this volatility and build resilience.""
Earlier, Mrs O'Neill said: ""The Northern Ireland dairy farming industry is probably in the worst condition it has ever been.""
Ulster Farmers Union president Ian Marshall also attended the meeting.
He said a united front would help influence the European Commissioner Paul Hogan in attempts to get Brussels to intervene and support the price of milk
""When the unions went out and spoke to Phil Hogan a number of months ago, certainly Northern Ireland was a lone voice,"" he said.
""The landscape has changed now in that other member states are certainly applying pressure to the commissioner and we have no doubt that he's coming under immense pressure to revisit the discussion on intervention.""",Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill has urged the European Union to act swiftly to support farmers.

"The company wants to extract shale gas at Little Plumpton and Roseacre Wood on the Fylde Coast.
In June, the council rejected both planning applications, after fracking was suspended in the UK in 2011.
The company said ""a natural step"" would now be to appeal.
Cuadrilla said the council's planning officer ""had recommended approval of the Preston New Road site"" at Little Plumpton ""and was very clear that the proposals were acceptable in relation to noise and visual impacts."".
Its chief executive, Francis Egan, said: ""We have given careful consideration to appeal the planning decisions taken by Lancashire County Council. This is a natural step in the democratic process for deciding any planning application.""
He added: ""We recognise that onshore shale gas exploration still feels relatively new in the UK and we remain committed to engaging with local communities to reassure them that exploratory operations can and will be carried out safely and in an environmentally responsible way.""
The company was granted planning permission for monitoring works around the proposed site at Roseacre Wood, but said it would appeal against certain conditions that were imposed.
The appeals on monitoring works are expected to be submitted within the next week, and the shale gas exploration site appeals will ""follow in due course,"" the company said.
Fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - was suspended in the UK in 2011 following earth tremors in Blackpool where Cuadrilla previously drilled.
It is a technique in which water and chemicals are pumped into shale rock at high pressure to extract gas.
Friends of the Earth campaigner Furqan Naeem said: ""Cuadrilla's decision to appeal Lancashire's Council's resounding 'no' to controversial fracking shows a blatant disregard for the views of local people and local democracy.
""Lancashire councillors and residents have rejected fracking and the government's recent report revealing potential negative impacts on everything from the health of residents, to house prices, to climate change shows they were right to do so.""

"Seau, a 1990s star with the San Diego Chargers, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on Wednesday, after his girlfriend found him unconscious.
His death followed the 2011 suicide of former Chicago Bears star Dave Duerson.
Their deaths have led to questions over the effect of concussions on the brains of professional football players.
""They [the family] believe that through allowing this procedure, it will allow the betterment of other individuals and athletes in the years ahead,"" Pastor Shawn Mitchell, former chaplain for the Chargers, told the Reuters news agency.
""Their thought is, if it can benefit others, then it's probably worth going forward with.""
The San Diego County Medical Examiner's Office said Seau's brain would need to be conducted by outside researchers.
Seau's family has not said whether they believe concussions could have played a role in the football star's death.
But recent studies have found a connection between repeated concussions and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a disease with symptoms including memory loss and mood swings.
On Thursday, a more than a hundred former National Football League players filed a lawsuit claiming the National Football League (NFL) deliberately hid the dangers of concussions from them.
They join an additional 1,500 former NFL players who have put their names to similar lawsuits.
Duerson's family have already filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the NFL, alleging that the organisation did not do enough to prevent or treat concussions that had damaged his brain. He died in February 2011.
Seau's ex-wife, Gina, told the Associated Press news agency that over the course of his 20-year football career, Seau also suffered concussions.
But his relatives and friends say they did not know of any issues that may have led to his death. Police have said they did not find a suicide note.
In 2010, Seau drove his car off a cliff hours after he had been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence.
Seau starred with his hometown San Diego Chargers for 13 years before playing with the Miami Dolphins and New England Patriots.
He was inducted into the Chargers Hall of Fame in 2010.",The family of former American football star Junior Seau has donated his brain for research into the effects of head trauma on football players.

Her preserved remains were found in 2006 at a mud-brick ruined pyramid known Huaca Cao Viejo, near Trujillo.
Scientists were able to replicate her face after analysing her skull structure and remains.
The Lady of Cao was buried with a crown, and gold and copper items.
The grave also contained a number of weapons, including two massive war clubs and 23 spear throwers.
A modern autopsy revealed she had been in her 20s when she died, probably of childbirth or pregnancy complications.
Her feet, legs and face were tattooed with magic symbols of serpents and spiders.
The richness of her burial site suggests she might have been a priestess or even a political ruler.

On hearing the museum had been successful in raising funds to purchase the ring, Ms Clarkson said: ""The ring is a beautiful national treasure and I am happy to know that so many Jane Austen fans will get to see it at Jane Austen's House Museum.""
The museum said it hoped to welcome Ms Clarkson there in the future.

"The NASUWT survey claims some parents are asked for £400 or more per year.
Schools in England have been warning of cash shortages and the union says schools are now depending on parents.
But the Department for Education says ""no parent is required to make a contribution"".
Teachers' unions are holding their conferences over the Easter bank holiday weekend, with funding one of the biggest issues.
The National Union of Teachers, meeting in Cardiff, will hear warnings on Saturday about the impact of cash shortages.
The survey from the NASUWT survey, holding its annual conference in Manchester, claims that schools are increasingly relying on money from parents.
Based on almost 4,000 responses, the survey says 18% of parents have been asked to sign up for direct debits or standing orders for their children's school, typically of about £50 per year.
But more than one in 20 parents with children in state schools were paying £400 or above.
A further 13% of parents had been asked to make donations in cash or cheques.
Your comments on schools asking parents to top up their budgets:
""She's only been there a term, but there seems to be a letter home at least once a week asking for money,"" a parent told the NASUWT survey.
""The school asks for a 'voluntary contribution' but if you forget to pay you are sent texts telling you that you haven't paid,"" said another parent.
There were other financial costs for parents, such as a laptop for homework and music lessons.
""We have not allowed them to do music at school as they need to provide their own instruments,"" said a parent, quoted in the survey.
Over a quarter of parents said their child had been unable to take part in a trip or excursion because of the cost.
""Ski trip was £600. French trip £450. These are for less than a week. They are beyond my funds,"" a parent told the survey.
The union's leader Chris Keates said that ""access to education must not be based on parents' ability to pay"".
This week the Sutton Trust education charity warned of schools cutting staff because of financial pressure.
The Public Accounts Committee has said that standards are threatened by school budget cuts of £3bn.
A lobby of Parliament over funding, by teachers' unions and parents' campaign groups, has been announced for early June.
Kevin Courtney, NUT general secretary, reminded the government of a manifesto commitment to parents that ""the money that follows their children into schools will be protected"".
""In half of the schools in the country the money following your child into schools has been dramatically cut in cash terms, and in the other half it's been cut in real terms,"" he said.
A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""No parent is required to make a contribution to their child's education, the rules are clear on this and no policies have been introduced by this government to allow schools to charge parents.""
The spokeswoman said school funding was at record levels, but ""we recognise schools are facing cost pressures.""","Almost one in five parents in the UK is being asked to set up payments to their children's schools, as head teachers warn of budget shortages, says a survey from a teachers' union."
"Up to 6,500 homes in the Castlemilk and Croftfoot areas of Glasgow and some parts of Rutherglen in South Lanarkshire had been affected.
Some properties lost all water supply, while others experienced low pressure or discoloured water.
A water main in Castlemilk Drive burst at about 07:00 on Saturday.
Scottish Water said engineers were still working on the repair but had been able to restore normal water supplies to the ""vast majority"" of affected properties.
Homes still without water are likely to be on higher parts of the network.
The company said in a statement: ""When normal supplies are restored, affected customers might experience discoloured water as the system recharges.
""If so, customers are advised to run the cold water tap in their kitchen gently until the water starts to run clear.
""Scottish Water apologises to all affected customers for the inconvenience and thanks them for their patience and understanding.""
The road where the burst occurred remains closed to allow engineers to work on the pipe.","Water has been restored to most of the homes which lost their supply after a mains pipe burst, Scottish Water has said."
"For the past decade or so, I have been writing stories about the return of trains to the Borders but, of course, the struggle started long before that.
Indeed, you could argue that the battle really began back in 1969 - or even earlier - when the Waverley line through the region was closed.
On the night when the final train set off from Edinburgh there was a demonstration in Galashiels station.
There were also protests at Melrose and Hawick.
Despite the opposition, the sound of a train pulling up at a station would be absent from the Scottish Borders for the next four decades and more.
There were regular rumbles of discontent in between times and they started to take more solid form at the end of the 20th century.
In 1999, the Campaign for Borders Rail was formally launched at a Burns Supper in Melrose Station.
It subsequently gathered thousands of signatures on a petition pressing for a route to the region to be reopened.
And, in 2000, an independent study concluded that the reopening of the Borders rail link could be financially viable.
The gears of progress were slowly clicking into motion and, five years later, a Holyrood committee supported the case for reopening the line.
Then, in 2006, the bill was approved which would pave the way for work to finally begin.
At that time a Â£155m price tag was attached to the project with a forecast opening in 2011.
However, there were soon problems in meeting both that deadline and budget and it emerged that both would be missed.
By 2008, the estimated costs had risen to between Â£235m and Â£295m and the opening date was pushed back two years.
Work officially started in 2010 but there were still a few twists and turns in store.
Three groups were selected to submit tenders for the work but as companies dropped out of the process that plan had to be scrapped.
Instead, the Scottish government decided that Network Rail could take the project forward.
Despite these apparent setbacks, the major clearance and constructions works continued along the length of the line from Tweedbank to Edinburgh.
All along the route, there were now clear indications that transport between the capital and the Borders was being transformed as stations, bridges and new road layouts slotted into place.
And, although the completion deadline was once again put back to 2015, the reality of the scale of the scheme was really starting to sink in.
Then, last year, a symbolic moment was reached as the track laying began.
As machines slowly rolled along the route, it became clear that the decision which had so incensed many people nearly half a century ago would finally be reversed.
Some have said it does not go far enough and would like to see the line extended back to Carlisle where it used to reach.
Others have concerns about turning south east Scotland into a commuter belt for Edinburgh or question how much effect it will have in more remote parts of the Borders.
But what cannot be doubted is what a historic moment it is for this part of the country.
A region which has gone without railway stations for so long will now have no fewer than three.
One long journey which started in the late 1960s has been completed and now many more - lasting an hour at most - can be undertaken.",It has been a long journey and not always a straightforward one.

Cunningham was seen as a possible replacement for Joe Bennett, who has been in talks with Fulham after they triggered his release clause.

Republic of Ireland international Cunningham has made more than 50 appearances for Preston.

""There is a clause in his contract ... and if they trigger that clause there's not a lot I can do,"" he said.

Ainslie, 35, admits it would have been ""difficult to top"" the feeling of winning at his home Olympics and is keen to move on with new challenges.
""It was a tough decision,"" Ainslie told BBC Sport.
""I've had a fantastic Olympic career but I want to make it clear that the focus is now on the Americas Cup.""
Ainslie won a silver medal at Atlanta 1996, with golds in Sydney, Athens, Beijing and London. He has won more medals than any other sailor, ahead of Denmark's Paul Elvstrom, who has four golds.
He is fourth in Britain's all-time individual medallist's list, behind Sir Chris Hoy (cycling; six gold, one silver), Sir Steve Redgrave (rowing; five gold, one bronze) and Bradley Wiggins (cycling; four gold, one silver, two bronze).
Media playback is not supported on this device
Ainslie added: ""I considered all of the factors - my fitness and the issues with my back, the venue for the next Olympics and the type of boats, but what it really came down to was this opportunity with the Americas Cup.""
The sailor envisages skippering his Ben Ainslie Racing AC45 catamaran to glory in the historic competition will be one of the ""biggest tests"" of his career.
""It's always been a dream of mine since I was a kid to be part of a winning Americas Cup team and ultimately I want to try and bring it back to the UK where it all started in 1851.""
Ainslie, who won his first Games medal - a silver in the Laser fleet - at Atlanta 1996, says he may have extended his Olympic career into a twentieth year had the International Sailing Federation [ISAF] reversed their decision to axe the Star class from Rio 2016.
""There was a possibility that it may have been reinstated, but that didn't happen,"" reflected the four-time World Sailor of the Year Award winner.
""There would have been no guarantees I would have made it to the Olympics going up against 2008 gold medallists Iain [Percy] and Andrew [Simpson], but certainly it was an option to go into that class.""
Ainslie ranked his success in London as his greatest personal Olympic moment, but that attaining a first gold at the Sydney 2000 Games was a close second.
""It meant a huge amount to me to reverse the silver medal from 1996 and it gave me a huge amount of confidence that I could go on and achieve more,"" stated Ainslie who switched from the Laser to the Finn dinghy for Athens 2004.
""I am proud of what I achieved [in the Olympics] but I think this decision [to retire from dinghy sailing] really helps to make it clear what the goal is and the intensions are.
""Hopefully now we can go ahead and get the support to make that [Americas Cup success] happen.""",British sailor Ben Ainslie will not bid for a fifth Olympic gold medal at the 2016 Rio Games and will instead focus on his Americas Cup campaign.
"Vicki McNelly, 29, thought she heard the baby moving when she used the Doppler kit but her daughter was stillborn the following day.
Manufacturers say the kits are safe and should not be linked to stillbirths.
Experts who have been ""specially trained"" regularly use the monitors but discourage the use of them at home.
Mrs McNelly, from Mortimer near Reading, is calling for the Doppler devices to be banned.
She had used the kit - which can be bought over-the-counter from about Â£25 - in June 2015 to help her husband bond with their baby.
However, after waking and ""feeling something was wrong"" in the middle of the night, she used it to check for a heartbeat and movement.
""Because I heard something, I convinced myself I must be okay and that everything would be fine,"" she said.
""If the Doppler wasn't in the house I would have only been able to rely on my own instincts. I think the Doppler gave me a false sense of security.""
Mrs McNelly said a hospital sonogram revealed her child, who she had named Evie, had died in the womb.
Dr Alison Wright, Vice President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said she ""strongly discourages"" the use of Dopplers at home.
""These devices can cause huge anxiety among pregnant women if they are not able to hear their baby's heartbeat and therefore understandably worry until they can see their doctor or midwife,"" she said.
""Also, potentially, women may be falsely reassured as hearing a heartbeat is not necessarily an indication that it is well with the baby.
""Unlike doctors and midwives who are specially trained to use foetal heart monitors, women who use Dopplers themselves may easily mistake their own heartbeat for their baby's.""
Mrs McNelly has now joined stillbirth charity Kicks Count to call for the devices to be banned - with a petition reaching more than 11,000 signatures.
CEO of Kicks Count, Elizabeth Hudson, said Dopplers ""create a barrier between the mum and seeking medical help"".
She said many brands were marketed to expectant mothers, but should only be used by trained professionals such as midwives and doctors.
""Women are using Dopplers and being reassured by them, and unfortunately that leads to missed opportunities to save babies who may be in distress,"" Ms Hudson added.
The BBC contacted several Doppler manufacturers, which said their devices should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care.","A grieving mother has warned pregnant women not to use a home foetal listening device that gave her ""false reassurance"" her unborn baby was alive."
"Gbagbo, 65, had been charged with undermining state security.
Her husband, former Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo, is awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court (ICC).
More than 3,000 people died in the violence that followed the presidential poll after the ex-leader refused to accept defeat to Alassane Ouattara.
She and her husband were arrested in 2011 after troops stormed a bunker where the pair had taken refuge in the main city, Abidjan.
And it was in the same city where Gbagbo - once called the ""Iron Lady"" and known for her fiery speeches - faced trial. She was also accused of disturbing public order and organising armed gangs.
She denied witness accounts that accused her of personally distributing arms to the death squads that operated in Abidjan during the five-month conflict.
The court unanimously sentenced her to 20 years, which is the sentence for undermining state security.
The prosecution had only asked for 10 years - but this had only been for the charge of disturbing public order.
The BBC's Ali Bamba in Abidjan says the verdict was delivered in the early hours of Tuesday morning after eight hours of deliberation by the jury.
The former first lady remained calm, as she had been throughout the trial, almost as if she knew what was coming, he says.
Her daughter from a previous marriage, Marie Antoinette Singleton, told the BBC's Newsday programme that the sentence was unfair and a sign of ""political justice"".
""Why would you want to double it? It's not about justice; it's about getting rid of political adversaries.
""If we say that something wrong happened, it happened on both sides. Nobody looked into bringing all responsible parties to trial,"" she said.
Simone Gbagbo's lawyer said they would appeal.
""I was expecting Simone to be acquitted,"" Rodrigue Dadje told the BBC French service.
""There is no proof of her involvement at a personal levelâ€¦ I am ashamed for the Ivorian justice system.""
The former first lady was on trial with 82 other supporters of her husband  - 15 of whom were acquitted.
Two former military allies also received 20-year jail terms: Gen Bruno Dogbo Ble, once head of the Republic Guard, and the ex-navy chief Adm Vagba Faussignaux.
The other accused got lesser sentences.
Before her sentencing, Simone Gbagbo had said that she forgave the prosecution, despite the humiliation she had suffered during the trial.
""I forgive because, if we don't forgive, this country will burn,"" she said.
Both sides were accused of atrocities in the conflict that followed the 2010 poll.
But our correspondent says despite a promise from President Alassane Ouattara that both sides would face justice, no-one in the president's camp has been charged.
Laurent Gbagbo, is facing four charges at the ICC in The Hague, including murder, rape and persecution.
The ICC had issued an arrest warrant for Simone Gbagbo too, but this was dismissed by the Ivorian government.","Ivory Coast's former first lady, Simone Gbagbo, has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for her role in the violence that followed the 2010 elections."

"Kurdish elements of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) would be equipped to help drive IS from its stronghold, Raqqa, a spokeswoman said.
The US was ""keenly aware"" of Turkey's concerns about such a move, she added.
Turkey views the Kurdish rebels as terrorists and wants to stop them taking more territory in Syria.
The Pentagon later said US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis had spoken by phone to his Turkish counterpart, Fikri Isik, but gave no details of the conversation. Turkish officials have not yet responded publicly.
SDF forces, which comprise Kurdish and Arab militias, are already being supported by elite US forces and air strikes from a US-led coalition.
The US has previously supplied light weapons and armoured vehicles to the Arab element of the SDF, known as the Syrian Arab Coalition.
The SDF is currently battling IS for control of the city of Tabqa, an IS command centre just 50km (30 miles) from Raqqa.
The Kurdish fighters are from the Kurdish Peoples' Protection Units (YPG), which Turkey sees as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a group it has been fighting for decades.
Last month, Turkey carried out air strikes on YPG positions in Syria which it described as ""terrorist havens"".
The US believes the Kurdish fighters will be essential to Raqqa's downfall.
The Pentagon sees them as the most disciplined and organised of the anti-IS groups but Turkish opposition has meant Washington has had to tread a fine line.
The imminence of the fight for the city means delay is no longer an option and the Kurds will be getting a range of equipment.
US sources say they have received assurances from the Kurds that they will leave Raqqa to be governed by Syrian Arabs after the battle.
Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is due in Washington next week - he will not be a happy visitor.
A Pentagon source told the BBC the equipment would include ammunition, small arms, machine guns, heavy machine guns, construction equipment such as bulldozers and armoured vehicles.
The source added that the US would ""seek to recover"" the equipment afterwards.
No timeline has been given for when the weapons would start to be supplied.
""We are keenly aware of the security concerns of our coalition partner Turkey,"" said Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White, who is travelling with Mr Mattis in Lithuania.
""We want to reassure the people and government of Turkey that the US is committed to preventing additional security risks and protecting our Nato ally.""","US President Donald Trump has approved supplying weapons to Kurdish forces fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria, the Pentagon says."

The expansion project, known as the Pinewood Studios Development Framework (PSDF), will double the existing studios by adding a total of 100,000 square metres of new facilities, including 12 large stages, workshops and production offices.
A studio spokesman said the expansion would ""secure future growth"".
The studio said the decision by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Eric Pickles, ""will address the clear need for additional capacity in the UK"".
Pinewood chief executive Ivan Dunleavy said: ""We want to begin construction as soon as possible.""
In 2012, the government rejected a previous plan, which included more than 1,000 homes.
The studio submitted its latest application in February 2013, following ""extensive public consultation"".
It was rejected by the local council and the studios submitted its appeal to the Planning Inspectorate the following May.

"The NCS aims to prepare teenagers for work through team building activities and community projects.
It has run in England since 2011 and a pilot scheme began in Wales in 2014.
Mr Cameron, visiting Snowdonia, said it was a ""fantastic opportunity"" for young people.
The intention is that graduates on the scheme, called Teach First, lead teenagers on group activities and challenges like mountaineering, canoeing and abseiling.
More than 1,700 graduates joined Teach First in England and Wales this year, and the intention is for all to be involved in the volunteer scheme by 2017.
Visiting an outdoor education centre in the Conwy valley on Friday, Mr Cameron said: ""NCS is a fantastic opportunity for young people from different backgrounds to come together to gain life skills and give something back to their local community.
""Teach First's mission to break down social barriers makes its teachers ideal volunteer mentors to engage with and inspire young people on NCS.
""This fantastic partnership will create thousands more opportunities for young people to benefit from NCS.""
The NCS is a key part of Mr Cameron's ""Big Society"" agenda, encouraging the growth of volunteering and promoting so-called social enterprises.

"There are many things about it that have attracted comment from US columnists to the blogosphere: that he oversaw such controversial and costly wars but should ultimately fall on a matter of personal behaviour; that President Barack Obama was not apparently informed until election day that Gen Petraeus was under investigation by the FBI; and that the issue is now drawing in more people, including General John Allen, who replaced Gen Petraeus as the commander of Nato forces in Afghanistan.
The inquiry resulted from complaints by a woman that she had received threatening e-mails from Paula Broadwell, Gen Petraeus' biographer and for several months apparently also his lover.

Having met and interviewed him several times, I can certainly confirm that he took particular care of his image (for example preferring to be filmed favouring the patch on his right shoulder - the combat one of the 101st Airborne Division, which he commanded during the 2003 invasion of Iraq), and that lately his staff tried hard to discourage challenging lines of questioning, whereas during our earlier meetings he had proven more than happy to tackle whatever we threw at him.
It was during one of these later meetings with Gen Petraeus that he introduced me to Mrs Broadwell, who at that time was working on her book about him and with whom, it emerged last week, he was having an affair.
I will not pretend that I had any great presentiment or intuition about what was going on, but did note that during our off-camera conversations, he and I reflected in a humorous way on the ageing process and how it played out in men.
Gen Petraeus had gone through cancer treatment in 2009 and it is in this context that a friend of his, a fellow general, sought to explain to me today what had happened:
""Almost everyone considered him to be immortal, but he had been shaken by the cancer business and continually deployed for five-and-a-half years.""
The same officer concluded that while his friend was right to offer his resignation once the extramarital affair with Ms Broadwell had come to light, that ""the president shouldn't have accepted it"".
Some reports today suggest that the CIA director did not even himself feel it was a resigning matter, but was persuaded to write the letter by the Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper.
The head of the wider US intelligence community apparently felt it would not be possible for Gen Petraeus to discipline CIA staff accused of marital indiscretions, if he had shown himself fallible in the same regard.
General Stan McChrystal, Gen Petraeus' predecessor as Nato commander in Kabul, also suffered a public fall from grace in 2010, stepping down after staff members were quoted by Rolling Stone magazine being critical about the Obama administration.
Some used a similar formula at the time, about the president not needing to accept a tendered resignation.
Both generals had been lionised in the US press and in Congress, particularly for reversing the slide to civil war in Iraq.
It is also true to say that many of the commanders, including British as well as American, whom I have spoken to in Iraq and Afghanistan were completely in awe of these two men and their abilities.
As for what they achieved in their attempt to replicate the success of the Iraq surge in Afghanistan, that is a different matter, for many now consider it to have failed.
That two commanders who wielded power of life and death over so many, and were widely praised as soldier-scholars, should fall on issues of PR and an affair is itself a stark measure of the degree to which personal failings that might once have been kept private can now be the decisive factors in professional ruin.
And how serious are the charges that led to their fall? The FBI cleared the CIA boss of any involvement with sending threatening emails, even if he still has serious issues to address with his wife Holly Petraeus.
And an inquiry into Gen McChrystal's conduct towards the Rolling Stone reporter exonerated him of any misconduct.
Some once talked of Gen Petraeus - his physical fitness, charging intellect, and devotion to duty in almost super-human terms. Ultimately though he has proven himself all too fallible.","The fall of David Petraeus, director of the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the general who successfully commanded America's troop surge in Iraq during 2007-8 is a modern morality tale, even if it did arise from one of the most ancient human failings, marital infidelity."
"Ministers say it is necessary so police and security services can access the data they need after a legal ruling which declared existing powers invalid.
The proposed law has the backing of Labour and the coalition parties.
A special cabinet is being held to agree the planned laws, which will only last until 2016.
Prime Minister David Cameron and his Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will tell a special cabinet meeting on Thursday that emergency legislation is necessary to keep the country safe.
A recent ruling of the European Court of Justice has removed the obligation on telecoms companies to retain records of when and who their customers have called, texted and emailed.
Without a new law Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg will claim that that information could be destroyed within weeks by companies fearing legal challenges.
Labour is backing emergency legislation after all-party talks agreed that this law would enshrine existing rights and not be used to extend them by re-introducing the so-called ""snoopers charter"".
It will also bring in so-called safeguards including:
Critics will no doubt argue that the time for that debate is now. To pass any new law in just a week is rare. So too is it to have the backing of all three main parties even before it is published.
On a subject as sensitive as giving the police and security services access to phone and internet data this is bound to be controversial.
Update 08:45 BST: The emergency legislation will oblige telecom firms to retain data for 12 months. Under the European law which it replaces companies could be asked to retain data for 24 months.
More controversially the new law will also produce what is being described as a ""clearer legal framework"" to allow access to the content of calls, texts and emails after a warrant is signed by a senior government minister. Telecoms companies are said to have warned ministers that after the Edward Snowden revelations they are vulnerable to legal challenge by their customers.
The Labour MP Tom Watson has condemned the plans as a ""stitch up"" which prevent MPs from considering the legislation properly.","Emergency legislation will be brought in next week to force phone and internet companies to log records of customer calls, texts and internet use."
"An extraordinary congress in Freetown on Thursday ended with Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) president Isha Johansen and her biggest critics embracing and shaking hands to pave the way for a fresh beginning for football in the country.
One of the major reasons for the tension between aggrieved stakeholders and the SLFA executive committee was the setting up of an appropriate body to investigate match-fixing allegations.
It's a good day. Football is bigger than us. What I want is a genuine and lasting peace
This has now been resolved with the formation of an ethics body - a first for Sierra Leone football.
It will be one of the association's judicial bodies and will investigate four Sierra Leone internationals, referees and administrators accused of match-fixing by the SLFA.
The convening of the first congress under the current SLFA administration came about after Sierra Leone's president Ernest Bai Koroma gave the SLFA an ultimatum to solve their internal dispute on or before March 31, 2017.
It was also in line with a peace road map set out by Fifa secretary general Fatma Samoura (pictured below) when she visited Freetown last November.
""I'm extremely happy. It's the start of a good working relationship between us and the stakeholders,"" said Johansen.
""It's a good day. Football is bigger than us. What I want is a genuine and lasting peace.""
The extraordinary general assembly also paved the way for nine out of 14 Premier League teams to put an end to a breakaway league to participate in the country's top tier league which will commence soon.
At the end of the congress Johansen said: ""I'm pleased to announce that we are ready to play football everywhere in Sierra Leone at all levels.""
She also stated that the SLFA would provide almost $29,000 for the commencement of the Premier League and it would also provide financial supports to other domestic competitions including the female national league.
Leader of the stakeholders, Idrissa Tarawalley, who doubles as secretary general of a Premier League club Ports Authority FC, is delighted about the truce and the decision for the Premier league to start soon.
""We are happy that there is now peace as a result of a successful extraordinary congress. This is what we've been yearning for. We only hope that it'll be a sincere and lasting peace,"" said Tarawalley.
""We look forward to further discussions with the FA on how to move things forward.
""I'm also delighted that the beneficiaries - the footballers - will now have a chance to ply their trade as we have agreed that the Premier League will start soon.
""For far too long we've deprived our footballers from playing. We can no longer afford to deprive them"" Tarawalley added.
The Sierra Leone Sports minister Ahmed Khanou, who co-chaired the congress as moral guarantor of the peace process, is also buoyed by the mood of optimism.
""I'm happy about the outcome of the congress and be assured that I'm committed to getting lasting peace, "" said Khanou.
""The consultations will continue and I'm happy everybody is now on board to play football everywhere in the country.""",Sierra Leone football looks set for a new start after years of problems and infighting within its governing body.

"NHS England is spending £40m on doctors and other specialist mental health workers as part of its drive to help 30,000 more women by 2021.
At present, more than half of the country provides only basic services.
One in five women experiences severe depression or in some cases psychosis around the time of childbirth.
The funding will pay for more nurses and psychiatrists to provide specialist care for women in their homes and in maternity units, by giving advice on medication and lifestyle, counselling them and helping to minimise the risks to mother and baby if they become ill.
The money will also go towards providing buddying and telephone support from mothers who have had similar issues.
Some of the 20 areas to receive a share of the £40m include Bristol, Birmingham and Northumberland.
NHS England says another £20m will be shared out in 2017.
The childbirth charity NCT said the funding was welcome but there was still a long way to go to help all of the 140,000 women every year in the UK who suffer from mental health problems when they are pregnant or during the year after they give birth - known as the perinatal period.
Elizabeth Duff, NCT senior policy adviser, said their research found that only 3% of NHS local commissioning groups had a perinatal mental health strategy.
""We're particularly pleased to see plans to enable mothers who have experienced similar issues to help others.
""Peer support can be a really powerful way to further break the stigma around perinatal mental health.""
Natalie Ellis, from Sheffield, began to hate everything about herself soon after her son Finn, now seven years old, was born.
She had suffered from depression before - but this was different.
A news story about pornographic images being taken of young children being abused had really upset her and she found she could not get the abuse out of her head.
She began to have other, more troubling thoughts - she started wondering if she could be capable of abusing her own son.
These intrusive thoughts would not go away, torturing her for nearly a year, and because she was too scared to tell anyone about them she spiralled into a terrible depression.
She admits: ""I had a deep hate for myself. I thought I'd rather be dead than hurt Finn.
""I thought I was a monster.""
When she went back to work, she found the courage to look up her feelings on the internet and discovered that they were a recognised symptom of post-natal illness.
The relief she felt was huge - ""I broke down, ran out of the office and sobbed.""
Her GP set up counselling and cognitive behavioural therapy and she went on to anti-depressants, but she says it was the online support which really helped turn her life around.
""The women on the PNI forum saved my life, because no-one judged me,"" she says.
""They were a massive support network.""
NHS England is also announcing that anyone who walks through the doors of A&E in a mental health crisis should be seen by a specialist mental health professional within an hour of being referred.
They should also be properly assessed and the next steps for their care planned within four hours.
Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""Patients in crisis and expectant and new mothers who are suffering from severe mental health problems need urgent support and care.
""So this investment is fantastic news and will help make sure patients get the care they need, when they need it.""
Janet Fyle, professional policy adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, said there was still more to do to prevent some women with pregnancy-related mental illness having to travel miles away from their families when they were in crisis.
""The RCM would like to see a specialist maternal mental health midwife in post in every maternity unit and trained to the standards developed by the RCM,"" she said.
""We cannot continue to read the constant reports of the number of women killing themselves because they were not identified earlier and treated, or because of the lack of trained staff or as a result of lack of services - it's heartbreaking and we can do better as a country.""

"Newcastle University said the killing of its students Neil Dalton and Aidan Brunger, both 22, was a ""huge shock"".
Malaysian police said the men were killed at about 04:15 local time on Wednesday.
There had been an argument between a man and one victim before the killings, and four men have been arrested over the murders, police added.
Mr Dalton, from Ambergate, Belper in Derbyshire, and Mr Brunger from Hempstead, Gillingham in Kent, were in the final week of a six-week work placement at a hospital in Kuching, a city in one of the two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo.

Ms Power last week said the international community ""isn't just losing the race to Ebola. We are getting lapped"", and even praised Cuba - under a US embargo for decades - for its supply of doctors to Sierra Leone.
The Pentagon announced that a new commander, Maj Gen Gary Volesky, had taken over the US military mission to fight Ebola in West Africa.
It said that troops from the US 101st Division who arrived in Liberia 38 days ago had established two new laboratories and that a 25-bed hospital should be operational in the capital Monrovia by November.
The US has pledged 4,000 troops to build hospitals and to train health workers in West Africa, some 600 of whom have already arrived.
However, new rules in some parts of the US on quarantining returning health workers have drawn criticism.
A nurse put into isolation on her return from treating patients in Sierra Leone expressed anger at the way she was dealt with at Newark airport.
Kaci Hickox, of medical charity Doctors Without Borders, said the experience was frightening, and described seeing a ""frenzy of disorganisation, fear and most frightening, quarantine"".
She said she was kept in isolation at the airport terminal for seven hours and given only a cereal bar to eat.
New York, New Jersey and Illinois have imposed stricter quarantine rules than those at the federal level.
In the three states, anyone who has had contact with Ebola victims in West Africa now faces a mandatory 21-day quarantine period.
The White House said the states' stricter rules could put off aid workers and others travelling to West Africa to help mitigate the crisis at its source.
Although Ms Hickox tested negative in a preliminary test for the virus, she will remain under quarantine for three weeks and continue to be monitored by health officials.
The stricter measures were put in place in New York and New Jersey after a doctor, Craig Spencer, tested positive for the virus on his return from Guinea last week.
US President Barack Obama said in his weekly radio and online address that Americans had ""to be guided by the facts - not fear"".

"Members of the drivers union Aslef are due to walk out for three days in the dispute over driver-only trains.
Southern's parent company Govia Thameslink (GTR) has asked the Court of Appeal to overturn last week's High Court refusal to ban the strike action.
A decision will be given at the end of the hearing, due to last all day.
Lord Justice Elias, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Lloyd Jones, have been asked to overturn the refusal to grant an injunction blocking the ""unprecedented"" action.
GTR has already been hit by a series of strikes by the RMT union in a long-running dispute over the role of conductors.
Drivers are due to strike on Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday, with a week-long walkout planned from 9 to 14 January.
Southern said given the timing of the Court of Appeal's decision, it would be too late to get trains and drivers in the correct position for Tuesday, and any services it could run would be ""extremely limited"".
Angie Doll, passenger services director, said: ""We hope for the sake of our passengers our application to the Court of Appeal is successful.
""Even if we are able to stop the strikes through the court, services will still be very heavily  impacted tomorrow.
""We will work through the night to try and provide as many services as possible, but we are still advising passengers not to travel as we will not be able to offer a robust service they can rely on.
""We are sorry but the industrial action by Aslef leaves us no viable alternative, but be assured we will do all we can overnight,"" she said.

"South Wales Police has confirmed that the matter is closed and that the three complainants have been told.
The force said it has informed Operation Hydrant, which oversees allegations of historical child sex abuse against high-profile people.
Lord Tonypandy, who was born in Port Talbot, died of cancer in 1997 aged 88.
Then known as George Thomas, he was a Labour MP in Cardiff from 1945 to 1983.
The methodist preacher was also Secretary of State for Wales from 1968 to 1970 and was Commons Speaker between 1976 and 1983.
Allegations of historical child sexual abuse were made against him four years ago.
A man, now in his fifties, living in Australia, alleged that Lord Tonypandy had sexually assaulted him in Cardiff when he was nine years old while he was staying at the boy's parents home in the 1960s and 1970s.
Other allegations against him included that he sexually assaulted a 16 or 17-year-old boy on a train between Newport and London in the 1960s.
There were also claims he inappropriately touched someone on a train from London to Aberystwyth in 1959.
On Wednesday, South Wales Police said its investigation has come to an end and that no further action would be taken.
""These allegations have been investigated proportionately by South Wales Police in line with national guidance,"" it said in a statement.
""The force takes all allegations of sexual abuse seriously no matter when the alleged offence took place and encourages any victims of sexual abuse to come forward, in the knowledge that they will be listened to and their allegations taken seriously.""
Friends and people who knew Lord Tonypandy have previously said they found the allegations difficult to believe.",An investigation into sex abuse claims made against the former Speaker of the House of Commons Viscount Tonypandy has ended.
"The flame was also taken on a cliff top chair-lift at The Needles when it arrived on the island en-route from  
          Bournemouth to Southampton
.
Sailing Olympian Shirley Robertson carried the flame in Newport.
The day began at Bournemouth Pier and the 59-mile route will include a stop at Southampton football club's ground.
The flame travelled through 12 communities on Saturday: Bournemouth, Boscombe, Christchurch, Lyndhurst, Brockenhurst, Lymington, Totland, Yarmouth, Carisbrooke, Newport, East Cowes and Southampton.
At midday the convoy boarded a ferry from Lymington to the Isle of Wight.
And fittingly, it was there that sailor Dame Ellen joined the relay in East Cowes which is famous for its week-long regatta.
Cowes has hosted the sailing event since 1826 and it is now the largest of its kind in the world.
Dame Ellen is best-known as a solo long-distance yachtswoman, who once held the world record for the fastest solo circumnavigation of the globe.
She said after carrying the torch: ""The other torchbearers are inspiring people who were wonderful to meet but the strongest impression I have from today are the faces - smiles, smiles and more smiles from young and old alike.
""The sense of pride, happiness and community was my lasting feeling - all brought alive, in an instant, by the Olympic torch.""
Another of Britain's finest sailors, Ms Robertson, was among the day's 92 torchbearers. She was the first British woman to win two Olympic gold medals at consecutive games - in Sydney 2000 and then four years later in Athens.

"The action will take place on 25 January and 1 February and affect Neath Port Talbot Hospital, Morriston in Swansea and Princess of Wales in Bridgend.
Unison said non-emergency surgery was ""likely to be severely disrupted"".
The health board said it was fully committed to resolving concerns.
Unison said affected members at Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board wanted ""pay parity with colleagues doing the same job in other hospitals in Wales"".
Earlier this month, 54 staff members voted in favour of taking the industrial action, with two voting no, the turnout for the ballot was 78.9%.
Mark Turner, Unison organiser for ABMU, added: ""They are highly skilled technicians of many years training yet are treated as though they have just walked in off the street.
""They are extremely disappointed that after two years of discussions the health board continues to ignore their very reasonable claim in the hope they will go away.""
The health board said all staff were valued and it had been working with the trade union to develop a new job description.
The board said the current service needed a workforce with a mixture of skills at different bands.
""We are sorry our continuing discussions with Unison have not been able to resolve our staff's concerns,"" a spokesman added.
""We remain fully committed to continuing our partnership work with Unison to resolve these concerns and have offered to involve ACAS to assist with this issue.

"More than 200 pupils at St George's Preparatory School in Jersey were due to have a day at the beach in July.

He said the school may ""resurrect"" its visit to the beach in future years if adequate shading is available.
The average Jersey temperature in July is 14C to 20C, compared with 11C to 19C in the UK, according to the Met Office.

"Iranian patrol boats surrounded a US cargo ship in the strait on Friday.
Earlier this week, Iranian naval ships reportedly fired warning shots near a Marshall Islands-flagged cargo ship before seizing it and its crew.
The strait connects the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf.
The US navy will not be escorting the ships - a different procedure from accompanying them. Instead, it will monitor the area as the ships pass across the strait.
The crew of the Marshall Islands-flagged container ship seized by Iran in the strait on Tuesday are safe and ""in good spirits"", Danish shipping company Maersk said.
Maersk said it still did not know the reason why the Marshall Islands-flagged vessel was seized, and noted it had been in an international shipping lane.
Iranian media cited an official as saying the ship was seized based on a court order in connection with a complaint made by a private Iranian company about debts.
The crew includes a British national, but no Americans, as initial reports suggested.
The narrow strait lies partly in Iranian waters.
Shipping traffic is allowed to pass through under an internationally-recognised protocol called ""innocent passage"", so long as the ships are not carrying weapons, collecting intelligence, or violating other restrictions.","Defence officials have said that US Navy ships will accompany US-flagged commercial vessels through the Strait of Hormuz, to make sure they are not interfered with by Iran."
"Manbij sits on an intersection of roads linking the IS stronghold of Raqqa to the Turkish border and other areas under its control in Aleppo province.
The routes have become key to the group's ability to move fighters, weapons and supplies into and out of Syria.
On 31 May, a US-backed alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters called the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) began an operation to take Manbij and cut the supply routes.
After some heavy fighting, Manbij was encircled and completely cut off earlier this month.
We steered clear of the main roads leading to the town as our guides warned us that IS had planted mines and roadside bombs. So we bumped along on dusty side roads.
On the way in we passed through Kobane, a town on the border with Turkey that was wrested back from IS control by Kurdish-led forces in January 2015, after a gruelling four-month battle.
Much of Kobane is now in ruins and pictures of Kurdish fighters - both women and men - who were killed in the fighting festoon the wrecked buildings.
As we get closer to the frontline near Manbij, some 55km (35 miles) to the south-east, we saw the first of the hundreds of civilians who have fled their homes since the fighting began.
They were mainly Arab villagers, camped out along the roadside and flying white flags.
When they saw an SDF vehicle, they ran forwards begging for food and water.
A young SDF fighter, also an Arab, was clearly moved.
""We are at the gates of Manbij now,"" he told us.
""God willing, we will end Daesh injustice in Manbij and liberate our families and this city from them,"" he added, using an Arabic acronym based on the previous name of IS.
We were taken to the site of an IS base which was recently destroyed in a US-led coalition air strike.
The bodies of dead IS militants were still lying in the field.
Kurdish fighters pointed out one who appeared to be Sudanese and another they said was a Chechen.
One of the militants was still wearing a suicide belt. In death, his fingers were frozen inches from the detonator.
Much of the SDF advance in this area was made possible by US-led coalition air support, and we could hear warplanes circling overhead.
The air strikes are being directed by foreign special forces personnel on the ground, as we saw for ourselves when we ran into a group of them close to the frontline.
They appeared to be French and American and told us to stop filming.
The Kurdish fighters told us there were also British special forces operating in the area.
Although air power has been decisive, it is not without cost.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, 49 civilians have been killed in air strikes since the offensive on Manbij began.
Civilians are often caught in the crossfire on the ground too.
In a field just behind the frontline, we came across a group of families huddled together for shelter.
Out of nowhere bullets start flying overhead and everyone had to run for cover.
We discovered that their village, which we had passed through just 10 minutes earlier, was under attack. It was a lucky escape for all of us.
At an eastern forward position, a group of Arab fighters were keeping watch on the top of a building overlooking Manbij.
Suddenly they shouted: ""Daesh! Daesh!"" They had caught sight of a column of people heading out of the town.
Clearly in a panic, the Arab fighters started shooting and prepared to fire a rocket-propelled grenade.
Then someone shouted that the people heading their way were civilians and not IS militants.
Down below, cars, tractors and people on foot were slowly making their way out of Manbij. Miraculously no-one had been hurt by the gunfire.
We went to talk to some of them.
""IS killed us and killed our children,"" said Dabahan Wilad, an old man who was wearing traditional Arab dress.
""They made us grow long beards, and told us what to wear. The women had to be covered. May God help us!"" he added.
The civilians told us there is no water or power in Manbij. Food had become very expensive and the IS militants had dug in for a fight, they said.
""It's a disgrace,"" shouted one woman, dressed in black and sitting on the back of a tractor. ""There are kids and old people with us. We had to gather them all up and put them in cars to escape.""
The Syrian Observatory says 19 civilians have been killed by IS since the battle began.
There are about 8,000 SDF fighters taking part in the battle for Manbij.
Officially, the US says that the Arab fighters are leading the operation, but on the ground it is clear that it is the battle-hardened Kurdish commanders from the People's Protection Units (YPG) who are leading the offensive.
This is a hugely sensitive issue across the border in Turkey.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has made it clear he sees no distinction between the Syrian YPG, and the rebel Turkish Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Turkey considers a terrorist organisation.
Mr Erdogan has repeatedly called on the US not to support the Kurds, and last year he warned them not to cross what he called the ""red line"" of the Euphrates river, which runs between Manbij and Kobane.
But it is a red line the Kurdish and Arab fighters of the SDF have now gone well beyond.
The reality on the ground is that the Kurds and their Arab allies in the SDF now control more than 500km (310 miles) of the Turkish-Syrian border.
The Kurds call the area ""Rojava"", or ""Western Kurdistan"", and they make no secret of the fact that their goal is to capture Jarablus - the last remaining Syrian border town under IS control.
If they did this, almost the entire Turkish Syrian border would be under SDF control, with a tiny section around the western town of Azaz held by Arab rebel forces.
But that seems unlikely to happen soon.
Manbij is surrounded, but the offensive has drawn to a halt.
SDF forces told us that although they had reached the edge of the city, because of pressure from Turkey and the US they were not going any further for now.","We travelled along the road to Manbij, a small town in northern Syria that has become the new frontline in the battle against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS)."

Even fewer could have imagined just how the game would ebb and flow, and ultimately provide Aberdeen with their first chance in 17 years to win a cup they treated as their own in the eighties.
In 1990, as Alex McLeish lifted the trophy just as Willie Miller had done four times in the preceding decade, it would have seemed inconceivable they would not do so again.
But those are the bare facts. And four consecutive losing semi-finals ensured no-one took victory today for granted.
And yet Aberdeen began the match with such a sense of authority and superiority that all doubt seemed to have been banished inside the opening 25 minutes.
Their desire to press Hibernian paid off in the opening seconds - a swifter reward than Derek McInnes could have possibly dreamed of.
But it was a tactic they continued to employ to great effect, snapping into tackles and denying the Hibernian backline and midfield any time or space to develop their game-plan.
The ploy looked a masterstroke from McInnes, but then Neil Lennon changed the game with one of his own.
The introduction of Grant Holt and a change of shape brought Hibs back from the dead - all of a sudden Hibs were able to play the ball forward and not find it coming instantly back on top of them.
Again his goal was a quicker pay-off than Lennon could have hoped for, but his overall impact - in particular his pass for Dylan McGeouch's equaliser - was phenomenal.
That equaliser came moments after another tactical switch - this time by Derek McInnes - whose decision to move to a back three appeared to play into Hibernian's hands.
The Hibs comeback was a significant test of Aberdeen's resolve. Having been so comfortable for 30 minutes, they were rattled by Holt's goal and at 2-2 the clever money was on the resurgent men from Leith.
But Aberdeen's determination to avoid a fifth successive Scottish Cup semi-final defeat kicked in and they clawed their way back into the game.
McInnes's assertion that they were deserved winners is a generous one, but they stuck steadfastly to their task and though Jonny Hayes' winner had a huge slice of luck attached to it, Aberdeen now have the opportunity to make amends for a tame League Cup final showing earlier in the season.
After the match, Lennon declined to accept the tag of gallant losers, insisting his team were simply losers.
It's a harsh assessment but an indication of the standards the Hibs manager demands - and will continue to demand - from his side.
Lennon has not amassed the medals he has won as a player and manager by accepting second-best, which is what his side were by some distance in the opening half-hour.
But he can take solace - on reflection - in the manner his team dug in to give the country's second-best team quite a fright.
He can now turn his attention fully to building for next season's return to the Premiership. A few astute signings could ensure they are challenging in the upper half of the table this time next year.
For Derek McInnes, though, the short-term requires his full attention. Second place in the Premiership looks a safe bet, though not yet an absolute certainty.
But he and his players could make a real name for themselves back at Hampden on 27 May if they can end the 27-year wait to reclaim the Scottish Cup.",Few observers predicted anything other than a closely-fought match between the Championship winners and the second-best team in the country.

"After the best part of a century of service, the traditional steel ""lattice"" pylon has been updated.
The ""T-pylon"" is shorter, standing at about 120ft (36m); the old steel giants are typically 165ft (50m).
The National Grid says it will respond to the need to harvest energy from an increasing number of lower-carbon energy sources.
The new tower can be shorter yet still capable of operating at 400,000 volts because of the way the cables are held in place.
Instead of being attached to three arms, a diamond arrangement is used to carry the cables off in one arm in a much smaller space.
Each arm has to carry 60 tonnes. With only eight main structural components plus bolts, it is easier to erect and install - taking a day rather than a week.
According to the National Grid, new pylons are needed to respond to the move away from coal and towards other forms of generation such as wind, solar and nuclear.
These new low-carbon energy sources come from different geographical locations to the ""traditional ring"" of coal-fired generation in the centre of England.
This test line won't be connected to the rest of the grid, it will be used to train staff and contractors.
In particular, it will be used for people to practise ""stringing"" the conductors (wires) on to the pylons, as a very different technique is needed.
The T-Pylon design was adopted after an international competition held by the National Grid in 2011, won by Danish company Bystrup.
The claim is that these pylons will be less obtrusive not just because of their shorter stature, but because the design allows them to ""follow the contours of the land"".
According to project manager Alan Large, maintenance will be easier because operators will not have to climb up the tower, they will work from elevated platforms positioned alongside it. Their smooth, impenetrable surface will also make them more difficult to vandalise.
It won't replace the 88,000 lattice pylons that currently bestride the UK countryside. It will principally be used in the construction of new power lines in England and Wales.
The National Grid is applying to use them to connect the new Hinkley Point C nuclear power station to the UK's electricity transmission network.
The start of the UK's electricity transmission network began with the building of the first pylon in 1928 near Edinburgh.

"After the show, a cast member thanked Mr Pence for attending and read a letter to him on stage.
""We, sir, are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us,"" Brandon Dixon said.
The incident has angered President-elect Donald Trump, who has accused the cast of ""harassing"" his running mate.
The President-elect has gone as far as to demand an apology to a ""very good man"", apparently misunderstanding that the cast implored the audience to stop booing Mr Pence.
""Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen!"" Mr Trump tweeted.
""The theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!""
His tweet did not go unnoticed by Mr Dixon, who immediately stepped in to defend his castmates.
""@realDonaldTrump conversation is not harassment sir,"" he wrote. ""And I appreciate @mike_pence for stopping to listen.""
Mr Pence was loudly booed as he entered the theatre. Audience members said the performance was repeatedly stopped because of jeers.
However, the message, which was reportedly penned by the show's writers when they learned that Mr Pence planned to attend, was greeted with cheers from the audience at the Richard Rogers Theatre in New York.
An audience member tweeted to say there was a three-minute standing ovation when one character performed a song directly to Mr Pence which included the lyrics: ""A small query for you / What comes next? / You've been freed / Do you know how hard it is to lead?""
When Mr Dixon addressed theatregoers at the end, he urged them not to boo and asked Mr Pence, who was leaving, to stay and listen.
""You know, we had a guest in the audience this evening, and Vice-President-elect Pence, I see you are walking out but I hope you will hear us.
""There's nothing to boo here, ladies and gentlemen... We have a message for you, sir, and we hope you will hear us out.""
Mr Dixon continued: ""We truly hope that his show has inspired you to uphold our American values and work on behalf of all of us.
""We truly thank you for sharing this wonderful American story told by a diverse group of men and women of different colours, creeds, and orientations.""

"Ramute Butkiene's remains were discovered after an unpleasant smell was reported coming from a room rented by boyfriend Vytautas Jokubauskas.
Jokubauskas, 57, of Mayor's Walk, Peterborough, was found guilty of her murder by a Southwark Crown Court jury.
Judge Nicholas Loraine Smith sentenced him to a minimum of 20 years in prison.
Jokubauskas, who had denied murder but admitted manslaughter, also pleaded guilty to preventing the burial of a corpse at an earlier hearing.
The torso of Ms Butkiene, 42, was found in the locked room on 5 June this year.
Jokubauskas had strangled Ms Butkiene with the cord from her dressing gown around a week ealier, the court heard, after accusing her of seeing another man.
He then dismembered her body before watching war films and drinking whisky with her torso stuffed into a suitcase next to him.
Jokubauskas buried her arms and legs in nearby wooded areas and disposed of her head before going on the run, jurors were told.
He was tracked down and arrested on 7 June, just a few streets away from where he had left his girlfriend's body.
During interview, he told police ""I am a killer"" and said he had strangled his girlfriend ""just a little"" to scare her.
Speaking after the sentence, Det Insp Pushpa Guild said: ""This was a gruesome crime against an innocent woman, all because of a moment of jealousy.
""In a moment of rage, Jokubauskas killed Ramute and then butchered her in an attempt to cover his tracks.""","A ""jealous"" man who murdered his partner before dismembering her and stuffing her torso into a suitcase has been jailed for life."

""It's like an early Christmas present,"" Groves told BBC Radio Cornwall.
""The good news means that we can now crack on at the beginning of next year with getting the refinancing [of the club] organised.""
Pirates have been attempting to make progress with their proposed 6,000-capacity ground for several years, but it has been complicated by Cornish football side Truro City also wanting to build a new stadium.
Asked when work on the prospective stadium will start, Groves added: ""That's the question - my guess is sometime in the middle of next year.
""The first stage is refinancing and recapitalising the Pirates, the second is around the stadium design and building a sustainable business, and the third phase is around a rugby partnership.""
The rugby partnership is with Super Rugby franchise Waikato Chiefs, whose chairman Dallas Fisher is visiting England in January.
Groves says there could be potential for player swaps with the New Zealand side in future.
""That is an idea going forwards, probably a couple of years down the track,"" he said. ""I would describe it more like IP [intellectual property] swap - coaches, and maybe one or two players.
""The first thing we've been focusing on at the moment is steadying the ship. I don't think people realised how bad the financial situation was at the end of September - the Pirates were pretty close to going into bankruptcy or administration.""","Cornish Pirates director Colin Groves has estimated that work on the Stadium for Cornwall will start ""in the middle of 2017""."
"Express Wi-fi allows users to purchase data from local providers in order to access the web.
A pilot version with a state-run telecoms company has already been offered at 125 rural wi-fi hotspots.
In a statement, Facebook said the tests were being carried out with ""multiple local ISP partners"".
Facebook is probably hoping that users who first encounter the web via a Facebook initiative will be more likely to become users of the social network - rather than a competitor - according to Ian Fogg, an analyst at IHS Technology.
""In emerging economies, Facebook is pursuing an intervention strategy to increase the pace of internet and online usage because this will also raise the addressable market for Facebook,"" he told the BBC.

"The pair, co-founders of the Leon restaurant chain, led a government commissioned independent review of school food, published two years ago.
Their report formed the basis of revised rules on school dinners in England, brought in earlier this year.
John Vincent said the aim was to bring about a cultural change in schools.
It was vital to boost the uptake of school dinners to promote ""a virtuous cycle of quality"" and simply changing the rules on what could be served was not enough, said Mr Vincent.
Introducing free school meals for all infant pupils and more cookery lessons in schools would help, he argued, but ""treating individual children as customers, sorting out the queues and making the food great"", were key.
Ultimately the pair believe better nutrition in schools will help both boost attainment and improve the nation's health.
Mr Vincent called the work ""a massive privilege and a character building task"".
""This recognition is a tribute to all of the people who work hard every day to provide health, pleasure and improved attainment to our children,"" he said.
In 2012 the pair were asked  to examine nutrition in England's schools and suggest improvements.
Their  School Food Plan, was published a year later.
Mr Dimbleby said they had become involved at a time when improvements in school catering were already under way.
A campaign fronted by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver had already brought about changes to the quality of food served in English schools - but less than half of children actually ate them, with many preferring packed lunches of variable nutritional quality.
Their current aim is to showcase best practice in school catering and bring about ""a golden age for school food"".
""I think it's reflective of the fact that the sector, which used to work quite disparately, doing lots of good things, has really come together and there's an amazing, positive, constructive atmosphere of improvement across the country,"" said Mr Dimbleby.
""I think the MBE is recognition of that, rather than anything John and I have done.""
Mr Dimbleby said he was always impressed by what he saw when he went into schools.
""There's real change happening, in five years time the whole sector will be completely transformed.""
Under the new rules, which came into force in January, meals must include at least one portion of vegetables or salad every day and no more than two portions of fried foods or pastry-based foods a week.
The regulations are mandatory for local authority schools as well academies set up before 2010 or after June 2014.
However academies set up between 2010 and June 2014 are exempt, a source of frustration to campaigners.
The government maintains it has encouraged these academies to sign up voluntarily to the new standards and that hundreds have already done so.
In total, about 11% of recipients on the honours list have been recognised for their work in the education sector. Others include Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, who becomes a CBE.

"The match was in memory of the late Falkirk defender, Craig Gowans, 17, who died in 2005.
Guinness World Records are expected to approve the record set by the Craig Gowans Memorial Fund World Record Breaking Football Match within days.
The final score at Ainslie Park, at 22:00 on Wednesday, was 774-707.
The match started on Saturday at 13:00.
The previous record was 102 hours.
Craig Gowans was killed when training equipment he was carrying connected with an overhead power cable at the Little Kerse ground in Grangemouth.
The Craig Gowans Memorial Fund for The Sick Kids Friends Foundation has so far raised almost Â£80,000.
The match was played using seven substitutes on each side. There were no limits on how many times a substitute was used.
Every 12 hours a player clocked up on the pitch gave them one hour off from the match to have a shower or get food.
Eoghan Molloy, a member of the Craig Gowans Memorial Fund organising committee, said: ""The whole experience has been an emotional rollercoaster from start to finish.
""There were a lot of mixed emotions as the final whistle blew - from relief and tiredness to joy, happiness and everything in between. It was amazing to hear that final whistle and to finish what we set to achieve.
""I'd like to extend a huge thank you to all of the supporters and volunteers who came down to support us across the four days.
""Playing throughout the night was by far the most difficult part of the challenge, but when the sun came up and the crowd returned this completely lifted our spirits. Being able to finish the match is all down to these supporters.""
Roslyn Neely, chief executive of the Sick Kids Friends Foundation, said: ""All of the participants of the Craig Gowans Memorial Fund have done a tremendous job in completely this outstanding challenge and we feel extremely privileged to be the beneficiary of their efforts. ""
The money raised will be used to fund enhancements to the new Sick Kids hospital at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh at Little France, specifically a state-of-the-art Snoezelen room in Craig's name.
The space will be a calming room with multi-sensory equipment providing a relaxing and stimulating space for children with sensory impairments.
The previous world record was set at St Mary's, the home of Southampton FC, in June by two squads representing the Testlands Support Project, a Southampton charity.
Doug Henderson, chairman of Falkirk FC, said: ""I'd like to congratulate the team for their great efforts over a monumental 105 hours, and to thank them also for getting together to deliver this wonderful tribute to Craig Gowans.
""Craig was an upstanding young man with a great future ahead of him, he had enormous promise as a footballer and was a big part of our Falkirk family. We all miss him so much.""",A world record breaking attempt for the longest 11-a-side match has finished following 105 hours of football in Edinburgh.
"The move was part of a plan to clear a 100m (328ft) security zone around the camp's perimeter, an official told AP.
But some migrants and activists said the places of worship had not been included in the demolition plans, local media reported.
The Jungle is used by about 5,000 migrants who say they want to reach the UK.
The church's pastor clashed with police during the demolition but the mosque had already been abandoned and there were no protests, the unnamed official said.
No-one was hurt and the migrants were free to build new churches and mosques, the official added.
However, civil society groups working in the camp claimed the authorities had promised not to demolish them in the first place.
""It was agreed that the church and the mosque would stay. By demolishing them, the authorities are showing contempt for NGOs (non-governmental organisations) and are seeking conflict with the migrants who used these places,"" said Christian Salome of the NGO Auberge des Migrants, the Voix du Nord newspaper reported.

The European Commission said the plans, which would also remove banners for non-intrusive cookies, would help to tackle an ""overload"" of such requests.
But experts warned the plans could harm advert-funded media, as well as platforms such as Facebook and Google.
Cookies are small files that download on to a user's device and enable tracking, sometimes to power advertising.
Since 2012, EU rules have required websites to tell users what cookies are being placed on their machine.
Typically, this meant a pop-up window seeking consent.
European Commission vice-president, Andrus Ansip, said it was now proposing simpler rules, ""so that internet users do not have to click on a banner every time they visit a website"".
""This way, people will be more in control of their settings,"" he said.
Under the plans, websites could read the cookie preferences set in users' browsers.
Also, banners would be scrapped for cookies that do not invade users' privacy, such as those remembering shopping cart history or counting website hits.
Last year, many internet companies called for the EU to scrap the so-called ""cookie law"", introduced in 2012.
However, the latest proposals could end up damaging online services and frustrate web users, according to a senior executive at a trade body that represents many of the world's biggest internet firms.
""The banners are certainly annoying. The question is whether they come up with something that's better or worse,"" said James Waterworth, vice-president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association.
He warned the proposals could harm a range of companies, from Facebook through to newspapers, if many users opted against allowing all but the least intrusive cookies.
""If this is done wrong and it's much harder to obtain permission, then it could have a serious impact on ad-funded services,"" he told the BBC.

Paul McMullen and James Keatings scored their first United goals in the Group C tie.
McMullan broke the deadlock when he curled a shot high into the corner to beat Raith goalkeeper Aaron Lennox.
Keatings' scored from the penalty spot in the second half to make the points safe for the home side.
However, it is Cowdenbeath who occupy top spot in the group, on goals scored, after they won 4-2 against Highland League champions Buckie Thistle.
United's best effort in the first half came in the opening minute when McMullan hit a low shot with the right foot after cutting in from the left to test Lennox, who fumbled but held the ball at the second attempt.
Raith should have gone ahead when Mehmet mishit a clearance straight at Greig Spence who squared to Liam Buchanan, but his 20-yard effort towards an open goal was headed off the line by Mark Durnan.
Keatings' shot after the restart brought a save from Lennox and the tempo of the game went up a notch, then a touch of class from McMullan from the left of the box saw him pick out the top corner for United's opener.

"No, not getting your hands on a ticket to the premiere of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Much, much more difficult will be to avoid all mention of the film anywhere for the next few weeks.
If you are one of the people not so keen on catching the latest installment and wanting to avoid all reference to it, you have already failed by clicking on this article.
But while you're here, you might as well carry on reading: here are some invaluable pointers for how to keep your head down until the hype has passed.
Or Chad. Or North Korea.
If online interest in the film is any indication, you're in deep trouble if you're not into Star Wars and live in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand and (for some reason) Hungary - that's where interest is at its most feverish.
A quick look at the rest of Google's map shows a bigger picture though:
Some pretty big areas don't really care that much about Star Wars, so you could move there. Most of Africa doesn't seem too bothered, and the same goes for central America, where the weather is quite pleasant at this time of the year.
(For the record - the map is likely to be blank in some countries due to a lack of data available to Google, rather than an aversion to sci-fi.)
The film's page on the IMDb film database shows it is opening in more than 80 countries in the next month - China is the last to get it on 9 January.
Incidentally, if you are in Bhutan, we can't say whether The Force Awakens will be shown there - the country's two cinemas have not yet replied to the BBC.
This goes without saying.
Even traditional art-house cinemas in London have jumped on the bandwagon, with some offering screenings from midnight on Thursday. The regularity of screenings makes listings for some cinemas look more like bus timetables.
In the middle of this, however, is the Institute of Contemporary Arts in central London, where Friday night will see a Q&A on Catalan avant-garde cinema.
A spokeswoman for the ICA told the BBC it will not be screening the film at any point, nor will it be showing any Star Wars trailers - they show trailers only for independent films that will be screened at the venue.
Quite a few people are expected to see the film. Some might reasonably be expected to discuss it afterwards, so avoiding humans altogether is perhaps the best policy.
Having said that, not as many people might see it as you would expect.
In the US, it is opening in 3,900 screens, and while that sounds like a lot, it is actually some 500 fewer than for the third Twilight film in 2010. This had led Forbes to speculate that The Force Awakens may not end up being the highest-grossing film of all time.
If you're going to avoid all humans, it might be wise to do so online too.
As of 10:50 GMT on Monday, the film was not a trending topic on Twitter - at least not yet. That honour, in the US at least, belongs to #ReplaceAWordInASongWithJelly - among others. But it is surely a matter of time.
As it stands, here's a challenge: go online, try and look up some news, scroll through your Facebook feed. See how long it will take you to find a reference to Star Wars. When we tried, it took us only 37 seconds.
This may seem like an extreme option. But it is worth considering.
Even if you discover another cinema not showing The Force Awakens, or find a new friend uninterested in space opera, on your way to seeing an alternative film, you may still spot posters, toys, a make-up range, jewellery or a kickboxing set bearing the Star Wars name.
Simply living in Los Angeles, ahead of the premiere on Monday, will have disrupted your life - part of the city is closed for four days in a move that's been called ""much more extensive than for a typical Hollywood movie premiere"".
It's going to be a long winter away from Star Wars. Pick a good thick book.",It is likely to prove to be one of the biggest challenges this year.
"Maughold Lighthouse, the closest point on the island to England, is situated about 31 miles (50km) from Cumbria.
It was designed and built by David A Stevenson, of the Stevenson engineers, at an estimated cost of £11,000.
The ceremony will be held on Sunday and attended by the island's Lieutenant Governor, Adam Wood.
A Northern Lighthouse Board (NLB) spokesman said: ""On 15 April, Maughold lighthouse will have provided a guiding beam of light to the mariner for 100 years.
""Battling against the odds, the Stevenson family constructed wonders of engineering that have withstood the test of time - an amazing historical achievement.""
David Stevenson was a Scottish lighthouse designer who designed over 30 lighthouses in Scotland.
The Stevensons also included the writer Robert Louis Stevenson, who was said to have gained inspiration for his books Kidnapped and Treasure Island from family visits to remote lighthouses in the British Isles.
The Northern Lighthouse Board was established in 1786 and is responsible for about 200 lighthouses.
In 1854 the organisation took responsibility for six Isle of Man lighthouses - Point of Ayre, Maughold Head, Douglas Head, Langness, Calf of Man and Chicken Rock.
Maughold was the last lighthouse to have been built on the island. Work began in 1911 and finished in April 1914.
It consists of a 23m (77ft) tower, which is situated on a slope of headland at Maughold Head.
""The building of the light at Maughold Head was not an easy task,"" said Lorna Hunter from the NLB.
""The tower is positioned half way down a cliff and can only be reached by a flight of 128 steps.""
The keeper's houses, now privately owned, are situated at the top of the cliff.
The coastal residence, which consists of four bedrooms and two bathrooms, was sold in 2012 for about £600,000.
The area between the lighthouse and Port-Vullen is a government-protected breeding ground for more than 35 bird species, including puffins and guillemots.
The original Frensel lens at Maughold was named after its French inventor, Augustin Fresnel.
It is made from a series of perfectly polished crystal glass lenses set into a brass structure.
The automated light, now monitored around the clock from a remote centre, is visited and maintained locally on a regular basis.
However, once a year, all the lighthouses on the island are visited by the vessel, NLV Pharos, when specialised technicians undertake a full service of the equipment.","A ceremony has been held in the Isle of Man to mark the centenary of a ""wonder of British engineering""."
"Molanna angustata is a type of caddisfly that inhabits Wales and England up to the Lake District and Yorkshire.
RSPB Scotland trainee ecologist Genevieve Dalley discovered and identified two males caught in a moth trap at Insh Marshes near Kingussie.
The flies' larvae live in water and create protective cases.
These tubes are made from tiny particles of sand and stuck together with silk.
When they have grown to a winged adult they chew their way out of the case and swim up to the surface where they eventually fly away.
However, this journey has to be done quickly or predators, such as fish, will eat them.
Ms Dalley said: ""It is fantastic to have discovered this new species, especially since it is the first ever record of its kind in Scotland.
""However, there is still a lot of work to be done if we want to fully understand this interesting little creature.
""We don't know why it's never been found in Scotland before - it could be that the species is starting to move north, or it could be that this type of caddisfly has simply gone unnoticed until now.""",A species of insect not previously recorded in Scotland has been found at an RSPB reserve in the Highlands.
"She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people should take more notice of their surroundings.
Measures such as the closure of railway stations in Munich on New Year's Eve would become more likely.
Such moves showed ""prudence and proper caution"" by authorities, she said.
Official guidance is that members of the public should be ""alert but not alarmed"" about the threat of terrorism.
But Lady Neville-Jones, former head of the Joint Intelligence Committee, said people were not as vigilant as they could be.
""I think being alert is very important,"" she said. ""I am alarmed by the number of people I see wandering along the street entirely engaged in their mobile telephones and with their ears plugged in to music.
""They're not aware of their surroundings - you need to be aware of your surroundings.""
When interviewer John Humphrys said that was ""how we should be able to lead our lives"", she added: ""Maybe, but I do think you need to take some personal responsibility.""
Two railway stations which were closed in Munich in response to a suspected terror threat reopened on Friday after German officials said there was no sign of an imminent attack.
Lady Neville-Jones said: ""I do think we are going to have to get used to what we have seen yesterday in Germany - that is to say alerts which close places of public functions, and higher levels of security in big public gatherings.
""That is prudence and proper caution on the part of intelligence and the police authorities.""
Authorities have a responsibility to take information seriously, even if the wider picture is not clear, she said.
""It's a very bold government or policeman who chooses not to take precautions in such circumstances,"" said Lady Neville-Jones.
""I think the population on the whole would prefer them to be cautious and occasionally have closed something that it turned out wasn't necessary, but how do we know, rather than take the risk of exposing people to dangers on which they have information, even if it's not complete and on which they can't necessarily totally rely.""
But she said UK cities were unlikely to be locked down in the way Brussels had been over recent terrorism concerns.
She told Today: ""I would hope that that would not be something that would happen in the UK.
""I do think that counter-terrorism and both the intelligence side of it and the policing side of it, and well done, are matters which are bred of long experience and of great skill and I think that in this country we do have both of those things and we have very close co-operation between both police and agencies and I think they understand how to use information.
""I don't think those skills are nearly so widespread on the continent. So I think we shouldn't conclude that what happened there is necessarily the technique that would be adopted here.""","Former security minister Baroness Neville-Jones says she is ""alarmed"" by people using mobile phones in public instead of being more alert to the risk of a potential terrorist attack."
"The World War Two cipher machine was bought at a flea market by a cryptography professor, who apparently recognised its true worth.
It was sold to an online bidder in Bucharest, Romania, on Tuesday.
Enigma machines were used to carry coded military communications during the war.
First developed in Germany in the 1920s, the codes created by the electromechanical encryption devices were eventually cracked by mathematician Alan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park.
Bucharest auction house Artmark put this particular Enigma machine on sale with a starting price of €9,000.
Cristian Gavrila, the collectible consignment manager at Artmark, told Reuters: ""The collector bought it from a flea market. He's a cryptography professor and... he knew very well what he was buying.""
However, the eventual sale price fell far short of the record amount for an Enigma machine at auction, after one sold at Christie's in New York for $547,500 last month.","A 100 euros typewriter has sold for 45,000 euros (£40,000; $51,500) at auction, after it was discovered it was actually a German Wehrmacht Enigma I."
"The cross-party group said speaking English was ""the key to full participation in our society and  economy"".
They also said ministers should consider letting different parts of the UK set their own immigration policy.
The government said it was spending Â£20m on English language provision.
Last month a report by Dame Louise Casey warned of ""worrying"" levels of segregation in some areas and called for more English classes for isolated groups.
The report by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Social Integration urges the government to go further, saying all immigrants should have either learnt English before coming to the UK or be required to sign up to classes when they arrive.
The group said integration should begin upon arrival in the UK and described speaking English as a ""prerequisite for meaningful engagement with most British people"".
The government has promised new migration controls once the UK leaves the EU but has not yet set out a detailed model.
According to the cross-party group, ""substantial"" immigration powers should be devolved to the UK's nations and regions, with devolved governments or city regions setting quotas.

50%+
of the increase is due to immigration
2.8m people in Britain are Muslim - the biggest religious group after Christians
70-85% of the populations in some wards in Blackburn, Birmingham, Burnley and Bradford are Muslim
511 schools in 43 areas take more than 50% pupils from Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds
27% of births in 2014 were to mothers born outside the UK
It said replacing the current ""one-size fits all"" approach would lead to a ""more positive"" public debate about immigration.
Addressing the ""economic and cultural needs"" of an area would ""have a positive knock-on effect on the public debate on immigration"", the report said, adding that this ""could instil confidence among members of the public that the immigration system works for their area, and give incentives for politicians to actively make the case for immigration in their area"".
Pointing to a similar model in use in Canada, where provincial governments can set region-specific requirements for immigrants, it said visas could be issued specifically for certain regions or certain sectors.
The report also called for a new national strategy to integrate immigrants, including ""awareness of the host country's laws, traditions and culture"" and access to the labour market, and for councils to set up local integration action plans.
Net migration is well above the government's target of below 100,000, and ministers have said they will reduce it after the UK leaves the EU and is no longer subject to freedom of movement rules.
Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who chairs the all-party group, said a ""meaningful"" integration programme would be needed when the rules are changed after Brexit.
He said: ""It's clear that immigration has impacted on different communities in different ways and the pace of change has alarmed many.
""The government has a duty to address the lack of integration of immigrants if it is to address this. Failing to do so has left a vacuum for extremists and peddlers of hate to exploit.""
The Home Office said it was not planning to introduce local visa arrangements, but the department said it had made funding available for more English lessons.
A government spokesman said: ""Our country has long been home to lots of different cultures and communities, but all of us have to be part of one society - British society.""
He said Â£140m was available through a ""controlling migration fund"" to help councils manage the impact of immigration.

"Sheffield City Council say the owner of Cake 'R' Us, in Devonshire Street, did not have consent for the work.
It says the shop must be repainted in a colour scheme ""more in keeping with its 19th Century characteristics"".
Owner David Chan said he had painted the shop in an ""act of national pride"".
Live updates on this story and others from Sheffield and South Yorkshire
A complaint about the shop, which is in part of the former Wharncliffe Fireclay Works built for John Armitage in 1888, was received in January 2015.
The council wrote to Mr Chan to say the design was ""unacceptable"" but was told he had ""no intention of repainting the shop"" and would instead apply for consent. It said though no application has yet been made.
Mr Chan said: ""It's the Union Jack. I do not see why it needs to be changed. I support Queen and country.""
Asked what he would do if the council took legal action to make him repaint the shop he said: ""I will write to the Queen. I do not see anything wrong with it. It's an act of national pride.""
A council report said: ""The union flag theme that has been applied to the shop front is considered to be visually intrusive and does not respect the original character of the property to which it is attached, due to its contemporary and garish design.
""Whilst the need of the business to advertise its presence and attract custom is recognised, this shop front has a deep fascia and projecting sign for these purposes, and there is no justification for garish and unsympathetic painting of the shop front to serve this purpose.""
The report recommends that the council's planning committee, which is due to meet on 26 April, agree to take any ""appropriate action including, if necessary, enforcement action and the institution of legal proceedings to secure repainting of the shop front"".","A man who painted the front of his Grade II listed shop with a ""garish and unsympathetic"" union flag is facing possible legal action for breaching planning regulations."
"""Islamists were starting to attack girls in the street,"" she says. ""I had to think about my daughters, so I decided to move to Canada.""
This was back in 1990, and Algeria was about to descend into more than a decade of civil war between a secular government and various Islamist groups.
Morocco-born Daniele was 34 at the time, and she and her Algerian husband lived a comfortable life with their four children. She worked as a political and economic adviser for the US consulate in the coastal city of Oran, while he was engineer.
But they gave up everything, almost overnight, to seek asylum in Canada.
The family arrived penniless in the city of Montreal in the middle of a bitterly cold Canadian winter, a snowstorm in full swing.
""Before moving, the immigration department of Canada had told us that my husband and I would easily find work,"" says Daniele. ""In reality, things turned out to be very different.""
While her husband Ahmad couldn't secure any work in his field, Daniele spent seven years scraping a living earning 75% less than she had done in Algeria. She did everything from working as a secretary, to selling lunchboxes, to trying her hand with an estate agents firm.
Daniele says she felt ""rejected and worthless"", but her life was to transform again for the better in 1997 when she decided to start her own business selling health and beauty products. She says she wanted to be her own boss because she was ""tired of being exploited"".
Her eponymous company has gone on to make her a multi-millionaire, and, today the 60-year-old is one of the best-known business leaders in the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec.
Born to a Moroccan mother and a German father whom she never met, Daniele was raised in Algeria.
At the age of 18 her mother forced her to have an arranged marriage with the best friend of her older brother.
""When my mother told me I had to marry Ahmad I screamed and cried. I was furious,"" says Daniele.
""I didn't want to get married, but I wanted to stay close to my family, so I eventually agreed. I was married within two weeks.""
Although she hadn't wanted the relationship, Daniele says she soon learned to love her husband. ""He was the perfect man. He was generous, smart and very loving.""
While he was a successful engineer, she quickly rose through the ranks at the US consulate after initially getting a low-grade job allocating visas.
So the couple built a happy life together in Algeria, until they were forced to flee the country.
In Canada, however, the marriage came under strain, which Daniele says was caused by Ahmad being unable to find work as an engineer. Ultimately they divorced, which she says made her feel ""very guilty"".
With four children to feed this put extra pressure on Daniele for her business to succeed.
Her idea was to create an exfoliating glove inspired by those used in Algerian and Moroccan bathhouses. Made of plant fibres (eucalyptus and spruce), the user would rub the glove over his or her wet skin to remove dead cells, and generally improve skin condition.
Daniele thought it would be popular, but it took a bit of explaining in 1990s Canada.
""There was nothing like it in Quebec [at the time],"" she says. ""When I would present my project, people would tell me: 'In Quebec we wear winter gloves, not exfoliating gloves.'""
Undeterred, Daniele found a manufacturer, and started visiting beauty salons in Montreal to persuade them to try the glove, which she called ""Renaissance"". She says that she wouldn't stop for the day until she had sold at least 250 Canadian dollars worth ($190; Â£150).
The popularity of the glove (which today costs C$26) quickly grew, with sales to both salons and members of the public.
""People liked my glove so much they started asking me for more products,"" says Daniele. ""That is how I realised I had a clientele.""
Almost two decades later, Daniele's business has sold millions of the gloves, and expanded to a health and beauty empire that includes a range of cosmetics, treatments for cellulite, burns, excess fat and acne, and a laboratory that develops tests to detect food intolerances.
Daniele has also become a celebrity in Quebec after appearing in the first five series of In The Eye Of The Dragon, Quebec's French language version of entrepreneurship TV show Dragons' Den.
The four other judges were always all men, and she says she sometimes felt they ""were not always interested"" in her views. However, Daniele made herself heard, winning her a lot of female fans.
""The experience made me realise how much business is a boys' club,"" she says. ""I was kind of the black sheep... but I took my rightful place.""
Canadian businessman Mitch Garber, who appeared with Daniele on the show, says she is a trailblazer.
Mr Garber, who is the chief executive of casino and online gaming group Caesars Interactive Entertainment, says: ""Daniele Henkel has done as much for the advancement of women entrepreneurs as anyone in Quebec, and for that she is credited and widely respected.""
Looking back on her often unconventional life so far, Daniele says it has taught her that you ""always have a choice"".
""Even when things that you can't control happen, you can always choose how you react to them,"" she says.",Daniele Henkel decided she had to flee Algeria because she felt her children were no longer safe.

"Bertie Acheson, who was 72, died after a confrontation with the intruder at his home in Glenmore Gardens, Coleraine, in April 2012.
Paul James Manolito Toland, originally of The Cedars, Antrim, had pleaded guilty to Mr Acheson's manslaughter.
After his release he must serve a further four and half years on licence.
Toland, a father of four, has 18 previous convictions for burglary.
He was confronted by his victim after he broke into the couple's home to steal money.
There was a struggle and Mr Acheson, who cared for his disabled wife Sheila, suffered a heart attack and died on his kitchen floor.
Speaking after the sentencing, the senior investigating officer in the case said the Acheson family had been left ""devastated"" by his loss, particularly his widow.
Det Ch Insp Ian Harrison said the fact that Toland was sentenced on what would have been Mr Acheson's 75th birthday had a ""double impact"" on the pensioner's loved ones.
""A person who I deem to be dangerous has now been taken off the streets and people can now feel safe in their homes,"" the officer said.
""Paul Toland was a predator. He preyed on the vulnerable and elderly and equally infirm couple who had been married for 44 years. His actions resulted in the death of Bertie Acheson, for just over Â£300.""
An earlier court hearing was told that the couple were woken up by the sound of breaking glass in the early hours of 20 April 2012.
Mr Acheson went to investigate.  His widow later told police she overheard a verbal altercation between her husband and an intruder, during which money was demanded.
Mrs Acheson claimed she also heard the sound of a scuffle and gasping for breath. She managed to raise the alarm, but when ambulance personnel and police arrived at the scene, her husband was already dead.
Toland had originally been charged with Mr Acheson's murder, but at a court hearing in October, a defence lawyer asked that his client be re-arraigned. Toland told Belfast Crown Court that he was not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.
He also admitted the robbery of Mrs Acheson, who had Â£335 stolen from her purse during the burglary.
Det Ch Insp Harrison paid tribute to the courage and resilience of the pensioner's family throughout the ""long and protracted inquiry"".
The officer said that Toland had been in the couple's house the previous month to repair a vacuum cleaner and had been paid in cash.
""We believe that Toland's greed brought him back to the house in the expectation that he could break in and steal whatever cash he could get his hands on,"" Det Ch Insp Harrison added.
He appealed to the public not to store cash at home saying they were exposing themselves to ""unnecessary risk"".
""In memory of Bertie Acheson, and to avoid the pain still being suffered by his family, please do not keep large amounts of money at home,"" the officer said.",A man has been jailed for four and a half years for killing a pensioner during a botched burglary at an elderly couple's home in County Londonderry.
"Profits at the retail partnership, which also owns Waitrose supermarkets, were held back by greater investment and by matching prices of competitors.
Profit before tax and bonuses was Â£353.8m for the year to 28 January, down 3.8% from the previous year.
The bonus pool for the firm's workers was Â£165.2m or 14% of salary, down from 18% last year.
The partnership is owned by its 77,217 staff, who receive a share of any profits at the end of the company's financial year.
Despite what the firm called ""difficult economic conditions"", total sales at its John Lewis department stores grew 3% while those at its Waitrose supermarkets rose 8.6%.
Like-for-like sales, excluding VAT and the effect of new store openings, rose by 3% at Waitrose, but fell at its department stores by 0.6%.
The partnership said it had created 4,400 net new jobs in the year, with a further 1,900 expected this year.

""We are in contact with her directly and will endeavour to reach a resolution,"" the theme park said in a statement.
Miss Pond was barred from the Smiler rollercoaster, the ride on which several people were seriously injured last year.
In a Facebook post, Miss Pond, 33, from Shrewsbury, said she had been ""astonished"" to see a girl with her arm in a plaster cast allowed on to the ride.
She wrote: ""I read the rules of the ride. You need to be able to walk 25m without help. And climb a ladder. Well I can assure you I can, nothing is wrong with my legs!""
She added: ""I'm still angry and upset. Never in my 33 years of life have I been treated with such discrimination over being born without my hand.
""I am not registered disabled as I'm too able bodied and for that reason can't claim any benefits.""
A spokeswoman for the theme park said: ""On arrival at the ride entrance, our staff did advise that for safety reasons, she would not be eligible to ride the Smiler.
""We aim to ensure that disabled guests are treated with respect and in a manner that is appropriate to their needs, whilst maintaining equality for all of our visitors.""

"But the World Health Organization says all the cases can be traced to the south-east of Guinea, where the outbreak began, and it should not be considered an epidemic.
BBC correspondents in the region explain the effects of the outbreak of the virus, which kills between 25% and 90% of its victims.
The traditional handshake is no longer a part of salutations in Guinea as people are now really terrified of being infected with Ebola.
An infected person, who may not show symptoms for up to 21 days, can pass on the disease through direct contact.
""I no longer go out of the house just so that I do not have cause to shake people's hands,"" Mohamed Barry, a 65-year-old retired civil servant, said.
The outbreak originated in the southern Forest Region where Geuckedou is thought to be the hardest hit town with more than half of the cases of infection and deaths.
Bats, a local delicacy in the south, are thought be carriers of the virus. Their sale and consumption has been banned by the health ministry along with other bushmeat.
Many health workers - including at least three doctors - were amongst the first victims.
""Most doctors at first treated the infected patients for malaria - hence medical staff treating these patients also got infected,"" Dr Sakoba Keita, from the health ministry, said.
The capital, Conakry, is the latest place to be hit, with one reported death - but it is here that the situation is most worrying as two million people live in in the city.
The disease has no known cure and no vaccine, so the main advice to people from health officials is to keep one's environment clean and wash hands regularly.
All homes now have bowls or buckets filled with disinfectant at their entrance for both inhabitants and visitors to wash their hands.
The outbreak is also affecting business. Senegal, for example, has closed its land borders with Guinea until further notice, and hundreds of people and their merchandise are stranded in vehicles on the Guinean side.
""Our goods are about to perish,"" one businessman told a local radio station on Tuesday.
The border is one of Guinea's busiest when it comes to cross-border trade - it shares borders with six countries in total.
Some flights have been affected as well: Air Mauritania has refused to fly Guinean passengers in transit in Dakar to Conakry on the grounds of the Ebola outbreak.
The large number of international medical experts from across the world who are now on the ground are giving people some assurance that the disease will be contained.
But funeral corteges are also getting smaller and smaller as a result of a fear of infection by someone who has had contact with a corpse.
""I don't go to any funeral now whether it is an Ebola-related death or not or whether it is my relation that has died or not,"" says schoolteacher Mariam Mansare.
When fears about Ebola first started last week, people dismissed it as a way for health officials to solicit funds in the name of a threat. It was not taken at all seriously.
However with the disclosure that four people have died in Liberia, it is now a subject of public discussion in teashops and marketplaces, as well as in the media.
The health ministry has issued guidelines, which include washing hands with soap as often as possible in a day and avoiding fast food bought on the streets.
Some shopping centres in the capital, Monrovia, have made it compulsory for the supermarket employees to wear gloves.
Schools initially closed, but have been ordered to reopen so as not to cause panic.
Liberia's Health Minister Walter Gwenigale raised a laugh on Monday at a press conference when he warned people to stop having sex because the virus was spread via bodily fluids.
""I see some people smiling but we have to tell you all the facts so that you don't get contaminated,"" he said.
But news of the Ebola outbreak has not yet affected night life in the capital, as the city's clubs remain open till dawn.
Ebola is obviously part of people's conversations but there has not been a change in people's behaviour, perhaps as there have been no report of cases here.
Of course, the government has communicated over the issue and over the weekend it displayed special medical suits that health workers would have to use to handle any suspected case.
Weekly markets near Guinea's border have been suspended to prevent the spread of the disease, and  the border has been shut.
In most countries of the region, like in Ivory Coast, the government has advised people not to consume bush meat but it is not been banned and I am told that you can still see it on sale on the side of the road outside the main city Abidjan.
In Sierra Leone, where there are five suspected cases of Ebola, travel restrictions are in place. Travellers have to fill out a questionnaire and indicate if they have suffered from a fever, vomiting or diarrhoea in the last two weeks.
The authorities have also banned relatives from bringing corpses into Sierra Leone from Guinea for burial.","An Ebola outbreak which is so far suspected of killing at least 83 people in Guinea has spread to Liberia, sparking concerns it could spread further afield in West Africa."
"The alleged victim, now in his 40s, was under 16 when he was at Grafton Close Children's Home, during the 1980s.
The man told the jury at Southwark Crown Court how Father Anthony McSweeney performed a sex act on him and then took out a camera.
Fr McSweeney, 68, of Pease Pottage, West Sussex, denies abusing boys at the home in Hounslow, west London.
The priest, of Old Brighton Road North, denies four counts of indecent assault, three counts of making indecent images of a child and one of taking indecent images of a child.
The alleged victim told the court the incident took place in a flat at Grafton Close belonging to John Stingemore.
The jury has been told that he abused boys during his time as the home's manager. He was due to be tried alongside Fr McSweeney but was found dead in his home last month.
When the alleged victim was asked why he did not tell anyone at the time what had happened, he replied: ""Who would I tell? There was no-one else other than the staff.
""It would only get reported to Mr Stingemore.
""I felt a bit ashamed as well.""
The alleged victim also described how the priest fondled him over his clothes as he sat on his lap while playing video games, and offered to help him wash as he was having a bath.

"Fish oil has been marketed to women as a prenatal supplement.
But a 10-year study of more than 2,500 pregnant women found it did not improve babies' intelligence, according to the Australian research.
The findings suggested that fish oil might lead to slightly longer pregnancies, but that would require further research, the team said.
""If a pregnant woman has a healthy, balanced diet, then the baby's brain development is not going to benefit from having these fish oil supplements,"" study co-author Dr Jacqueline Gould told the BBC.
The research, by the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute, followed women from their pregnancy to when their children were seven years old.
Participants were given either a daily fish oil supplement or a placebo.
The results found taking a 800mg dose of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 acid, had no impact on babies' intelligence.
Dr Gould said supplement makers had specifically marketed fish oil as a way to boost development in infants.
She said the research, detailed in the Journal of the American Medical Association, showed fish oil might be linked with longer pregnancies.
""What that meant was, there were slightly fewer children born pre-term,"" Dr Gould said.
""We're currently trying to validate that in a much bigger study.""","Taking fish oil while pregnant does not improve the brain development of babies, new research has found."
"The Gobbins is a dramatic cliff face walk in Islandmagee, County Antrim.

"Lord Janner died at the end of last year, shortly after a judge had ruled that the he was not fit to stand trial for alleged child sex offences.
But a leading lawyer has told the BBC he sees ""a danger"" that the inquiry into Lord Janner's case may contravene the principles of a fair trial.
As part of her wider inquiry, Dame Lowell, who served as a judge in her native New Zealand, will investigate the way public bodies handled child sex abuse claims.
She will be holding further preliminary hearings this month into allegations of child sexual abuse involving the Anglican Church, Lambeth Council and a number of institutions in Rochdale.
The inquiry will consider the prevalence of abuse and the adequacy of child protection policies.
At this stage, though, it will not hear from witnesses.
Instead, Dame Lowell has designated 17 complainants in the case as core participants, giving them access to relevant evidence and the opportunity to make opening and closing statements.
Core participants will be able to ask for particular questions to be put to witnesses by the inquiry panel but they will not be allowed to question the witnesses directly.
In setting out the scope of the investigation, Dame Lowell says she will consider whether or not the allegations against Lord Janner are ""well-founded"".
It is only if particular allegations meet this test that she will go on to consider whether the various authorities concerned had failed in their responsibilities.
This suggests that she intends to hold what amounts to a trial without a defendant.
Last April, her team said: ""If the evidence permits findings of fact to be reached concerning the allegations against Lord Janner, the inquiry will record and publish these findings.""
If Lord Janner's criminal trial had gone ahead, prosecutors would have had to prove the allegations against him beyond reasonable doubt.
However, it is thought that the Goddard inquiry will regard the allegations as well-founded if they can be proved on the balance of probabilities - the lesser standard of proof required in civil claims.
Another question for the inquiry is whether witnesses who claim they were abused by Lord Janner should be cross-examined, as they would have been at a criminal trial.
Unless lawyers for the various core participants are willing to challenge the evidence given by individual witnesses, Dame Lowell may have to consider appointing independent lawyers for the purpose.
That's because the inquiry's findings may have a bearing on civil claims being made against the estate of Lord Janner and against the various public bodies that are accused of failing in their safeguarding duties.
Prof Sir Ian Kennedy QC, who chaired the public inquiry into child deaths at Bristol Royal Infirmary which reported in 2001, said there was a danger that Lord Janner's case would become something like a trial.
In an interview for BBC Radio 4's Law in Action he said: ""The difficulty is that it can't really be a trial, as we would recognise it, because the person who is centre stage is no longer there.
""And that will pose very difficult questions about tackling the veracity or otherwise of witnesses.""
Sir Ian asked whether anyone would represent Lord Janner's interests at the inquiry.
He concluded: ""There is a danger, if you convert it into a trial, of it contravening some of the principles which we normally associate with a trial.""
Lord Janner's family have always denied the allegations against him.

It was named after the mix-up on this year's Celebrity Big Brother, when Angie Bowie informed Tiffany Pollard that David - meaning her ex-husband Bowie - had died during their time on the reality show. Pollard broke down in tears believing Gest, who was ill in bed at the time, had died.
Gest stayed in the Celebrity Big Brother house for 13 days but left the series on medical grounds.
In 2007 he was admitted to hospital with chest pains and respiratory problems.
One of the biggest successes during his career was producing the highest-rated special in US music history - 2001's Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration.
He was perhaps best known for his marriage to Minnelli. They were married in 2002 and officially divorced in 2007. He was also a childhood friend of Jackson and his brother Tito.
Gest's name-dropping anecdotes and raucous tales of showbiz friendships during his appearances on reality TV shows won him legions of fans in the UK.
He finished fourth in ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here in 2006, and later became a judge on talent show Grease Is The Word.
In 2011, Sir Cliff Richard worked with Gest on his album Soulicious.
Gest helped develop the concept of the album, which saw Sir Cliff collaborate with soul singers including Roberta Flack and Candi Staton. He later produced and directed the Soulicious tour.
Mr Handi, who confirmed the news of Gest's death, described him as a ""huge talent"".
""David was truly larger than life. He was not just a huge talent and a dear friend but a showbiz icon.
""I know he will be missed by millions of fans around the world, and particularly in Britain, who came to love his charm and blistering one-liners.""
A Metropolitan Police statement said: ""Police were called at 10:17 on Tuesday 12 April to the Four Seasons hotel, in Westferry Circus to reports of an unexplained death of a man in his 60s.
""London Ambulance Service were called to the scene. Life was pronounced extinct at the hotel. A post-mortem will be held in due course. Next of kin are in the process of being informed.""
Police have said there appear to be no suspicious circumstances.
Gest was born on May 11 1953 in Los Angeles, California. He worked as a music video and television producer and last year he toured the UK with David Gest's (I've Had) The Time Of My Life Tour - which played 14 cities.
He released an autobiography, titled Simply The Gest, in 2007.
Last month, Gest told the Hull Daily Mail: ""I don't live the showbusiness world in my private life.
""I don't go to many openings, or many premieres - that's not what I'm about, I did that more when I was younger.""
Gest's appearance often hit the headlines, and he said having cosmetic surgery was his ""biggest regret"".
For the last few years of his life Gest lived in York - shying away from his former lifestyle in LA.
He told the Yorkshire Post in 2014: ""It's my home and the most beautiful place in the world. You look at the Minster, the cobblestone streets, the history with the Vikings and the River Ouse running through.
""It also has the York Hog Roast. People come by and see me eating there and I tell them I'm having my turkey and my Yorkshire pudding, my stuffing, my crackling, my vegetables and my gravy and I'm loving every minute of it.""
Despite his celebrity credentials, Gest prided himself on being a man of the people, telling the newspaper: ""I don't look at celebrity the way others look at it.
""I'm down to earth. People come up to me in the streets in York and I talk with everybody. I don't believe there's really a difference between any of us.""
Gest married actress and singer Judy Garland's daughter Minnelli in 2002 in a star-studded wedding at New York's St Regis hotel.
The couple's 300 guests included Michael Jackson, Dame Joan Collins and Martine McCutcheon.
Jackson was the best man at the ceremony, arriving with matron of honour Elizabeth Taylor and Diana Ross.
His brothers Tito, Marlon, Randy and Jackie were among the groomsmen.
McCutcheon, together with actresses Mia Farrow and Janet Leigh and singer Petula Clark, was a bridesmaid at the ceremony.
Gest and Minnelli announced their separation a year later and divorced in 2007 when their lawyers filed court papers saying they had settled their differences and agreed to get divorced without fault.","Entertainer, producer and reality television star David Gest has died in a London hotel aged 62, a statement from his friend says."
"Eastmond, capped six times, previously played for St Helens and the England rugby league team before switching codes to join Bath in 2011.
The 27-year-old made 72 top-flight appearances for Bath, scoring 16 tries, including two last season.
""Kyle has already shown his international class and still has plenty of potential to fulfil,"" Wasps director of rugby Dai Young said.
Wasps have not disclosed the details of Eastmond's contract at the Ricoh Arena. He had agreed a new deal at Bath in January.
Eastmond, whose last international appearance for England came against South Africa in November 2014, becomes Wasps' 12th signing ahead of the 2016-17 season.

"Strauss, the England and Wales Cricket Board's director of cricket, told Pietersen in May that he would not be considered for an international recall.
""I think that clarity has helped,"" Strauss said.
England won the Ashes 3-2 but trail 2-0 in the one-day series before Tuesday's third ODI at Old Trafford (14:00 BST).
Pietersen, 35, who was initially sacked after the 5-0 whitewash in the 2013-14 Ashes series, remains England's record run-scorer in all formats.
But Strauss believes the team has ""moved on"".
He added: ""The danger at that time was that particular issue would overshadow everything that happened on the pitch over the course of the summer.
""What I was trying to do was provide clarity going forward so everyone knew where they stood.
""I think the team has moved on and the team is in a pretty good place. Some of those young guys have established themselves and that's what we will be focusing on taking England forward.""
England have called up wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow after deciding to rest Jos Buttler for the remaining three games of the ODI series.
Meanwhile, Australia could be forced into three changes after all-rounder Shane Watson, batsman David Warner and bowler Nathan Coulter-Nile were all ruled out of the rest of the series through injury.

"Many commentators condemn the police action against the Zaman newspaper and Samanyolu TV channel as a clampdown on press freedom. Both are described as being close to Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, the spiritual leader of the Hizmet movement, whom Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses of running a ""parallel state"". Pro-government newspapers, however, defend the authorities' action.
""Hitler also started like this,"" says opposition leftist daily Taraf. ""A strike against democracy,"" exclaims pro-Gulen newspaper Bugun.
""A raid meant to silence,"" declares Cumhuriyet. A commentary in the secular daily states that the administration led by President Erdogan ""doesn't like anything that is associated with freedom of the press"". ""It is indisputable that this operation is aimed at strengthening RTE's [Recep Tayyip Erdogan's] authoritarianism and dictatorship,"" says the article.
""Opposing the raid against Zaman and Samanyolu TV and the detentions does not mean defending their [the Gulen community's] opinions, beliefs and activities. What is at stake here is the freedom of press,"" argues centre-left daily Radikal.
Zaman, the moderate, pro-Islamic and pro-Gulen daily whose editor in-chief Ekrem Dumanli was detained by the police, has replaced its blue and white masthead with black lettering. ""Dark day for democracy,"" says the paper's headline.
Zaman also runs an article by Mr Dumanli in which he condemns those ""who want to turn the country into a spy state and a republic of fear, and want to govern it as if it was their own private fiefdom"". ""We have a duty to make sure this won't be the case,"" writes the arrested journalist.
Turkish TV also aired criticism of the arrests. Privately-owned NTV and CNN-Turk showed footage of protesters in front of Zaman's headquarters in Istanbul, holding posters saying, ''We all need free press'' and ''Free media cannot be silenced.""
CNN Turk and NTV broadcast critical statements from Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). He condemned the police action as a ""coup"". Mr Kilicdaroglu was also seen on state TRT Haber TV saying that ''if this country's media are not free, then the people will not be free either''.
Pro-government media have largely expressed strong support for the arrests.
All the participants in a studio discussion on pro-Erdogan Kanal 24 TV backed the actions of the authorities, with one of the guests warning that ""this is only the beginning"", and that new measures were imminent against a ""large gang'' made up of subversive elements in the police, the courts, the media and business circles.
""Those who see this as an issue of media freedom know pretty well where the real problem lies,"" argues pro-government Yeni Safak. The paper states that no journalist should use his position ""as a cover for other thingsâ€¦[to] turn journalism into a weapon and make it an extension of the struggle for power"".
Referring to last year's corruption allegations against Mr Erdogan, which he says were part of a plot to topple him, pro-government Sabah also points out that ""it is time for those who made hundreds of people suffer with fake evidence to account for what they did"".
Pro-government Star recalls President Erdogan's promise to end Mr Gulen's alleged ""parallel-state structure"" and his words that ""we will go into their caves"". ""Their caves have been entered,"" the daily says in a headline. The Star cautions Mr Erdogan's critics not to make hasty accusations, but rather to wait for the results of the investigation, which will reveal whether Zaman's editor-in-chief was really arrested for his journalistic activities.

"The merger would create the world's largest airline.
As part of the agreement, which must still be approved by a judge, the airlines will give up slots at several US airports.
The two companies argued the consolidation was necessary to their survival.
The US Justice Department had sued to stop the $11bn (Â£6.9bn) merger in August, arguing it would reduce competition and result in higher prices for consumers.
""This agreement has the potential to shift the landscape of the airline industry...[and] ensures airline passengers will see more competition on nonstop and connecting routes throughout the country,"" said Attorney General Eric Holder in a statement.
The two airlines will each give up 57 slots to low-cost carrier airlines at Ronald Reagan International Airport in Washington DC and 34 slots at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City.
The companies say this will result in 44 fewer daily departures at Reagan and 12 fewer daily departures at LGA - a fraction of the close to 400 daily flights that the airlines operate from those two airports.
""They dominated Reagan Airport, that's why they had the Department of Justice concerned,"" Ray Neidl, an airline analyst at Nexa Capital, told the BBC, who said that giving up slots at the airport was an unsurprising part of the agreement.
""It was better than litigating,"" he added.
An additional two slots each at Boston Logan International, Chicago O'Hare International, Dallas Love Field, Los Angeles International and Miami International airports will be released.
The slots will be given to low cost airlines like JetBlue and Southwest.
""This agreement allows us to take the final steps in creating the new American Airlines,"" said Tom Horton, head of American Airline's parent corporation, AMR, in a statement.
The company now says it expects the merger to be finalised in December 2013.
AMR Corp has been in a bankruptcy restructuring for two years and it is hoped that once the merger is finalised, the company will be able to complete its turnaround.

The campaign group said PCCs were ""serial offenders"" in using ""jargon"".
Adam Simmonds, PCC, said: ""The best communicators talk to people using the type of language they understand.""
The existing chief constable, Adrian Lee, will be leaving the force in July.
The candidate information pack said the force was looking for an ""agent of change"" who can get ""client-side"" and ""is a pioneer in blue-light collaboration"".
Steve Jenner, spokesman for the Plain English Campaign, said: ""The sentence that 'our chief constable must be able to see beyond the horizons of convention to make the paradigm shift' is a prime example of 'ploddledegook'.
""Police and crime commissioners seem to be repeat offenders in this regard for their mangling of the English language and this advert is borderline criminal.
""Senior police officers are probably used to this kind of jargon so they will understand it but the danger is they use it when they talk to the public.""

"Southgate was delighted with aspects of England's display in defeat in the friendly against Germany in Dortmund on Wednesday while the unspectacular win against Lithuania was all about getting three more points towards World Cup qualification.
So what will Southgate take away from the last week as England look ahead to their next qualifier in Scotland on 10 June?
Southgate set the normal rules about strikers and age aside to bring 34-year-old Jermain Defoe back into the England fold four years after his last goal for his country, scored in a victory against San Marino.
Injuries to main striker Harry Kane and all-time record goalscorer Wayne Rooney forced Southgate's hand but he was able to call on the hard evidence provided by Defoe's 14 Premier League goals in a Sunderland side renowned for not making chances and rooted to the bottom of the table.
Defoe has always traded in the game's most important currency, goals, throughout his lengthy career. This was a performance designed to demonstrate to doubters and Southgate he has not outlived his usefulness at international level.
He was sharp and saw one chance saved before he demonstrated his poacher's instinct in the penalty area to slide in Adam Lallana's pass in the 21st minute before flashing another shot narrowly off target.
In many respects he is an old-fashioned attacking operator in that his first thought is always the back of the net and shooting at it. No extra touches or passes are required. Defoe had two shots on target, one off target and one blocked with very limited opportunities - but most significantly made England's breakthrough.
He is selfish in just the right way and in a World Cup qualifying group where England will be confronted by the sort of mass defence Lithuania presented here, it is unlikely this will be a temporary return to the colours.
Dele Alli was given heavy-handed - or more precisely heavy-footed - treatment from Lithuania as they tried to light the short fuse that has brought Tottenham's 20-year-old some unsavoury headlines in his short career.
It meant Alli was nowhere near as influential as he was in Dortmund on Wednesday, where his efforts will have imprinted his importance for both the present and the future in Southgate's mind.
With Alli subdued, this was the chance for Liverpool's Adam Lallana to step forward and confirm his progression into a fully-fledged first-choice member of this England side.
The 28-year-old is a late developer for England but his rejuvenation under Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool is now reaping dividends for Southgate as a very important spin-off.
Lallana has been directly involved in four goals in his last five England appearances, three goals and one assist, and was unlucky to strike the post in Germany.
He combined natural energy and creation with subtlety at Wembley, the qualities needed to make a difference in an attacking framework with England - with his beautiful, imaginative touch inside a crowded penalty the perfect invitation for Jamie Vardy to make the game safe against Lithuania.
If his Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson and Tottenham's Eric Dier can provide a solid midfield shield for England's defence and freedom for those further forward, Southgate will hope Alli and Lallana will flourish even more on the road to Russia.
Jermain Defoe showed exactly what a natural goalscorer can bring to England - which is why Southgate will want Tottenham's Harry Kane restored to full fitness as soon as possible.
England have players who can score goals, as Vardy also proved, with Wayne Rooney not willing to take a back seat yet and youngsters such as Marcus Rashford ready to stake their claim.
But Kane, still only 23 and with 19 goals and four assists for Spurs in the Premier League this season, is the class act Southgate will want fully recovered from his ankle injury to spearhead England through the rest of the campaign.
Kane, and he was not alone here, endured a miserable Euro 2016 perhaps memorable only for then manager Roy Hodgson's puzzling decision to put a proven goalscorer (and a tall proven goalscorer at that) on corner-taking duty.
He has endured a dry spell with England, with five goals in 17 appearances, but his performances at club level this season have shown further maturity and he has the sort of mature and measured personality that could yet mark him out as a future England captain.
Kane is currently recovering from ankle ligament damage and is weeks away from full fitness - but in the long-term he will be a centrepiece of Southgate's plans as the man to take the opportunities England missed in Germany and against Lithuania.
Burnley's Michael Keane has been the beneficiary of Gareth Southgate's willingness to move outside the Premier League elite with his selection policy and the opportunities that can suddenly present themselves at international level.
Keane moved up the England pecking order when Phil Jones hurt his toe in collision with Manchester United team-mate Chris Smalling and had to withdraw from the squad before the Germany game - and got another chance following his fine debut with Gary Cahill suspended and Smalling an injury casualty for the Lithuania qualifer.
The 24-year-old slotted in perfectly to a three-man defence alongside Smalling and Cahill in Germany and was an able partner to John Stones against Lithuania, although the lack of serious attacking threat from England's opposition in Sunday's game must be used as context.
Keane has, however, given the impressive initial impression that he has the composure and concentration for international football and has been one of the major positives for Southgate and England this week.

Once again England's route to a major tournament does not seem to have an obstacle in sight - a familiar journey to what might prove to be a dangerous final destination.
England and Southgate have no excuses for failing to progress to Russia from a group containing Slovakia, Slovenia, Scotland, Lithuania and Malta and all the evidence suggests it will be as straightforward as expected.
It was the same under former manager Roy Hodgson and England's untroubled qualifying campaign for Euro 2016, which brought an unblemished 10 wins out of 10 against Switzerland, Slovenia, Estonia, Lithuania and San Marino.
England set off for France with optimism but only recorded one win against Wales before the embarrassing exit against Iceland in the last 16.
The conundrum for Southgate is that the true measure of England's progress and test of how far they have come under his tutelage may only be revealed when they are faced with a higher-class of opposition in a competitive environment.
One of Southgate's major tasks between now and what looks like certain qualification for the 2018 World Cup in Russia is to find a way of discovering just how good this England team is - and how to uncover any flaws before the serious business begins.",Gareth Southgate will feel a sense of cautious optimism after his first two matches as permanent England manager in succession to Sam Allardyce - but some familiar questions remain.

The 50-year-old Portuguese, who first managed the Blues between 2004 and 2007, was officially announced as Chelsea's new boss on 3 June.
""I am the Happy One,"" said Mourinho at a Stamford Bridge news conference.
Career record up to 1 June 2013
""Calmer? I believe so. I'm in the best moment of my career in terms of knowledge.""
He added: ""I began management in 2000. I thought I knew everything, but after 13 years you realise you know nothing and have to learn every day. My adventures around Europe were fantastic for me, different countries, different cultures, different media. It was fantastic.
""At 50, I think I am still very young as a manager and I think it is like the beginning of a new period. Do I have a different personality? No, but for sure I have a different approach and perspective.""
Former Real Madrid boss Mourinho, who replaces Rafael Benitez at Stamford Bridge, has signed a four-year deal and said he wants to stay for the entire term.
""I hope I can go to the last day of the contract. If the club is happy and the club wants me to stay then I'll be more than happy to stay.""
When asked whether he was disappointed that neither Manchester United nor Manchester City had approached him about their managerial vacancies, he said: ""I am where I want to be - I wouldn't change it for anything.""
The former Porto and Inter Milan boss helped Chelsea win five major trophies during his first spell at the club - two Premier League titles, two League Cups and an FA Cup. He believes he can emulate that achievement.
""I want to believe it is possible - I always trust my work,"" added Mourinho.
""I know many people who belong to the club and I know the type of mentality and ambition people have.
""My career has been built and raised on success. I was able to achieve success and win trophies and leave different types of legacies at every club. I have to believe in that.""
When Mourinho left the Blues in 2007 it came as a surprise to many, although it was widely reported that his relationship with owner Roman Abramovich had become strained.
But the Portuguese boss stressed on Monday: ""That is not true.
""I read and keep reading that I was fired and we had a complete breakdown in relationship. At the time we thought it was the best for both of us [to go our separate ways].
""Jose Mourinho produced none of the fireworks that marked his first arrival at Stamford Bridge. This was a studied Mourinho, a mature Mourinho, a Mourinho intent on hammering home that this was an older, wiser manager.
""And he was at pains to stress how happy he was to be back. So happy he repeated it countless times, although his subdued manner did not exude joy.
""Mourinho, the master controller, perhaps knew the media expected an equally spectacular performance on his second coming. And he was determined to give us what he wanted rather than what we expected.
""This may change, of course, when the first ball is kicked.""
""It was a decision that was difficult for both of us, but a decision made by mutual agreement. There was never a breakdown of the relationship and that is why it is possible for me to be here today.
""I am back because we feel we are in the best moments of our careers, ready to work together again and in much better conditions this time to succeed in what this club wants, which is stability.""
Mourinho also stated he wants to make defender John Terry ""the best player he can be"" again.
The 32-year-old, who was made club captain by Mourinho during his first spell in charge, missed much of last season because of injury and suspension.
Even when Terry was available he was often overlooked by Benitez.
""I won't speak one word about Rafael Benitez's decisions, either on John Terry or any other player,"" said Mourinho.
""All I can speak about is the future and the future is to meet John on 1 July and try to get the best out of him. I know what he can give, so let's try to make him again the best player he can be.""
However, Mourinho insists there will be ""no privilege"" for his former players, saying: ""There are still a few boys from my time but it's important to tell you - not them because they know - that there is no privilege for them. They know my nature. They don't have an advantage in relation to other people.""
And he has warned Chelsea fans not to expect several new signings: ""We have 60 players I think because there are 20 new buys in the media in the last two days. No - I need to work with the players, not commit injustice, give them a chance, be fair with them.
""After that we'll have time to make decisions. A couple of signings is normal, correct practice in every club, but I want to see the players I have.""
Mourinho arrives at Chelsea after a turbulent three-year term at Real Madrid, where it was reported that he fell out with some players, notably goalkeeper Iker Casillas, and irritated the media by not appearing at news conferences.
However, he gave a caustic response when reminded of Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta's suggestion that he ""damaged"" Spanish football.
""I damaged Spanish football by being the manager that broke Barcelona dominance.
""They were dominant and dominant and dominant and it looked like it was a dominance without an end.
""Real Madrid won the cup final against Barcelona, Real Madrid won the Super Cup against Barcelona, Real Madrid won in Barcelona and Real Madrid won the championship, which is the historical [2011-12] championship of 100 points and 121 goals.""
Before moving to the Bernabeu, Mourinho won the Champions League and Italian league title at Inter Milan.

"30 October 2013 Last updated at 17:10 GMT
Last month, the government made changes so head teachers can no longer allow absence outside school holidays, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
It's because of concerns that some kids were missing school for family holidays during term time when it's cheaper.
But more than 125,000 people disagree, signing a petition against the move.
The petition says: ""All children who have a good attendance record should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy quality time with their parents on an annual holiday of up to 10 days once per year.""
But the government says it's giving schools more freedom to set term dates - which could mean parents could book cheaper holidays.
Ricky's got the story.",Your next holiday might seem like a long way off but there's a row brewing about when schoolkids in England should be able to take them.
"In the scripted video, the actors describe Australia as a ""wonderful island"" and warn others to respect its laws.
The video was submitted to the court as Ms Heard escaped conviction for failing to declare the couple's dogs Pistol and Boo when visiting Mr Depp in Queensland in a private jet in May.
Reaction on social media was swift and brutal, with many comparing the short film to Chinese or North Korean-style propaganda. Viewers were divided over Mr Depp's somewhat lacklustre performance.
""I've seen IS (so-called Islamic State) hostage videos with more joie de vivre than Johnny Depp's apology,"" said one Twitter user.
Others suggested sarcastically that the low-budget feature was his finest and most innovative role in years.
Some tried to imagine the scene behind the camera.
The video was shot on Australia's Gold Coast on Sunday and played during the hearing at Southport Magistrate's Court.
It begins with Ms Heard describing Australia as a ""wonderful place with a treasure trove of unique plants, animals and people"".
Johnny Depp continues: ""Australians are just as unique, both warm and direct. When you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly.""
This was widely seen as a reference to Barnaby Joyce, who as agriculture minister had originally threatened to have Pistol and Boo put down if they didn't ""bugger off"" back to the United States.
Mr Joyce, who is now deputy prime minister, acknowledged that the video may not have been entirely natural. ""I don't think it would be something they would have willingly wanted to do,"" he said.
People have poked fun at the case since it began last year, using the hashtags #WarOnTerrier and #Terriergate.
It is not clear whose idea the video was, but reports said Australian prosecutors had vetted the dialogue.
Ms Heard pleaded guilty to falsifying an immigration document. The more serious charges of illegally importing animals were dropped.
The judge in the case placed Ms Heard on a A$1,000 ($770; Â£540) good behaviour bond on Monday. No conviction was recorded against her.","Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have released a stilted apology video for breaking Australia's strict biosecurity laws, bringing a bizarre end to the so-called ""war on terrier""."
"Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair, said it was ""fair"" that self-employed people paid more tax.
But there still needed to be a ""small differential"" as there were differences in rights over issues such as pensions and parental leave.
That would rule out further National Insurance rises for the self-employed.
Mr Taylor also said it was likely there would be reform of employment laws to change the way companies such as Deliveroo and Uber, which use self-employed workers, operate.
What the Budget means for you
At a glance - Budget key points
Think tank backs National Insurance rise
""Tax rises are never popular, but as tax rises go, this is pretty fair,"" Mr Taylor told me.
""It's economically rational and it strengthens the long term resilience of the tax base.
""So if you are going to raise taxes, it is a pretty good way to do it.""
""The government has left a small differential so that employed people will pay 12% of their salary in National Insurance, self-employed 11%,"" said Mr Taylor, who is also the chief executive of the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce.
""That recognises that there is still [a] small difference in entitlements - that seems to be pretty fair - I don't think there needs to be more reform in that area.""
The Chancellor is facing controversy after he announced that the National Insurance rate for the self-employed would increase by 1% next year and 1% in 2019.
That will raise about Â£2bn more for the government by 2022.
The move has been attacked for penalising entrepreneurs who have set up their own businesses.
But Mr Taylor said it was right that the self-employed chose that route because it gave them autonomy rather than tax advantages.
He also said that the self-employed would be helped by the abolition of what is called National Insurance Contributions 2, which was announced in 2016.
""Self-employment is great and most people who choose it, choose it because it gives them flexibility - not because it gives them tax benefits,"" he said.
""There is an outdated element to our system - which is where people who are self-employed pay lower national insurance contributions because they get fewer benefits,"" he said.
""But last year the government said that self-employed people would get access to pensions and yesterday the Chancellor said they would get access to paid parental leave.
""That means there is virtually no difference in the entitlements that employed people have and self-employed people have.
""This gap [in tax] is no longer rational; it no longer serves a purpose.""
Mr Taylor said he understood why the government had not tackled firms who have been criticised for gaining a tax advantage by using self-employed people.
Companies that use self-employed workers, such as Deliveroo and Uber, do not pay National Insurance contributions for their employees or pension contributions.
Mr Taylor said it was likely that there would have to be reform.
""Over the medium to long term we shouldn't be taxing employment, we should be taxing labour,"" he said.
""It shouldn't really matter what form of employment you've got, if we're going to tax work, let's tax it reasonable consistently.
""But that is a long difficult journey to go on.
""I think that what should drive business models is the pursuit of innovation, productivity, high quality customer service - not trying to avoid the tax system, not trying to avoid employment responsibilities.
""Over the long term I would like to see a more level playing field so businesses are competing on how good they are as businesses, not how clever they are at avoiding tax.""
Mr Taylor's government review of working practices and rights at work will be published in the summer.",The man reviewing the new world of work for Number 10 has told the BBC that controversial tax increases for the self-employed go far enough.
"The framework agreement, struck after intensive talks, aims to prevent Tehran making a nuclear weapon in exchange for phased sanction relief.
Iran and the six world powers involved must now finalise the deal.
Iranians have been celebrating in the streets but Israel says the deal threatens its survival.
""This will be a long-term deal, that addresses each path to a potential Iranian nuclear bomb,"" the US President said in a statement after the deal was announced.
""If Iran cheats, the world will know it,"" he said, adding that the agreement was based not on trust but on ""unprecedented verification"". He said that if the deal is finalised, ""we will be able to resolve one of the greatest threats to our security, and to do so peacefully"".
According to ""parameters"" of the agreement published by the US state department, Iran must reduce the number of its centrifuges that can be used to enrich uranium into a bomb by more than two-thirds.
It also has to redesign a power plant so it cannot produce weapons-grade plutonium, be subject to regular inspections, and agree not to enrich uranium over 3.67% - far less than is required to make a nuclear bomb - for at least 15 years.
""There's new state of the art technology that will be used,"" US Secretary of State John Kerry told the BBC. ""We will have tracking of their uranium from the cradle to the grave.""
There's been celebration through the night across Iran and a hero's welcome for Foreign Minister Javad Zarif. But the deal he's brought home has been dismissed by hardliners who say Iran surrendered too much in exchange for too little.
John Kerry also faces a mix of support and scepticism in the US Congress. The loudest condemnation has come from Israel's Prime Minister Netanyahu, who insists this deal doesn't block but helps Iran build a nuclear bomb.
As hard as it was to reach this preliminary agreement, it will be even harder to draft a final deal by the end of June. But, if negotiators do it, it will be a victory for diplomacy which, they believe will make the world a much safer place.
A deal that buys time
The framework agreement was announced by the European Union and Iran after eight days of intense negotiations in the Swiss city of Lausanne.
Western powers have long distrusted Iran's assertions that its nuclear programme is peaceful.
The talks at Lausanne's Beau-Rivage Palace hotel between Iran and the so-called P5+1 - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany - continued beyond the original, self-imposed deadline of 31 March.
The Iranian foreign minister, Javid Zarif, called it a ""win-win outcome"", but warned: ""We have taken a major step, but are still some way away from where we want to be.""
The parties have set a deadline of 30 June to reach a comprehensive pact, but these negotiations are expected to be tougher than those that led to the framework agreement.
Even so, there was jubilation overnight on the streets of Tehran.
If the deal is implemented it should mean the eventual lifting of sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.
Unusually, the US President's speech was aired live on Iranian state television, with some Iranians taking ""selfies"" with Mr Obama as a backdrop.
There was anger though from Israel, whose leader Benjamin Netanyahu has been a vocal critic of Iran and told President Obama the deal threatened the survival of Israel.
The Israeli prime minister said it would ""increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war"", according to his spokesman.
In the US, the deal has been criticised by members of Congress who want US lawmakers to have the right to review any final agreement.
US House Speaker John Boehner said the deal represented an ""alarming departure"" from Mr Obama's original goals and that Congress should review the deal before sanctions on Iran were lifted.","President Obama has hailed a deal restricting Iran's nuclear programme as a ""historic understanding"" which, if implemented, will make world safer."

Some critics of petitions suggest they are in danger of becoming symbols of protest rather than effective instruments of change.
Stephen Coleman, professor of political communication at the University of Leeds, said: ""We should be very concerned about how representative these petitions are.
""If they are only empowering the usual people who vote and participate in other ways, they will exacerbate the gap between the political efficacy of the already active and the limited influence of the least confident.""
But Darren Hughes, deputy chief executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said petitions were an effective way of engaging with people who would not normally be interested in politics.
""The more ways to engage the better, and while there always going to be places that sign petitions more than others, that's normal, and millions of people are using this tool right across the county,"" he said.
""What would be a positive change would be for these petitions to encourage some further engagement - if the site asked them to register to vote, get more involved in politics, and follow more closely the work of Parliament.""
We focussed on the top ten most popular petitions.
The same 17 constituencies were in the top 10% of signatures in six of the most popular petitions since Parliament launched a website in July 2015.
Where they were not in the top 10, it was mainly because the other petitions were calling for the opposite of the other petitions they had signed.
For the most popular Parliament petition of all time, calling for a second referendum on leaving the European Union, 17 of the 65 constituencies that signed it the most were also in the top 10% for:

"""No matter what I did, I always felt I was fighting a losing battle,"" he said.
But Burgess said he had not been badly treated by England and refused to blame coach Stuart Lancaster.
The 26-year-old, who joined Bath last October, re-signed for the South Sydney Rabbitohs last week.
He was part of England's squad for the Rugby World Cup, in which they were eliminated at the group stage, and played in the hosts' crucial 28-25 defeat by Wales.
Burgess said criticism directed at him following his performance in that match had contributed to his feeling of unease in rugby union.
""A lot of people outside the England camp had an agenda against both England and, in some circumstances, me,"" he wrote in the Daily Mail.
""This was an upsetting factor to me, that people who are supposed to love the game are actually tearing it to shreds.
""Some ex-players just kept letting rip. It's almost like they don't want anyone else to do well in the jersey. I didn't want to stay in a sport like that.""
Burgess also said he had not found the 15-man code as enjoyable as rugby league.
""I want to spend the rest of my career playing the game that's in my heart,"" said Burgess, who played 21 games for Bath as a blind-side flanker after switching codes last year.
""What makes me love [rugby league] is the physical battle of it; I never found myself reaching that point [in union].
""My heart just isn't in [rugby union], and if my heart's not in it then [Bath and England] won't get the best performances from me.""
He said he was satisfied with his displays at the World Cup and believed coach Lancaster had been unfairly criticised after the team's early exit.
Burgess, whose selection for the World Cup squad ahead of the established Luther Burrell reportedly caused disquiet in the England camp, said his decision to quit union had dismayed his international and club team-mates.
""I wanted to go in and see [the Bath squad], but Stuart Hooper, our captain, said he didn't think I'd be well received there, which was fair enough,"" he said.","Former England centre Sam Burgess returned to rugby league because his ""heart wasn't in"" rugby union and because he was also stung by criticism from ex-players."

"The 71-year-old will join John Lally and her beloved old pony Super Sam in a picturesque woodland spot in Cornwall, south west England.
Also already buried in the family plot are Blot the cat, Muppet the Alsatian dog, and Brian the canary.
Elsewhere in the six acres (2.4 hectares) of woods and fields, some 40 other people are also laid to rest with their pets.
The land is owned by Ms Lally's business, Penwith Pet Crematorium, which is one of 50 or so pet crematoriums and cemeteries across the UK.
And businesses is booming, as an ever-growing number of pet owners wish to give their animals a more formal send-off.
At Penwith they now individually cremate an average of 200 animals per week, double the number a decade ago. Prices range from £42 for a hamster or guinea pig, up to £187 for a large dog.
Meanwhile, it costs £900 to bury a horse (they are too big to be cremated at Penwith), or £1,500 for a human being.
Ms Lally says: ""It was my silly idea to set up the business back in 1988.""
She adds that she came up with the idea when she realised that there were many people like her and her husband who would like give their pets a formal cremation or burial. And that others would, like them, also consider being ultimately buried beside their pets, or where their beloved animals' ashes were scattered or interred.
""My husband and I were running a farm, and we were lucky enough to have the land to set up the business,"" says Ms Lally.
""So we set aside six acres. The business then gradually grew from there thanks to positive word of mouth and repeat business.
""Everyone who comes here goes away and happily recommends us to other people, and we get people who come back with their second and third pets.""
Far from being just a British phenomenon, the industry of pet cremation and burial, or ""pet loss"" as it is known, is now a very big business globally.
According to US-based trade body Pet Loss Professionals Alliance (PLPA), the average annual turnover of its members around the world in 2013 was $860,464 (£556,000).
And that year its members in the US alone cremated 1.46 million pets.
Coleen Ellis, co-chair of the PLPA, opened the first stand-alone pet funeral home in the US.
Today, she owns and runs an organisation called Two Hearts Pet Loss, which educates veterinary professionals and pet loss businesses about how best to meet the needs of people whose pets nearing the end of their lives.
Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, Ms Ellis, who is also the author of a book on the subject, says it is important to remember that there are two types people who have pets - ""pet owners"" and ""pet parents"".
She adds: ""My services are geared towards the pet parent, the person who saw their little furry animal as a member of the family.
""I wanted to give people 'permission' to do what they wanted to do to honour their pet, and to honour the life they shared together.
""We are giving them permission to do more, and possibly in an area where they may be felt like they were going to be shamed, or made fun of, because a lot of people may be looking at them and saying 'it was just a dog', or 'it was just a cat, why do you want to do that, that's crazy?'.""
Vivianne Dhupa and her husband Sarit Dhupa decided to go into the pet loss industry after a traumatic experience following the death of their then 17-year-old cat in 2004.
Their cat died on route to their vets in San Diego, California, and the couple did not want to take its ashes back from the surgery.
A few months later Ms Dhupa went back to ask where the ashes had been scattered, only to be told that the cat had been taken to an animal rendering plant, because the couple hadn't specifically requested cremation.
""Needless to say, I was angry and devastated,"" says the 42-year-old.
To prevent other pet owners going through a similar experience, the couple set up their own pet crematorium - Peaceful Paws Pet Crematorium. This now cremates 20,000 pets per year, and customers can choose from a range of specially designed pet urns.
However, Ms Dhupa and her husband went one stage further, and also opened a hospice centre for dying pets, the Into The Sunset Pet Transition Centre.
Ms Dhupa says: ""While our primary goal is to ensure our patients are pain-free and maintaining an acceptable quality of life, we focus a great deal on supporting the family emotionally.
""We do not prolong life or hasten death. Our primary goal is quality of life until the family is ready for their final goodbye.""
Back in the UK, Carole Mundy, 61, has purchased burial plots at Penwith Pet Crematorium for her herself and her husband, and all of their cats and dogs. Plus three separate areas for her rescued horses. She says it has cost her thousands of pounds.
""I wanted to find a resting place where I can be buried with all of my animals,"" she says.
""They give me unconditional and devoted love, so why would I not want to be buried with them.""

"Deila's side host the team from his native Norway in a Europa League Group A match.
Celtic have two points from their opening three games, with Molde leading the section on seven having beaten the Scottish champions last month.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""It's an enormous game, a must-win match,"" Sutton, 42, told BBC Scotland.
""To have any chance of reaching the knockout stage they have to beat Molde and then Ajax at home in the next game.""
Sutton was asked what it would mean for Deila's future should Celtic not get their first win in the group.
""There would be questions asked if Celtic were outplayed and out-thought by Molde, but let's cross that bridge and wait for the game on Thursday,"" replied the Englishman.
Former Norwich City, Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea forward Sutton, who scored more than 60 goals in his six years at Celtic, expects Molde to travel to Glasgow with ""no fear"".
""Most people thought at the outset that Molde were the weakest team in the group,"" he said.
""I thought Fenerbahce, with all the money they've got, would be the strongest, but it hasn't proven to be that way.
""Molde have turned out to be the surprise package. They've got a game plan and an attacking threat.
""They sat in against Fenerbahce then hit them on the counter attack. Against Celtic, Celtic played well for 10 minutes then that was it. Molde will come to Glasgow with no fear.
""After beating Celtic, they've won two games domestically and they'll fancy it.
""But, from the Celtic point of view, the players have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Celtic should just go for it. They have to win.
""It's a game in which Celtic and Ronny Deila have to make a statement after a bitterly disappointing performance in Norway. Now they have the chance to put it right.
""To do that, first and foremost they have to keep a clean sheet, because there's goals in the team, with [Leigh] Griffiths, and now that [James] Forrest's back and [Kris] Commons is in there. [Jozo] Simunovic at the back should help too.""
Celtic's group campaign after they lost to Malmo in the Champions League play-off started with a 2-2 draw against Ajax - a match they finished with 10 men.
They led 2-0 against Fenerbahce in the second round of fixtures, but defensive errors allowed the Turkish side to fight back and claim a draw.
In Molde, defensive frailty was also apparent as Celtic went down 3-1,
""There's been some catastrophic individual errors throughout the European campaign and I understand that Ronnie has to back his players, but some of their individual decision-making has been poor and ultimately it's cost Celtic,"" Sutton said.
""They can't keep shipping goals - that's been the problem.""
Sutton, who played in Celtic's 2003 Uefa Cup final defeat by Porto, feels it's understandable for Deila and Celtic to be judged on their European performances.
""It happened in my time under Martin O'Neill - and to Gordon Strachan, to Neil Lennon,"" he recalled.
""Europe is an important part of this club and the fans have high expectations.
""It's not unreasonable for fans to expect Celtic to compete in a Europa League group, albeit a tough one.
""The bottom line is that Celtic responded extremely well to that defeat against Molde, beating Dundee United, winning a tricky League Cup tie against Hearts and beating Aberdeen well, but I think fans separate European from domestic football.
""That's just the way it is and this Celtic team need a big performance and a result on Thursday.''","Former striker Chris Sutton believes questions will most likely be asked over Ronny Deila's position if Celtic are ""outplayed and out-thought by Molde""."

He was referring to the fact that, despite limited powers, the president can sack governments and also swears in chancellors.
Mr Hofer countered that Mr Van der Bellen was the one who had refused to swear in a Freedom Party chancellor if the party won at the next general election in 2018.
However, the debate was said to be less feisty than last Sunday's TV encounter, described by some commentators as a slugfest.
In the first round of voting, Mr Hofer secured 35% of the votes, while Mr Van der Bellen, polled 21%.
For the first time since World War Two, the candidates from Austria's two main parties - the Social Democrats and the People's Party - did not make it to the run-off.
Both parties have governed Austria for decades - either alone or in coalition.
This is a big shake-up in Austrian politics, as the country has had a president from the centre-left or centre-right since 1945.
The victory in the first round of the far-right candidate reflects widespread discontent with the status quo, as well as concerns about immigration and the economy, correspondents say.
Support for the Social Democrats and the People's Party has been falling in recent years.
In the last general election in 2013, the two parties won just enough votes to govern in a ""grand coalition"".

"In a career spanning six decades, he released more than 70 albums and amassed nine Grammy awards.
His melodic songs found success in the pop charts with hits including Galveston, Rhinestone Cowboy and Wichita Lineman.
And he also made a foray into acting, notably alongside John Wayne in the film True Grit.
Glen Travis Campbell was born in Pike County, Arkansas, on 22 April 1936, the seventh of 12 children.
His father was a sharecropper, a tenant who paid his rent with a proportion of the crops that he grew.
His first guitar cost $7 from a Sears catalogue and he whiled away the time teaching himself to play.
""We didn't have power in the house, but we did have an old battery radio. And whenever I heard a new song, usually on a local country station, I'd learn it.""
His proficiency led to an offer to join a band fronted by his uncle, Dick Bills and the Sandia Mountain Boys. There were appearances on local radio and a spot on a children's TV channel.
Campbell moved to Los Angeles in 1960 and  became a member of a group of musicians named The Wrecking Crew, who backed artists such as Dean Martin, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra.
His first solo chart entry, Turn Round and Look at Me, reached 62 in the Billboard Hot 100 in 1961.
He also played a pivotal role in the producer Phil Spector's famous Wall of Sound technique.
""When I met Phil, he was knocked out by my playing,"" Campbell later recalled. ""He was like a child with a new toy.""
For three months in 1965 he toured with the Beach Boys, filling in for singer Brian Wilson, who had experienced a breakdown.
His big break came in 1967 with the Jimmy Webb song By the Time I Get to Phoenix, which reached number two in the US Country charts.
Campbell's partnership with Webb was to be a fruitful one, as hit followed hit. Wichita Lineman went to No 1 in the US and also broke him in Britain where it reached the Top 10 in 1968.
""Jimmy used to write in the studio as I was recording,"" said Campbell. ""When he sang me the parts of Wichita Lineman he'd written, I knew it was a hit.""
The song collected a Grammy and became much requested by US soldiers fighting in Vietnam.
He followed it up with Galveston a year later, which again charted on both sides of the Atlantic.
In January 1969 he started hosting his own primetime TV show, The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour.
The show, which ran for three years, made him a huge star and his fame encouraged a glittering roster of stars to appear with him.
Johnny Cash, Roger Miller, Willie Nelson and the Monkees were among the artists who were guests on the show.
He was also invited by John Wayne, a long time Campbell admirer, to appear in the Western True Grit. He won a Grammy for his performance of the film's title song.
His biggest hit came in 1975 with Rhinestone Cowboy, which reached the Top 10 in a number of countries, including the UK. It coincided with a series of shows on BBC television
There was another smash in 1977, - Southern Nights - but both his career and personal life began to slide. He divorced his second wife in 1975 but a subsequent marriage lasted just four years.
While country aficionados continued to buy his records, his mainstream audience had begun to desert him.
He turned to alcohol and drugs for solace. ""I was fine when I was doing session work. My schedule then would have killed a horse, so there was no time for drugs,"" he later said.
""But later on, I didn't have any stability. After a couple of failed marriages, it became a bit of a habit.""
His short but high profile relationship with 21-year-old country star Tanya Tucker, 25 years his junior, provided much fodder for the gossip magazines.
His salvation came when he met and married Kim Woolen in 1982 and turned to God.
""I got down on my knees and prayed. And, eventually, I got rid of those demons."" Apart from a brief lapse in 2003, when he was jailed for drink-driving, he stayed off the booze and the drugs.
In 2005 he was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. Throughout this period, he continued to play and record and released covers of songs by artists as diverse as U2 and Green Day.
In 2011 Campbell announced he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and set off on a farewell tour that included an emotional goodbye at the Grammy Awards in February 2012.
""I've accomplished everything I wanted to do,"" he said in a 2012 interview.  ""I've been blessed. When I think back to where I came from, I have been able to do some amazing things in my life. And music will always be part of my life.""",Glen Campbell was one of the most successful country singers of his generation.
"Michal Konrad Herba, 36, appeared in court for an extradition hearing following his arrest in Tividale, West Midlands, on Wednesday.
He is the brother of Lukasz Pawel Herba who is being held by Italian police over the alleged kidnap in Milan.
Michal Herba denies involvement. The case was adjourned until 25 September.
Prosecutor Florence Iveson told the court that he was suspected of kidnapping and unlawfully detaining Ms Ayling in a ""joint enterprise"" with his brother and other ""unidentified persons"".
The 20-year-old model was allegedly drugged and a ransom of â‚¬300,000 (Â£270,000) was demanded, the court heard.
Defence lawyer Katherine Newbey said ""no evidence had been served in the case"" and her client ""denies involvement"".
Mr Herba did not consent to extradition, meaning that a full hearing will have to take place.
Deputy Senior District Judge Tan Ikram remanded the suspect in custody, saying he was satisfied there were ""substantial grounds"" to believe he would fail to surrender if he was released.
Mr Herba is due to appear in the same court by video link for a bail application on 23 August.
A full extradition hearing has been scheduled for 25 September.
Ms Ayling, from Coulsdon, south London, arrived in Milan on 10 July for a photo shoot.
Italian police say she was attacked by two men, drugged with ketamine and abducted, apparently to be sold in an online auction.
She is believed to have been transported in a bag to an isolated village near Turin, Italy, but was released on 17 July.
Ms Ayling's lawyer Francesco Pesce has said she was told she would be sold in the Middle East ""for sex"".
Speaking after the alleged abduction, Ms Ayling said she feared for her life throughout the ""terrifying experience"".
""I'm incredibly grateful to the Italian and UK authorities for all they have done to secure my safe release,"" she said.
Italian police documents claim that suspect Lukasz Herba said he had got involved in order to raise money for cancer treatment.
The Polish national, who lives in Oldbury in the West Midlands, told investigators he drove her to the British consulate in Milan and released her before the sale went ahead.","The brother of the alleged captor of British model Chloe Ayling is to fight extradition to Italy, Westminster Magistrates' Court has heard."

Around 100,000 people in the United Kingdom have multiple sclerosis or MS, according to the Multiple Sclerosis Society.
It is normally diagnosed in people between the ages of 20 and 40.
Symptoms might include fatigue, vision problems and difficulties with walking, but MS is different for everyone.
In MS, the protective layer surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord - known as myelin - becomes damaged. The immune system mistakenly attacks the myelin, causing scarring or sclerosis.
The damaged myelin disrupts the nerve signals - rather like the short circuit caused by a frayed electrical cable.
If the process of inflammation and scarring is not treated, then eventually the condition can cause permanent neurodegeneration.
Michelle Mitchell, chief executive of the MS Society, said: ""MS is an unpredictable and challenging condition to live with and diagnosis can be upsetting and scary. The MS Society is here to help anyone affected by MS.""

"The decision means all working cameras on England's motorways and major trunk roads will be yellow by October next year.
Highways England confirmed the plan after ministers ordered a review into speed camera policy this year.
There are about 200 camera sites on England's motorways.
Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: ""I've always been clear that cameras should be visible and get used for safety rather than revenue raising.
""This move is about applying common sense to our roads. Speed cameras should make journeys safer rather than lead to dangerous braking.""
Grey cameras were first introduced on the M42 near Birmingham in 2006, following the introduction of variable speed limits.
Highways England chief executive Jim O'Sullivan said: ""We use cameras for safety and traffic management only when other more popular solutions, like engineering, are not adequate to tackle particular problems on our network.""
The Department for Transport (DfT) said the majority of colour changes will take place during the standard renewal of camera units to minimise costs.
Councils and police forces are required to publish information on the safety impact of speed cameras on local roads.  DfT guidance states these cameras should be yellow.","Grey speed cameras will be turned yellow in a bid to make them more visible and reduce incidents of sudden braking, the government has announced."
"The young leaders want greater autonomy and changes to the way Hong Kong is governed by China. Voter turnout reached a record high of 58%.
Among those elected is Nathan Law, 23, who helped lead the ""Umbrella Protests"" in 2014 for self-determination.
Despite the gains, China's supporters will continue to hold the majority of seats on the 70-seat council.
Mr Law expressed shock at the result, saying it showed people ""wanted change"".
The election is the first in the territory since the 2014 unrest, when central areas of Hong Kong were paralysed for weeks by mostly young protesters.
They were demanding greater democracy for the territory amid concerns that Beijing was increasingly interfering in the politics of the former British colony, breaking the ""one country, two systems"" agreement.
Beijing denies this, and gave no concessions to the protesters.
""I think Hong Kongers really wanted change,"" Mr Law, 23, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. ""Young people have a sense of urgency when it comes to the future.""
Mr Law, whose Demosisto party campaigns for the right to self-determination, had the second highest number of votes in the multi-seat Hong Kong Island constituency.
Two candidates from the Youngspiration party, a more vocally pro-independence movement which also has its roots in the Umbrella Protests, were also on course to be elected.
However, several veteran democrats failed to retain their seats.
""People want change, change meaning that they want new faces... but the price is a further fragmentation [of the pro-democracy camp],"" defeated candidate Lee Cheuk-yan told Reuters.
Mr Law warned that pro-democracy legislators would ""have to be united to fight against the [Chinese] Communist Party"".
Importantly for Mr Law and his allies, democrats have retained one third of seats in the council - meaning they have the ability to veto major constitutional changes.
There will also be more radical voices in the LegCo, with at least six young candidates who support self-determination for Hong Kong occupying seats.
China's government has always been opposed to any calls for independence, and an official from the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office of the State Council reiterated this point on Monday.
Meanwhile, the Hong Kong government's Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Raymond Tam said it would do its best to ""bring them [radical activists] around to a more centrist position"".
""Independence is not realistic at all,"" said Elizabeth Quat, a member of a pro-Beijing party. ""Hopefully this will not be their main objective.""
The Chinese government has consistently denounced pro-democracy protests, calling the 2014 street occupations ""illegal"", and stressed that unity is the way forward for the country.
Hong Kong papers have noted the ""record high turnout"" - the highest since 1997. Apple Daily describes ""a blazing atmosphere"", with hundreds queuing into the early hours.
The South China Morning Post notes that a ""new generation"" has emerged from the vote and may ""create more headaches for Chief Executive CY Leung's administration"".
A lot of mainland Chinese media have refrained from covering the election at all, or only covered it sparingly.
Regulators have even blocked some foreigner broadcasters' coverage of the elections - including the BBC World News channel - and censored social media comments that mention pro-democrats.
Yet the English language edition of Global Times says the days ahead will be ""a significant test of whether the pro-establishment camp can maintain dominance"".
Candidates were competing for the 70 seats on the LegCo, which passes laws and budgets in the territory. But only 35 constituency seats are directly elected by the 3.8 million registered voters.
Another 30 seats, called ""functional constituencies"", represent particular professions or trades and only people connected to those professions or trades can cast votes for those seats.
That is about 6% of the population, and they are mostly Beijing-leaning.
Representatives for a further five functional constituencies, known as ""super seats"" are chosen by voters across the territory.
The vote does not elect Hong Kong's chief executive, the head of government, but many analysts believe the outcome could have an impact on whether China supports current leader CY Leung for a second term in office.",A new generation of pro-democracy activists has won seats on Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo).
"According to his family, the 85-year-old died on Monday following a stroke.
White was chosen ahead of Ringo Starr in September 1962 to play drums on the single version of Love Me Do and its B-side, P.S. I Love You.
White, who was born in Glasgow in 1930, is also believed to have played on the album version of Please Please Me.
He could therefore legitimately claim to be one of the so-called ""Fifth Beatles"", alongside the likes of Pete Best, Stuart Sutcliffe and others.
White also played drums on Lulu's 1964 cover of Shout and Sir Tom Jones' 1965 single It's Not Unusual.
He went on to tour with Marlene Dietrich, Burt Bacharach and Rod Stewart and perform with the BBC Scottish Radio Orchestra.
In a 2009 interview with a New Jersey newspaper, White revealed he was often called to London's Abbey Road studios in the 1960s.
""I would get a call from EMI and you never knew what you were going to be asked to do,"" he told The Progress.
White was paid a one-off fee - Â£5 - for his three hours with the Beatles and received no subsequent royalties.
Starr, who played drums on earlier versions of Love Me Do, can be heard playing the tambourine on the White recording.
""You could tell it was something different and very special,"" White told the Daily Record in 2012. ""But I didn't know just how special it would become.""
In later life White emigrated to the US, where he married the voiceover actress Thea Ruth and became a drumming instructor.
The New York Metro Pipe Band, one of the bands with whom he worked, described him on Facebook as an ""all round gentleman"".
He was also called upon to teach drums to musician turned actor Steven van Zandt for his role as Silvio Dante in TV hit The Sopranos.
Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, White's family paid tribute to his ""amazing humility and humbleness about his many achievements"".","Andy White, the Scottish studio session musician who played the drums on Love Me Do and other early tracks by The Beatles, has died in New Jersey."
"He joins 13 other contenders in the crowded race.
Mr O'Leary, who appears on the reality show Shark Tank in the US and Dragon's Den in Canada, has been seriously exploring a bid since December.
He has drawn comparisons to Donald Trump for both his TV and business background and his boastful tendencies.
Former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper stepped down as party leader in November 2015 after losing the federal election to the Trudeau Liberals.
Conservatives pick their new leader on 27 May.
Mr O'Leary, a Montreal-born investor and entrepreneur, is pitching himself as the business-minded, fiscally conservative candidate in the packed field of hopefuls.
""I am a successful Canadian businessman with a great deal of international experience,"" Mr O'Leary said in a media statement. ""I am the only candidate who can beat Justin Trudeau.""
He is also positioning himself as the only contender who can stand up to US President-elect Donald Trump on cross-border issues like trade.
While he has repeatedly praised Mr Trump and his tactics in interviews, Mr O'Leary has avoided the anti-immigrant rhetoric used by the American real estate magnate during the campaign and has said he does not support many of his policies.
Mr O'Leary, born to Lebanese and Irish immigrants, has also criticised a proposal by fellow Conservative leadership contender Kellie Leitch to screen all immigrants for ""Canadian values"" as ""un-Canadian"".
Still, there are inescapable similarities between the two celebrity businessmen.
Mr O'Leary is a self-promoting political outsider with no experience in elected office. He can be pointed on Twitter and has taken to referring to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as a ""surfer dude"" on the social platform.
The Shark Tank cast member is known to float unconventional ideas, including a recent proposal to let people buy seats in the Senate, the un-elected upper house of Parliament.
He has been publicly toying with the idea of running to lead the Conservative party for months.
Other candidates have been taking shots at him on the campaign trail, including Lisa Raitt, a veteran politician who launched a ""Stop Kevin O'Leary"" website earlier this month and has targeted him for his ""irresponsible populism"".
He has also been criticised for not speaking French, one of Canada's official languages.
Bilingualism is convention among the country's political leaders. Over seven millions Canadians, mostly in the province of Quebec, speak French as their mother-tongue.

"The state's Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) said it wanted to better protect consumers, and prevent money-laundering.
It comes as a top Bitcoin exchange, Mt Gox, filed for bankruptcy last month.
Bitcoins have been gaining in popularity recently, but they are not governed by any financial regulator.
""The fact is that virtual currencies are unlikely to disappear entirely,"" said Benjamin Lawsky, New York's superintendent of financial services.
""As such, turning a blind eye and failing to put in place guardrails for virtual currency firms while consumers use that product is simply not a tenable strategy for regulators.""
The lack of any regulatory control or oversight of Bitcoins has triggered concerns on various fronts.
It is difficult to trace transactions carried out using Bitcoins - one of the factors behind their popularity - and the currency has been linked to illegal activity online.
Bitcoins are also seen by some as a route for tax evasion and money laundering.
Russia has declared transactions using the digital currency illegal, China has banned its banks from handling Bitcoin trades, and there have been calls for the US to do the same.
Singapore has imposed a tax on Bitcoin trading and using it to pay for services, after classifying it as goods, rather than a currency.
Earlier this month, the Japanese government also said Bitcoin is not a currency and that some transactions using the virtual unit should be taxed.
The collapse of Mt Gox has only added to the concerns.
The firm filed for bankruptcy in Japan in February after losing about $473m (Â£284m) worth of customers' bitcoins to what it says was a hacking attack.
""The recent problems at Mt Gox and other firms further demonstrate the urgent need for stronger oversight of virtual currency exchanges,"" said Mr Lawsky.
""Consumers should understand and receive appropriate disclosures about the potential risks associated with using virtual currencies or any other financial product.""","New York's financial regulator has called on firms to submit proposals to set up ""regulated"" exchanges for digital currencies like Bitcoin."
"The national average for take-up of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for 12 and 13 year-olds is 86%, but in Cornwall it is 57%.
Cancer charities called for the vaccine to be introduced in local schools.
Some GPs claimed the figures do not reflect the true picture. NHS England said the data was being reviewed.
It also said it was reviewing the delivery system in the South West but that the county's rural nature made a schools-based programme ""more challenging"".
The vaccine is offered in schools across most of England, but in Cornwall 12 to 13 year olds must see GPs for the jabs.
Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said the vaccine would ""have a major impact on reducing incidences of cervical cancer"" in the UK.
""We have been calling for a couple of years now to change how the programme works in Cornwall,"" he said.
""A schools-based programme means you can offer it to kids while they're at school rather than having to take them out to have the vaccine twice.""
The HPV vaccination is offered in two separate injections over a one-year period but up until last year it was three jabs. It protects against two strains of the sexually transmitted infection believed to cause 70% of cervical cancer cases.
Uptake in Cornwall has remained well below the national average for the past five years.
However, Dr Sarah Gray, GP Specialist in Women's Health, said the way the figures were recorded was misleading: ""What NHS England have counted is the number of jabs in a school year.
""If they don't quite get all three within a year it looks like we've failed,"" she said.
She also said Cornwall was doing well at immunising older teenage girls.
Louise Blenkinsop from Falmouth, 32, recovered from cervical cancer in 2013 after ""gruelling treatment"" and was left unable to have children.
""It is ridiculous that Cornwall is being overlooked. Provision should be made equal across the country,"" she said.
NHS England is responsible for commissioning the vaccine on behalf of Public Health England.
A spokesman said: ""Cornwall is a very rural county with a number of factors which make a school based model logistically more challenging to deliver than it would be in many other parts of the country.""
He said the system was being reviewed ""to assess both clinical effectiveness and value for money"" and that checks were  being done on last year's data to make sure it was accurate.","Girls in Cornwall who are not being vaccinated against cervical cancer are missing a ""life-saving opportunity"", a charity has said."
"He accused the government of failing on its deficit target, debt target and welfare cap - while pledging more taxes, debt and borrowing.
""The verdict could not be clearer - the so-called long-term economic plan has failed,"" he said.
Mr Hammond said there were not enough high earners to fund Labour ambitions.
Single market access
Giving his response to Mr Hammond's first Autumn Statement as chancellor, Mr McDonnell said the government was ""ill-prepared and ill-equipped"" to face Brexit - ""the greatest economic challenge of a generation"".
""The chaotic Tory handling of Brexit threatens the future,"" he told MPs. ""You must now do the right thing for British workers and businesses - you must insist on full, tariff-free access to the single market....
""If you stand up for British business and jobs in fighting for single market access, you will have our support.""
Turning to the rest of the statement, Mr McDonnell claimed six million people were earning less than the living wage and accused the Conservatives of treating so-called Jams - those who are ""just about managing"" - as being an ""electoral demographic"", adding ""to us they are our friends and the people we represent"".
""If you really want to make a fair tax system as well, you can start by bringing back the 50p rate for the very richest in our country.""
'Race to the bottom'
He said it was regrettable that the chancellor was still going ahead with some of the cuts to Universal Credits, accusing him of ""betraying"" working single parents who he claims are at least Â£2,300 worse off.
He called for additional support for the social care budget, stressing: ""We now have 3.9 million people on NHS waiting lists ... Many of those are waiting in pain and they have got no relief today.""
He described the scrapping of tenant and letting fees as ""a victory for Labour campaigning"", but said home ownership was still ""a dream"" for the under 25s because fewer houses had been built under the Conservatives since the 1920s.
He said the chancellor was ""continuing a race to the bottom"" on corporation tax, while continuing to cut public services and cut taxes for big businesses.
But in response, Mr Hammond said the top 1% of earners contribute 27% of the tax paid. ""Unfortunately, there aren't enough of them to finance all your ambitions.""","Chancellor Philip Hammond's spending plans ""offer no hope for the future"" after six ""wasted"" years, his Labour counterpart John McDonnell has claimed."

"Increased government spending will be responsible for one-third of the increase in the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2016-2017, latest government figures show.
What this essentially means is that the government will primarily drive economic growth in the current financial year.
This is likely to continue in 2017-2018 as well. The annual budget presented by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday seems to suggest as much.
The government has allocated 480bn rupees ($7.1bn; Â£5.6bn) to a scheme which guarantees every rural household 100 days of work each year. This is the highest allocation ever made to the programme.
The increased spending on the programme is intended to alleviate the negative impact of the government decision to ban high value notes in rural and semi-rural areas of India. A majority of transactions in these areas happen in cash, which has been in short supply since the rupee ban in November last year.
The jobs guarantee programme is also intended to alleviate the impact of the rupee ban on the informal manufacturing sector which operates in cash and tends to employ many semi-skilled and unskilled people who migrate to cities from rural India.
The government has also increased the allocation to an affordable housing scheme by more than 50% to 230bn rupees which is also expected to create some employment in rural India.  Close to half of India's population is engaged in agriculture which contributes only around 18% of GDP.
The allocation to 29 schemes sponsored by the central government has gone up by 21.6% and the allocation to the infrastructure sector has gone up by 13.5%.
Over and above this, the government has increased the lending target to a scheme that gives loans at low interest rates to micro-finance institutions and non-banking finance institutions. These in turn lend money to micro and small business entities engaged in manufacturing, trading and services activities.
Rural spending promise in India budget
India admits rupee ban bad for economy
To cut a long story short, the Modi government is trying to spend its way out of trouble, but it is not going overboard with it.
A part of this pump-priming became necessary because of the government's rupee ban self-goal, which is expected to pull down economic growth in 2016-2017.
The Economic Survey for 2016-2017 released on Tuesday, projected GDP growth at between 6.5-6.75% in 2016-2017, down from 7.9% in 2015-2016. The question is what economic growth could have been without the rupee ban.
When pushed in to a corner, most governments try to spend their way out of trouble.
Nevertheless, government spending is not always as effective as private spending. In the Indian case, a major reason is massive leakage.  This means that a large portion of government spending does not reach those it is meant for and is instead, siphoned off by the bureaucracy expected to distribute it.
One way to tackle this is for the government to concentrate on running a few important schemes on which it can spend the bulk of its money and focus its time and attention on.
The Economic Survey points out that ""the Budget for 2016-17 indicates that there are about 950 central sector and centrally sponsored sub-schemes in India"".
One negative impact of running so many schemes is that ""in many cases, the poorest districts are the ones grappling with inadequate funds. This is evidence of acute misallocation.""
A very important part of economic reform in India would be to bring down the number of these schemes. But that, as they always say, is easier said than done.
And as always, this budget missed out on this opportunity as well.

That followed leaked extracts being published by German newspaper Bild.
The 422-page report was written by former Fifa independent ethics investigator Michael Garcia.
He quit in protest when the organisation only released a 42-page summary of his document.
That version cleared Russia and Qatar, winners of the 2018 and 2022 hosting rights respectively, of corruption allegations.
However, it was critical of the actions of some Fifa executive committee members and some of the bidding teams, including England's.
The full report goes into more detail about this conduct, and also cites an interview given by the 2018 England World Cup bid chief Thompson around the national team's plans to travel to Thailand to secure a vote for their bid.
The offer to stage the friendly was made only eight days before the vote in 2010 to decide the 2018 and 2022 hosts. The offer was withdrawn three weeks later, by which stage it was clear Thailand had not supported the English bid.
The FA was open at the time about the friendly being arranged to win support.
But Garcia's report reads: ""Top English football officials recognised that arranging friendlies with a team from an executive committee's home country in order to advance the England 2018 bid was improper.
""Geoff Thompson candidly told the investigatory chamber he 'didn't think it was appropriate' to organise the proposed England-Thailand match-up or other friendlies targeting teams associated with executive committee members 'because I think it's a form of bribery'.
""The game's cancellation only underscores the improper relationship between the 24 November 2010 offer to play the game and the 2 December World Cup vote.""
Fifa said its president Gianni Infantino had always intended to release the full document, but its former ethics chiefs had refused to publish it.
The former chairmen of the ethics committee, Cornel Borbely and Hans-Joachim Eckert, were replaced in May after completing four-year terms.
Speaking in October 2014, Eckert said: ""Publishing the report in full would actually put the Fifa ethics committee and Fifa itself in a very difficult situation legally.""
The pair moved to clarify their position later on Tuesday, issuing a statement which said the decision not to publish ""was in line with Fifa rules"" as some cases brought as a result of the report were still ongoing.
They added: ""To this day, Mr Infantino has never contacted us and asked for a publication.""
Fifa said it had intended to discuss the release of the report at a meeting next month, but added: ""As the document has been illegally leaked to a German newspaper, the new chairpersons have requested the immediate publication of the full report in order to avoid the dissemination of any misleading information.
""For the sake of transparency, Fifa welcomes the news that this report has now been finally published.""
Qatar 2022 officials said they welcomed the report's publication, although they questioned ""the timing of the leak"", and said it represented ""a vindication of the integrity of our bid"".
BBC sports editor Dan Roan
Ever since ex-Fifa investigator Michael Garcia resigned in protest at the way his landmark corruption probe was handled in 2014, his secret report has been one of sport's great mysteries. Did it contain information that might force Fifa into a sensational re-vote for the hosting of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups?
The fact Fifa itself has finally published the report (albeit only after it had been forced to by a leak to a German newspaper), suggests it does not. Yes, the bidding process was highly dubious, and yes, Fifa executives were evasive, uncooperative and exploited ""a culture of entitlement"". But that is hardly a surprise.  And with Garcia denied full access to bank accounts, and no subpoena power, explosive allegations were always unlikely.
There are new details over the lengths most of the bid teams went to in order to curry favour with Fifa's discredited executives, including the FA. Amid highly embarrassing revelations, we now know Prince William and David Cameron were present when a vote-trading deal was agreed by former FA and England 2018 bid chairman Geoff Thompson, in breach of anti-collision rules.
But other details were already known. Garcia reinforces the perception of a culture of greed that it is now widely accepted to have gripped football's governing body.
But events have overtaken his report, with most of the former Fifa executive committee members that voted for Russia and Qatar already banned for unethical behaviour, indicted or under scrutiny. Criminal investigations into the bidding process continue.
While it does not appear to be a 'smoking gun', the report will be uncomfortable reading for Qatar. Among other details, Garcia says its 2022 bid used the Doha-based academy Aspire to ""curry favour with executive committee members"", and that this ""served to undermine the integrity of the bidding process"".
Qatar's hosting is already under renewed scrutiny amid a diplomatic crisis with its neighbours over its alleged support of extremism. Meanwhile, as it prepares to stage the final of the Confederations Cup, 2018 host Russia has been forced to fend off new doping allegations.
But with Garcia writing back in 2014 that he did ""not intend to pursue formal investigatory proceedings against any individual bid team member"", both hosts crucially appear to be in the clear.
Garcia was appointed as Fifa's independent ethics investigator in 2012 and asked to look into the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding process following claims of corruption around the bids.
They included allegations that disgraced Qatari football official Mohamed bin Hammam made payments totalling $5m (£3m) to football officials in return for their support for the Qatar bid.
Qatar vehemently denied votes were being bought and said Bin Hammam had not been acting in an official capacity.
Garcia spent two years investigating the claims and looked into all nine hosting bids - including one by the English FA.
Russia won the right to host the 2018 World Cup, beating England as well as joint bids by the Netherlands/Belgium and Spain/Portugal.
At the same time, in December 2010, Qatar won the 2022 bid ahead of Australia, Japan, South Korea and the United States.
Fifa released a 42-page summary of Garcia's final report in 2014. It cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing, ending any possibility of a re-vote for a new 2022 host.
However, the report said there were ""certain indications of potentially problematic conduct of specific individuals"" - though Bin Hammam's payments were judged to be for his personal political interests, not the 2022 bid.
Russia, meanwhile, was also cleared of any wrongdoing, though the investigation had ""only a limited amount of documents available for review"" because the Russian team's computers had been destroyed.
The English FA was accused of acting improperly in trying to win votes and flouting bid rules, while Australia too received criticism.
While Russia and Qatar welcomed the report, the FA baulked at the criticism.
The man who led the investigation, Garcia, complained Eckert's precis of his report was ""erroneous"".
Eckert denied that, insisting of his published summary: ""A lot of my report was word for word from the Garcia report.""
Garcia subsequently quit and Fifa's critics said it showed the shortened, released report had been a ""whitewash"" and called for the full report to be released.
Almost three years later, they have got their wish.","A plan for England to play a friendly in Thailand to win backing for their 2018 World Cup bid was ""a form of bribery"", investigators were told."
"He was selected to fight the South Basildon and East Thurrock seat after ex-Tory MP Neil Hamilton pulled out.
In a recording obtained by the Mail On Sunday, Mr Smith made offensive remarks about gay people, other UKIP members and Chigwell in Essex.
He later issued a ""wholehearted and unreserved apology"".
UKIP leader Nigel Farage told BBC News that Mr Smith had resigned ""by mutual consent"", and described his behaviour as ""loutish and wholly inappropriate"".
He said UKIP had had ""great difficulty"" with the Basildon selection, adding: ""The party has got to grip this and sort it out, in short order"".
Mr Farage also said UKIP's national executive committee had the power to impose a candidate if it wanted.
UKIP hopes to make a serious challenge for the South Basildon and East Thurrock seat in the forthcoming general election, in which it is seeking to win a handful of seats and potentially hold the balance of power.
But Mr Smith's resignation, four days after he was re-adopted as a candidate, capped a week of negative headlines for the party.
Mr Hamilton pulled out of contention for the seat amid questions raised by the party over his expenses while another candidate, Natasha Bolter, withdrew amid an investigation into allegations she made against Mr Bird, whose job is to vet election candidates.
Following his resignation on Sunday, Mr Smith said in a statement: ""I want the best for South Basildon and Thurrock and I want to see the real issues discussed that touch the lives of people.
""Therefore I have chosen to resign so that UKIP can win this seat next May.""
A parliamentary candidate resigns having tried blaming his racist comments on taking painkillers.
This comes days after an alleged sex scandal at UKIP Head Office in which the party's chief executive did - or did not - sleep with another candidate.
Meantime a wealthy donor is said to be threatening to stop funding the party if his friend doesn't get a seat. You may think that UKIP's week of bad headlines is just a diverting soap opera.
You may think it simply shows the growing pains of Britain's fastest growing political force. You may think it has no significance at all. If so, you'd be wrong.

During the recorded conversation, Mr Smith talks about UKIP's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) group. He can be heard jokingly referring to it as BLT UKIP, and adds ""what the old poofter groups call themselves"".
He jokes about ""shooting peasants"" from the Essex town of Chigwell and supporting ""a peasant's hunt through Chigwell village"".
A UKIP spokesman confirmed to the BBC that Mr Smith had apologised to Mr Farage for allegations made against him during the phone call - which Mr Smith has since retracted.
UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe, the party's immigration spokesman, said that ""racist and homophobic language"" would not be tolerated.
""When there is someone who has come out and expressed these type of views, which I abhor and dislike intensely, we have acted rapidly and we have got them out,"" he told Radio 4's Today programme.
UKIP's candidates, he claimed, were ""ordinary people"" who did not have the media training that their political rivals had and sometimes had to be ""guided"".
But he insisted the way the party was dealing with problems as they arose showed how it had matured.
""What we have seen over the last ten days is that UKIP has grown up rather dramatically,"" he added.
Mr Smith stood for UKIP in the Basildon seat in 2010, where he came fourth behind the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems.
But the party now regards the seat as one that it could possibly win and the selection process is now likely to be re-opened.
After Mr Hamilton withdrew his candidacy for the Basildon seat earlier this week, Channel 4 reported seeing a letter from UKIP's finance committee querying expenses claims made by him.
Mr Hamilton, UKIP's deputy chairman, said his decision to withdraw from the Basildon selection process was nothing to do with expenses, but that it was a UKIP ""dirty trick"" to stitch him up.",Kerry Smith has resigned as a UKIP prospective parliamentary candidate after apologising for offensive remarks he made in a phone call.
"The idea was discussed at a meeting between Justice Minister Caroline Dineage and parents who failed to receive the ashes of their dead babies.
It followed an inquiry into failings at Shrewsbury crematorium.
Glen Perkins, who formed the Action for Ashes campaign group, said Mrs Dineage had proposed a national consultation.
It is expected to include affected families throughout England and Wales as well as industry experts.
Mr Perkins - whose daughter Olivia died from sudden infant death syndrome in 2007 - described the meeting as ""very positive"" and said there was a willingness by the government to resolve the matter ""sooner rather than later"".
He was joined in Westminster by parents from Leicester, Hull, Banbury and Stoke-on-Trent.
They handed in a 61,000-signature petition calling for the return of ashes to be a legal requirement.
Families were accompanied by Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury, who has secured a parliamentary debate on the issue on Wednesday.
In a statement, Mrs Dineage said: ""Having heard the experiences of some of the families affected, it is clear we must do all we can to make sure this never happens again.
""No parent should have their grief compounded by a system that is supposed to help. The Emstrey report had a number of recommendations and it is imperative that we consider each one carefully.""
Last month, David Jenkins, who led the independent inquiry into failings in Shrewsbury, said he had been ""struck by the absence of authoritative national guidance"".
He proposed the creation of a national inspector of crematoriums.
About 60 families are believed to have been affected by failures at Shrewsbury's Emstrey crematorium between 1996 and 2012.
Speaking at the time, Mr Jenkins said there was clearly ""no more painful experience"" than losing a child and that the issue of infant cremation should be treated as of ""the utmost importance"".
A Freedom of Information inquiry by the BBC last year found the ashes of more than 1,000 babies were not handed to their parents between 2008 and 2013.
In March, former Justice Minister Simon Hughes had suggested new national guidelines could be brought in by the end of the year.
There was a real sense of positivity from the families that made the trip to London - a feeling they had done all they could to raise this issue.
Now they are keeping a close eye on what happens next.
I understand a consultation could start very soon and families are already being asked to register their details with the Ministry of Justice.
Emotions were high when the campaigners handed in their petition. Five families carried boxes full to the brim with signatures.
Glen Perkins, whose daughter Olivia died in 2007, was in tears on the steps of Number 10 Downing Street and that sums up the journey he and other families have been on.
Other families put their arms around him as they posed for photos and then knocked on the door to hand in their petition.
Of course it won't bring their child back and in many cases they will never know what happened to their ashes, but I think they do feel what they've done today has left a bit of a legacy in their child's name.","A consultation about baby cremations could be held across England and Wales with a view to changing legislation, bereaved families have said."
"Twenty-five international artists were sent debris from the Mackintosh library, which was gutted by fire in May 2014.
The work they created will be sold at auction to raise money for the Mackintosh Campus Appeal.
It is hoped £32m can be raised.
Other artists taking part include Grayson Perry, Cornelia Parker, Jenny Saville, David Shrigley and Douglas Gordon as well as The Chapman Brothers and Sir Peter Blake, with seven Turner prize winners among them.
Each artist was sent a piece of material specifically chosen for them with a note telling them what it was, where it was from and explaining the concept of the auction.
Perry, who has made an urn featuring the words ""Art is dead. Long live Art"", said: ""It's a tragedy. It's the most famous art school building in Britain.
""It's also the masterpiece of Mackintosh. It's a double tragedy.
""I was very excited when I received the box of charcoal. I had an idea almost immediately and the idea of making an urn was an obvious thing to do.
""The idea of memorialising or celebrating the difficulty - honouring the wound. It's something I'm trying to do. Move on and make the most of it.
""I really like the idea of using the charcoal from the fire. I thought it was very clever. It's also fresh - it's not something that has come up before.
""We've all been asked to do T-shirts, knickers and mugs - endless charity rounds. I get about two a week.""
The project, titled Ash To Art, was created by communications agency J. Walter Thompson London in collaboration with The Glasgow School of Art Development Trust.
The work will be on display at Christie's in London's King Street from 3-7 March and will be auctioned during the Post-War and Contemporary Art Day Sale on 8 March.
Each of the pieces, covering a range of practices including sculpture, photography, drawing and painting, has been created using remains from the fire, from charred timbers and debris to books and furniture.
They include Kapoor's wood fragments in a red perspex box and Gordon's burnt wood cast in bronze.
Students had been preparing for their degree shows when flames engulfed the Grade A-listed Charles Rennie Mackintosh building.
The blaze caused significant damage to the west wing, including the loss of the celebrated library.
An investigation by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service concluded it was caused by flammable gases from a canister of expanding foam.
The report said the gases ignited as they came into contact with the hot surface of a projector.
So far, the Mackintosh Campus Appeal has raised £18.5m.
Prof Tom Inns, director of the Glasgow School of Art, said: ""It has been a pleasure to work with the creative team at J. Walter Thompson London over the last two years on this imaginative initiative that will help in our efforts to raise the £32m required to make our vision a reality.""","Leading artists including Sir Antony Gormley, Anish Kapoor and Simon Starling have used material from the fire-damaged Glasgow School of Art to create new work and raise funds."
"The 29-year-old Saracens winger was omitted from the 32-man England squad that will tour Australia next month.
Ashton helped his club win the European Champions Cup and reach the Premiership final, but Jones feels Harlequins' Marland Yarde is a ""better fit"".
""There are parts of Ashton's game we're not happy with,"" he told BBC 5 live.
""We've spoken to him about that and if he can fix that then he can get in the squad.""
When asked whether Ashton, who has won 39 England caps, needs to improve defensively, Jones said their conversations were ""private"".
Ashton missed this year's Six Nations campaign after being given a 10-week ban for making contact with the eyes of Ulster's Luke Marshall during a European Champions Cup game.
He has scored 10 tries since his return, but the England boss suggested 24-year old Yarde, who crossed seven times this season, could have matched that feat given the opportunity.
""Marland's got a good, strong all-round game, great coachability. I think his best rugby is ahead of him,"" added the Australian.
""Ashton's done very well to score a lot of tries in a very strong team. You've always got to look at it in the context of what side they're playing for and the opportunities they have.
""He has done some good work. It's all relative to the strength of the team you're playing in and there are other areas of the game apart from scoring tries.""
New Zealand-born centre Ben Te'o, who will join Worcester from Leinster before the England party leaves for Australia, is one of four uncapped players named in the squad.
The 29-year-old switched codes in 2014, having represented Samoa in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup and won a National Rugby League title with South Sydney Rabbitohs.
Jones, who said Manu Tuilagi is expected to undergo scans on a hamstring injury on Monday, is pleased to have Te'o as an option.
""Ben's a very talented player,"" said the 56-year-old. ""He can play through the line, he's had a great season for Leinster. He's a big guy and he hits hard.
""Since I've taken the English job and known he wanted to play for England and qualifies for England, I've watched him carefully.
""I've kept in contact with him and he presents a great option for us at 12.""
Props Ellis Genge, of Bristol, and Harlequins' Kyle Sinckler have been included in Jones' squad, along with Northampton back row Teimana Harrison.
Jones says both of the uncapped props have a ""competitive edge"".
He added: ""Both aren't ready to scrummage at Test level but both have got potential, so we need to bring them through.
""Genge is a boy that's not afraid of anything and that's what we need to beat Australia. He's aggressive and he can run with the ball and he's got that bit of an edge about him.""
The former Australia and Japan head coach continued: ""Harrison has been absolutely outstanding for the Saints.
""The robustness of his play, his physicality and his ball carries, his low tackling and his coachability make him a great player to add to the squad.
""He's got a hard back row to break in to. Robbo [Chris Robshaw], James Haskell and Billy [Vunipola] obviously did well during the Six Nations and there's no reason they can't continue to play well.""

"Christopher Hales was found guilty of professional misconduct over property deals linked to MP Michelle Thomson.
She was elected an SNP MP but withdrew the party whip after the case emerged.
The Law Society found that claims staff might have deliberately halted progressing the case until after the election were ""completely unfounded"".
Mr Hales had carried out work for M&F Property Solutions, a firm businesswoman Ms Thomson was a partner of.
Following a hearing in May 2014, the Scottish Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal said Mr Hales failed to provide mortgage companies with key information used to prevent fraud and must have been aware that there was a possibility he was facilitating mortgage fraud, whether or not it occurred.
The deals he was investigated for had been carried out on behalf of M&F Property Solutions, a firm businesswoman Ms Thomson was a partner of.
She remains an MP at Westminster and has strenuously denied she did anything wrong.
After the link between Mr Hales and Ms Thomson came to light, the Law Society undertook a review of its handling of the case.
It concluded that;
Christine McLintock, president of the Law Society, said: ""We took swift action after identifying the issues at Christopher Hales' firm in 2011, which included rapidly suspending Mr Hales from practice and making a suspicious activity report. Following our investigation we prosecuted him before the the Scottish Solicitors' Discipline Tribunal (SSDT) , which resulted in him being struck off.
""We said we would examine the issues raised as a result of this case to determine what lessons could be learned.

"Marshall Leonard is being held by police after throwing a bomb into one of the department stores in Tupelo, Mississippi, early on Sunday.
Mr Leonard is known in the city for the 4ft (1.2m) flag he flies over his car.
Nobody was hurt or injured by the improvised device that produced only a loud bang but no damage.
""An employee was sitting in the vestibule taking a break. He told the employee to run - that he was going to blow the place up,"" said Police Chief Bart Aguirre.
The suspect then threw the newspaper-wrapped package into the store - around 0130 local time (0630 GMT).
Walmart, along with several other retailers, pulled the battle flag and other memorabilia from their shelves following the killing in June of nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina.
The man charged with the killings was pictured holding the flag.
Explosives experts said that the package contained enough explosive material to damage the store, but its poor assembly rendered it ineffective.
He was arrested by police about a half-hour later when his silver Mazda adorned with stickers of battle flag and the Mississippi state flag - which itself features an inset Confederate battle flag - was seen running a red traffic light.
""He's a strong supporter of keeping that flag flying,"" the police chief said. ""This is his way of bring attention to that"".
Mr Leonard, who lives alone and is unemployed, does not currently have a lawyer, but will be appointed one by a judge if it is deemed he cannot afford one.
The Confederate battle flag became a potent symbol for the southern states fighting the Civil War as they sought to break away from the union.

"In a landmark hailed as ""long overdue"", Prof Maryam Mirzakhani was recognised for her work on complex geometry.
Four of the medals were presented in Seoul at the International Congress of Mathematicians, held every four years.
Also among the winners was Prof Martin Hairer from the University of Warwick, UK, whose work on randomness could prove useful for climate modelling.
Awarded by a committee from the International Mathematical Union (IMU), the Fields Medal is regarded as something akin to a Nobel Prize for maths. It was established by Canadian mathematician John Fields and comes with a 15,000 Canadian dollar (Â£8,000) cash prize.
First awarded in 1936 and then every four years since 1950, the medal is awarded to between two and four researchers, who must be no older than 40, because Fields wanted to encourage the winners to strive for ""further achievement"" as well as recognise their success.
The other two medals were won by Dr Artur Avila, a Brazilian mathematician who earned his PhD in dynamical systems at the age of 21, and Prof Manjul Bhargava, a Canadian-American number theorist at Princeton University.
In becoming the very first female medallist, Prof Mirzakhani - who teaches at Stanford University in California -  ends what has been a long wait for the mathematics community.
Prof Dame Frances Kirwan, a member of the medal selection committee from the University of Oxford, pointed out that despite maths being viewed traditionally as ""a male preserve"", women have contributed to mathematics for centuries.
She noted that around 40% of maths undergraduates in the UK are women, but that proportion declines rapidly at PhD level and beyond.
""I hope that this award will inspire lots more girls and young women, in this country and around the world, to believe in their own abilities and aim to be the Fields Medallists of the future,"" Prof Kirwan said.
Prof Sir John Ball, another British mathematician and a former president of the IMU, agreed that Prof Mirzakhani's win was ""fantastically important"". Speaking to BBC News from the congress in Seoul, South Korea, he said that a female winner was overdue and that Prof Mirzakhani is one of many brilliant women mathematicians.
He added that the committee had an unenviable job choosing the winners. ""These four are really deserving of this recognition, but of course any work at this level also builds on exceptional work by other people.""
Prof Mirzakhani's seminal research concerns shapes called Riemann surfaces. These are convoluted mathematical objects that can be analysed using complex numbers - i.e. numbers with real and imaginary parts.
In particular, she has studied ""moduli spaces"" of these shapes, which map all of the possible geometries of a Riemann surface into their own, new space.
Prof Alison Etheridge, a lecturer in applied mathematics at the University of Oxford, said she was thrilled by the announcement.
""Women are doing so well now in mathematics that this is just icing on the cake,"" Prof Etheridge told the BBC. ""It's the sort of thing which will really catch the public's imagination - and as a result I think it could have quite an impact on a new generation.""
Prof Etheridge is more familiar with the work of the medallist from Warwick, Martin Hairer.
""I think Martin has done some of the most remarkable mathematics,"" she said.
""Traditionally, maths has been quite divided into pure and applied. But what has happened over the past decade or so, is that people have realised that to do modern applied mathematics, you really need a whole armoury of techniques from pure mathematics - especially if you're going to take account of random effects.
""What Martin's work does is it allows you to take account of randomness in a way we just didn't think was possible.""
Prof Hairer's award is specifically for his contribution to a particular type of equation, known as a partial differential equation or PDE. His theory allows mathematicians to predict how physical processes will develop when they contain elements of randomness.
A key example is modelling how the boundary changes over time between two different substances. Prof Terry Lyons, a colleague of Prof Hairer's at Oxford, uses the example of the interface between ash and paper, when a sheet is slowly burning.
""But the sort of examples that it applies to in the longer term are boundless,"" Prof Lyons added, noting that climate science in particular was ""where it might end up"".
""Martin has tackled a fundamental problem and achieved a complete step-change in our understanding of it.""
Caroline Series, a fellow maths professor at the University of Warwick where Prof Hairer works, said she was ""utterly delighted"" for her colleague.
""It's fantastic news for Warwick,"" she told the BBC.
Prof Series has also known Prof Mirzakhani and her work for some time.
""I came across her a long time ago when she was a PhD student, and I was sent a preliminary draft of her thesis. And I just read it in amazement - it was beautiful.
""She took something that's been known for a while, and she took a rather elaborate and hard to understand identity between things, and she just applied it in the most ingenious and wonderful way.""
Prof Series believes the first female Fields winner is a rare talent, who has produced unique and striking work.
""I'm quite genuine about that,"" she said. ""I almost never think that about bits of mathematics!""

Their mummified bodies were kept in a basement flat in the city's Gilmore Place, which was regularly visited by a son of the couple, until 2002.
Since their discovery, the bodies have been stored in the city's mortuary.
Edinburgh city council has been trying to get the family's consent to bury Mr and Mrs Marcel, but this has been repeatedly refused.
Now, almost 30 years after Mrs Marcel died, the council has lodged a petition at the Court of Session to seek permission to dispose of their bodies.
Prof Roderick Paisley from Aberdeen University's Law School said: ""The wheels of justice do grind slowly, and they appear to be grinding incredibly slowly on this particular hearse.

"Some of the victims reported the abuse to police after reading press reports about Peter Farrands being jailed for seven years in May 2015.
As well as working at Folville Rise Junior School in Leicester, Farrands was a scoutmaster and lay preacher.
The four victims were aged between six and 12 when Farrands abused them.
Sentencing Farrands, Judge Nicholas Dean QC said: ""This was a breach of trust as a school teacher and a scoutmaster and the effect continues to haunt the victims.
""The sentence must seem lenient to the victims but they should look at the total sentence.""
He pleaded guilty to seven additional charges of indecent assault against boys between 1976 and 1981.
Leicestershire Police said Farrands committed most of his crimes at Folville Rise Junior School.
Det Sgt Hazel Sandall hopes the case will encourage other victims of historical abuse to come forward.
She said: ""No matter how old the offender and no matter how many years ago crimes took place, we will conduct a thorough examination of the evidence and will not hesitate to seek charges being brought against perpetrators of crime where evidence is available to us.""
Two of the victims came to Leicester Crown Court, where Farrands appeared via video link, to see him sentenced.
The court heard one victim contacted the NSPCC in 2014 and said he had been abused by Farrands and two other people, who he believed have since died.
Some of the boys were assaulted multiple times.
In a statement read out in court, one of the victims said he is still receiving counselling because of what happened.
""There is still a lot of pain,"" he said.

"The prime minister has said Britain will vote on whether to remain in the EU on Thursday 23 June.
David Cameron announced the referendum date after a cabinet meeting on Saturday to discuss his deal with the EU he says gives the UK special status.
Mrs Foster said the DUP will recommend to voters to leave the EU.
""At every stage in this European negotiation process we had hoped to see a fundamental change to our relationship with Europe,"" she said.
""In our view, we see nothing in this deal that changes our outlook.  Therefore we will on balance recommend a vote to leave the EU.
""As every voter has the opportunity to express a view, we fully expect that DUP members and voters will hold a range of differing personal views as to what is in the best interests of the United Kingdom.
""They are fully entitled to do so during what will be a momentous political debate about the direction of travel our nation chooses.""
The SDLP and Sinn FÃ©in are to campaign to remain within the EU, with the Alliance Party expected to do the same. The Ulster Unionists are still considering their position.
Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness said the benefits of EU membership could ""be felt daily across all sections of our society"".
""In particular, our agriculture and agri-food industry have gone from strength to strength with the help of EU Single Farm Payments,"" he said.
""The EU has also supported key infrastructure projects and boosted our economy through peace and structural funds.
""It has also been a key supporter of the progress made in the peace and political processes over the last two decades.""
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the referendum will be one of the most important votes faced by people in Northern Ireland in decades.
""It is therefore vital that a strong and positive campaign is conducted to remain in Europe.
""The SDLP's campaign has already begun and today I am calling on the leaders of Sinn FÃ©in, the Alliance party and the Green Party to do their utmost in ensuring that Northern Ireland delivers a strong vote to remain in the EU on 23 June.
""I would also urge the Ulster Unionist Party to do what is best for farmers and families and campaign for an In vote.""
Meanwhile, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State has declared her intention to join the campaign in favour of leaving the EU.
David Cameron has suspended collective responsibility over the issue of the UK's future membership of the EU.
This means Eurosceptic ministers can campaign in favour of Brexit - against the official government position.
Theresa Villiers is one of five cabinet ministers who joined the ""Leave"" camp.
Others include Justice Secretary Michael Gove, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the House of Commons Chris Grayling, and Culture Secretary John Whittingdale.
Employment Minster Priti Patel, who is not a full cabinet member, is also in favour of leaving.
Home Secretary Theresa May heads the list of those who have announced they will campaign to stay.
Other ministers who declared they will campaign to remain in the EU include Business Secretary Sajid Javid, International Development Secretary Justine Greening and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin.
David Cameron announced the date of the referendum after holding a cabinet meeting on Saturday to discuss his new deal with the EU.
He says the agreement gives Britain ""special status"".
The DUP's Sammy Wilson said the negotiations prove the EU is not capable of reform.
The SDLP will be campaigning to stay in the EU and its leader, Colum Eastwood, said Mr Cameron is pursuing a ""reckless strategy"" which is ""creating economic uncertainty across Ireland"".
The Republic of Ireland minister for foreign affairs, Charlie Flanagan, has described the prime minister's EU deal as ""positive"" and ""very significant"".
Mr Cameron claims his EU reform deal - hammered out at a two-day summit in Brussels - will give the Britain ""special status"" within the bloc - tackling concerns over migrants getting ""something for nothing"" from the benefit system and exempting the country from the EU drive for ""ever closer union"".

"Christian Calderwood was forced to stop by other drivers who surrounded him with their vehicles and took his keys.
Stirling Sheriff Court was told that Calderwood, 42, was barely able to stand by the time police arrived.
Calderwood, of Kirkintilloch, East Dunbartonshire, will be sentenced in April.
The court heard that Calderwood was spotted driving erratically on the M80, west of Stirling, at about 17:00 on 23 May last year.
Motorists saw him speeding up and slowing down, and veering from lane to lane.
Lindsey Brooks, prosecuting, said that other motorists were so concerned about the way he was driving that they began to follow him, and saw that he then joined the M9.
A truck driver saw Calderwood's car come up behind him, almost hit him, then overtake and just miss the rear of the lorry before drifting onto the hard shoulder and back again onto the motorway.
After seeing further erratic driving, the truck driver slowed to a halt near the Park of Keir roundabout forcing Calderwood to stop behind him.
Mrs Brooks said other motorists stopped alongside Calderwood, ""effectively blocking him in"".
One witness took the keys out of his car's ignition.
Mrs Brooks said: ""The witnesses spoke to the accused, who seemed to be confused and foaming from the mouth.
""The police noted he was unsteady on his feet, unaware of his surroundings, where he was, or what he was doing.
""There appeared to be white powder round his mouth and the officers said they were having difficulty keeping him awake.""
He was told to take a roadside breath test, but did not appear to understand what he was being asked to do.
A blood test later showed high levels of Etizolam, a benzodiazepine which is prescribed for anxiety and insomnia in India and Japan.
Calderwood admitted driving while unfit through drugs.
Sheriff Richard McFarlane deferred sentence for four weeks for reports and disqualified Calderwood from driving in the interim.
He said: ""From the description I have, you were hardly fit to stand, let alone drive a vehicle.""","A man who drove for 20 miles on a motorway after taking drugs was ""foaming from the mouth"" when he was stopped by police, a court has heard."

"The plans include the rebuilding of the North/South Stand and an increase in ground capacity from 17,000 to 20,000.
Club chairman Colin Graves said the changes were necessary to ensure the ground could continue to host international matches.
A detailed consultation over the plans will be held, the club said.
If given the go-ahead, the proposals will also see the installation of floodlights, extra seating in the upper tier of the North East Stand and the development of a new five-storey pavilion.

Mr Graves said it was ""the most ambitious project the club and the venue will have undertaken since the ground was first established 125 years ago"".
""As other venues around the country continue to invest in their facilities, we cannot afford to stand still and expect that Headingley will always host international cricket,"" he said.

"Andrew Whitby, 51, from Teddington, south-west London, was recognised by the Guinness Book of Records.
He underwent the operation after experiencing health problems associated with a lifelong heart defect.
He appealed for people to sign the organ donor register, describing transplantation as ""life-changing"".
Figures published by the NHS on Monday show the number of people in the UK donating organs after death has fallen for the first time in more than a decade.
Mr Whitby was born with a hole in the heart, which doctors predicted would mean he was unlikely to live more than a few years.
He defied expectations and lived normally until the age of 20, when his health began to deteriorate.
Mr Whitby developed problems with his lungs and eventually one collapsed, which led to the decision to attempt a heart-lung transplant.
When the procedure was carried out in 1985 at Harefield Hospital in north-west London, he was only the ninth person to undergo it in the UK.
Heart-lung transplants are relatively rare because there are few suitable donor organs available and priority is normally given to people who only need a heart transplant.
Mr Whitby used the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his transplant to draw attention to the need for organ donors.
He said: ""My heart-lung transplant has improved and extended my life beyond measure.
""We need more people to sign the organ donor register - without donors, where would that leave people like me?""
Andre Simon, director of transplantation at Harefield Hospital, said: ""Andrew's world record shows how a person's life can be completely transformed through the gift of organ donation.""",A man has celebrated 30 years since his heart-lung transplant - thought to be the longest anyone has survived after the procedure.

More than 100,000 people went to Colombia last weekend, the second time the border was open in a year.
They crossed to buy basic goods that are in short supply in their country because of a severe economic crisis.
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ordered the closure to fight cross-border crime. He said the area had been infiltrated by Colombian paramilitaries and gangs.
The UN human rights office called on Venezuela to consider accepting ""humanitarian aid"" to ensure food and medicine supplies were distributed.
Colombia's Foreign Minister, Maria Angela Holguin, said a decision had been made to not allow any further temporary reopening of the border.

"Media playback is not supported on this device
The former England defender suffered a heart attack at Tottenham Hotspur's training centre on Thursday.
Ehiogu only spent a year with Rangers at the tail-end of his career.
But Thomson told BBC Scotland: ""He will never be forgotten by the Rangers fans and I see a lot on social media - they think very highly of him.""
Ehiogu, who won four caps for his country, was signed for Rangers by Walter Smith in January 2007 after being released by Middlesbrough following a seven-year spell at the Riverside.
Smith had taken over that month from Paul le Guen, whose side were trailing eventual champions Celtic.
Ehiogu partnered fellow veteran David Weir at the heart of the defence but lost his starting the place the following season and was released six months before the end of his 18-month contract.
However, Thomson thinks Ehiogu was instrumental in establishing the base that helped Rangers regain the Scottish title a few months after his departure.
""It was a turning point in Rangers' history when Walter came in and tried to change the team and steady the ship,"" said the former Scotland midfielder.
""And big Ugo and Davie Weir were fundamental to that swinging of the momentum.""
Ehiogu only scored once for Rangers, but his decider in a 1-0 victory over Celtic in March 2007 was voted goal of the season by the club's fans.
""It was a special goal and probably one you would never expect from Ugo - an acrobatic overhead kick,"" said Thomson.
""I still picture him standing on the stage receiving his goal of the season award and all suited and booted to an amazing round of applause.""
Thomson himself later joined Middlesbrough and discovered that Ehiogu, who suffered a heart attack at Tottenham Hotspur's training ground, had left a lasting impression with staff members there too.
""He was a lovely fella and, although I never knew him that well, I only spent five or six months with him, he was a true gent and he was everything you would expect in a true professional who had played at the very highest level,"" said the former midfielder.
""We both used to like a steam room after the game and I used to nip his ear and ask for advice on different things on and off the field and he was one of those boys, a bit like Davie, who welcomed giving you as much advice as possible.""
Weir, who also played and coached against Ehiogu in England, echoed his former team-mate's sentiments.
""I'm devastated with the news and still in shock,"" Nottingham Forest assistant boss Weir told BBC Scotland.
""I'm sure as time goes on that goal (against Celtic) will be the abiding memory of Ugo at Rangers but I remember him more just as a nice guy to be honest.
""He was giant of a man but really gentle as a personality.
""He was a fantastic player - I think he had 400 odd games in the English Premier League and you don't do that easily.""
In an official website statement, Rangers said the club was ""shocked and saddened"" by Ehiogu's death.
""The 44-year-old Englishman joined the Light Blues when Walter Smith returned as manager in 2007 and made a huge impact in his short time in Glasgow - notably his winning goal at Celtic Park in the derby,"" they added.","Ugo Ehiogu, who has died at the age of 44, will be forever remembered fondly by Rangers fans, according to former Ibrox team-mate Kevin Thomson."

"Only a detailed investigation can uncover what vital clues may have been missed as to the extremist leanings and murderous intentions of the killers.
These are some of the questions that need answers.
What happened to the tracking of the killers by the police and security agencies?
Two were known to the authorities. It is also believed that there were links with extremists in the UK and Yemen.
It is reported that the police decided to stop tracking them six months earlier.
What were the reasons behind this decision?
Were vital clues lost when it came to sharing information between the French authorities and other international agencies?
How organised were the attacks? What was the precise level of co-ordination and planning?
Was it a ""home grown"" terror attack, with inspiration and training coming from elsewhere?
Or was it planned and instigated through a wider network?
The claims of the perpetrators themselves have to be treated with caution until more is known about the detailed planning of the attacks and the training and travel movements of the individual terrorists.
How and where did the killers obtain the weapons to carry out the attacks?
How did they manage to conceal their arms cache without someone becoming suspicious?
Are there others still at large who may have helped?
The acquisition and transport of the weapons seems to have slipped past the radar of the police.
What role did Hayat Boumeddiene play?
The Turkish foreign minister said the widow of the Jihadist in the deli siege flew to Turkey on 2 January, well before the Charlie Hebdo massacre. She is now said to be in Syria.
We simply don't know enough about her role at this stage but some reports say she helped plan the attacks.

The sperm whales are believed to be from a pod spotted off the Norfolk coast.
The fifth whale was found at Wainfleet, Lincolnshire, on Monday afternoon, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency reported.
It was found on the site of a former bombing range, and warnings have been issued for people to stay away.

"Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb made the pledge in his first speech since replacing Iain Duncan Smith, who quit as discord broke out in the Tory party over the cuts.
Earlier, the PM defended Chancellor George Osborne, whose Budget is missing £4.4bn since the cuts were dropped.
Labour said Mr Osborne should resign and the Budget should be withdrawn.
Both David Cameron and Mr Crabb praised Mr Duncan Smith, who has said the government risked dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts.
The new work and pensions secretary confirmed the changes to Personal Independence Payments had been cancelled and told MPs: ""After discussing this issue over the weekend with the prime minister and the chancellor we have no further plans to make welfare savings beyond the very substantial savings legislated for by Parliament two weeks ago.""
A Downing Street spokesman said the government would still deliver on its commitment to save £12bn from welfare by the end of the Parliament in 2020.
Mr Crabb also said the government welfare cap, branded ""arbitrary"" by Mr Duncan Smith, had ""strengthened accountability"" and its level would be reviewed in the Autumn Statement later this year.
""I am absolutely clear that a compassionate and fair welfare system should not be just about the numbers,"" he added.
""Behind every statistic there is a human being, and perhaps sometimes in government we forget that.""
Stephen Crabb provided the usual Westminster wriggle room - no ""planned"" extra cuts - rather than ruling out taking the axe to the benefits budget ever, ever again.
But couple that with his comments in the Commons - ""behind every statistic is a human being and perhaps sometimes in government we forget that"" - and it seems the new secretary of state was displaying just as much sympathy with his predecessor's views as with the chancellor or the prime minister.
I'm told the plan to make that announcement was Mr Crabb's but the language was agreed by Downing Street and Number 11. The irony was perhaps that Iain Duncan Smith was nowhere to be seen in Westminster, absent for the announcement he might have longed to make himself.

The Conservative leadership has been under fire - including from some of its own backbenchers - over the cuts to disability payments, which came at the same time as tax cuts for higher earners.
Mr Duncan Smith - who resigned on Friday - said this flew in the face of Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne's oft-repeated claim that ""we are all in this together"".
London mayor Boris Johnson welcomed the fact that the cuts had been shelved but he said he rejected ""totally and utterly"" claims that the government was pursuing divisive policies.
Speaking to ITV's The Agenda, he said Mr Duncan Smith should have ""stayed and fought his point of view"" from within cabinet, saying his walkout was ""a storm in a teacup"".
Mr Cameron addressed Mr Duncan Smith's attack during a statement about the European Council in the Commons on Monday afternoon.
He stressed to MPs that the Conservatives remained a ""modern, compassionate, one nation"" party under his leadership.
He listed policies aimed at low-earners including the National Living Wage and rebuilding ""sink estates"", adding:  ""None of this would be possible if it wasn't for the actions of this government and the work of the chancellor in turning our economy around.""
The changes to Personal Independence Payments which prompted his resignation have now been shelved, and ministers plan to say how the planned £4bn savings will be found at the Autumn Statement later in the year.
Responding to Mr Cameron's statement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised Mr Osborne's absence from the Commons chamber and said the U-turn on disability benefits had created an ""enormous hole"" in the Budget, adding that the package had ""inequality at its core"".
He did not mention Mr Duncan Smith's resignation or his parting shot at the government.
When Labour MP Liz Kendall did put Mr Duncan Smith's criticism to the PM, Mr Cameron said he was sad at his colleague's resignation, adding: ""But I can guarantee that work of being a compassionate Conservative government will continue.""
The changes to the Budget were the subject of an urgent question from Labour before Mr Cameron's statement.
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called on Mr Osborne to resign following Mr Duncan Smith's resignation and the furore over the PIP cuts, but Downing Street says the chancellor has the full confidence of the prime minister.
Mr McDonnell said Mr Osborne's absence from the Commons chamber ""insults this House"" and that Treasury Minister David Gauke had been left to ""defend the indefensible"".
He added: ""This is no way to deliver a Budget and no way to manage an economy.""
Mr Gauke said the chancellor would be in the chamber for Tuesday's Budget debate, and said Labour was not in a position to comment on ""black holes"" in budgets.
He said spending on Personal Independence Payments was up by £3bn since 2010, adding that the Budget ""closes the gap between rich and poor and North and South"".
As well as the welfare changes, Downing Street says ministers will not seek to oppose amendments to scrap the so-called ""tampon tax"" and an increase in VAT on solar panels.",Ministers have said say they will not target other benefits to pay for abandoning cuts to disability payments.

The border with Tajikistan is porous, and it is used for the smuggling of Afghan opium and heroin to Central Asia, which finally finds its way to Europe.
Any side controlling Kunduz would not only influence the surrounding areas, but could also control one of the most important drug smuggling routes in the region.
Security for the region - which was a flagship project for the German army - was transferred to Afghan forces in 2013.
But Kunduz has many other problems: bad governance as well as incompetence and intimidation by some local officials have alienated many in the province.
It has long been at the frontline of a determined campaign by the Taliban to reclaim it. In May last year the BBC's David Loyn reported from there as fighting between government forces and the Taliban unfolded.
The Taliban already control huge chunks of the province's rural areas, where the majority of the population lives. The insurgents have intensified their fighting in the province over the past two years.
A BBC reporter visited the city after it was back in government hands following its September 2015 capture. He found shock, a jail emptied of prisoners and many residents fearful of a Taliban return.
The battle for the city saw one of the worst incidents in the recent Afghan war when a Medecins sans Frontieres hospital was hit by a US air strike.
The city is  estimated to have about 300,000 residents but those numbers are likely to be fluid because fighting has prompted many to flee the city.
Tens of thousands of people were displaced, living in shelters, spread across large tracts of countryside.
Although the insurgents were pushed back, they always had numbers in the region and many observers believed it was only a matter of time before a determined assault was attempted.
BBC Afghan's Dawood Azami and Inayatulhaq Yasini contributed to this report.",The brief militant seizure of Kunduz in 2015 was one of the Afghan government's worst setbacks since Taliban forces were ousted in 2001.

The HPA said hot tubs posed a health risk if not regularly maintained.

In a repeat of the 2015 quarter-final, McGill gained revenge despite falling 5-4 behind after the first session.
A high-quality encounter saw world number 30 McGill and 2005 champion Murphy make two centuries each.
Five-time champion Ronnie O'Sullivan opened up a 6-3 lead over qualifier David Gilbert in the first round.
O'Sullivan made breaks of 82, 74 and 71, but world number 22 Gilbert showed his ability with a superb 125 clearance. They play to a finish on Monday from 10:00 BST.
Alan McManus progressed with a 10-7 victory over fellow Scot Stephen Maguire, who lost in the first round for the fourth consecutive year. McManus will face Ali Carter in the second round on Thursday.
In Sunday's evening session, Welshman Mark Williams took a 7-2 lead over fellow former champion Graeme Dott of Scotland, while England's Sam Baird led Michael White of Wales 5-4. Both matches resume on Monday (19:00 BST).
Murphy, 33, becomes the third world champion after Peter Ebdon and Stuart Bingham to exit the competition.
This is only the second time that the previous year's finalists have both fallen at the first hurdle.
The last occasion was in 1980 when Terry Griffiths and Dennis Taylor both lost in the second round after receiving first-round byes.
McGill, 25, comes up against Ebdon's conqueror Marco Fu in the next round.

Relive Tottenham's draw at Fiorentina here
Tottenham would be forgiven for prioritising domestic success over European glory this season, given they are in a strong position to challenge for a first league title in 55 years.
They are second in the Premier League, two points behind leaders Leicester, but manager Mauricio Pochettino has expressed a desire to win every competition they are involved in.
Although he made six changes to the side that beat Manchester City on Sunday, there were still several first-teamers involved, including Alli, Christian Eriksen and Chadli.
For large periods of the match they looked like the home side as Fiorentina, perhaps aware of the visitors' threat on the counter-attack, adopted a cautious approach and did not have a shot on target in the first half.
It was not a classic Tottenham display, but the fact a much-changed team was able to secure a positive result away to a team that has won 10 of their 13 home games this season bodes well for Pochettino's ambitions.
Pochettino has been widely praised for nurturing Tottenham's young talent, with Alli one of the most exciting to emerge during his tenure.
The 19-year-old once again showed glimpses of the brilliance he is capable of, notably producing a neat bit of skill that almost got him out of trouble when surrounded by four Fiorentina players.
He did, however, show immaturity when he appeared to kick out at defender Nenad Tomovic, and was perhaps lucky to only be booked.
It might have been easy for Pochettino to substitute the midfielder soon after to avoid a potential sending off, but the Argentine instead showed his trust in the youngster by keeping him on.
Pochettino was almost rewarded late on when Alli's spectacular acrobatic effort was just over.
Tottenham boss Pochettino, speaking about Alli appearing to kick an opponent: ""We need to try to teach him
""He is a young player and he has a lot to learn about elite football.
""It is his first season in the Premier League at Tottenham. He came from League One, he needs to learn a lot. But I didn't see it. Some people say 'yes', say 'no', so I don't know.""

"Students from Wales will be able to claim up to £4,954 in grants and borrow the rest, wherever they study.
The announcement comes ahead of the publication of the Diamond report into higher education and student finance.
One senior academic has warned that Welsh universities could become ""second rate"" if they could not increase fees.
Education Secretary Kirsty Williams said: ""This decision gives certainty for those who want to go to university for the academic year 2017/18, giving people the option to study where they choose, including in England where tuition fees are set to increase.""
Currently, students from Wales pay the first £3,900 of their annual tuition fees, with the Welsh Government paying up to £5,100.
As well as the tuition fee grant and loans, Ms Williams announced a means-tested maintenance grant of up to £5,161.
She has argued that living costs are a bigger barrier than tuition fees to poorer students going to university.
The UK government linked its permission for higher fees at English universities to better teaching, with the new maximum of £9,250 possibly increasing by inflation in future years.
In August, Swansea University vice-chancellor Prof Richard Davies warned higher education in Wales risked becoming ""second rate"" if colleges could not increase their fees as in England.
Responding to Friday's announcement, he claimed there had not been ""enough time for the Welsh Government to look at this properly since the announcement in England"".
""I hope they find some way of allowing for inflation,"" he added.

"Mr Justice Mostyn said the game could be said to be  a legitimate sport under English law.
He has granted the Aylesbury-based English Bridge Union permission for a full judicial review of its status.
Sport England has refused to recognise the game and said it was no more a sporting activity than ""sitting at home, reading a book"".
Mr Justice Mostyn, who said he played Bridge on social occasions, heard a claim the game ought to be recognised as a ""mind sport"" that exercises the ""brain muscle"".
Kate Gallofent QC, for Sport England, said the definition of a qualifying sport was an ""activity aimed at improving physical fitness and well being, forming social relations and gaining results in competition"".
That definition is based on a European Sports Charter promoting ""a common European definition of sport"".
However, the judge was told other EU countries, including the Netherlands, Ireland and Poland, ""recognise Bridge as a sport"".
Miss Gallofent insisted: ""The starting point of the definition of sport is physical activity. Bridge cannot ever satisfy this definition.""
Mr Justice Mostyn told her: ""If the brain is a muscle, it does.
""You are doing more physical activity playing Bridge, with all that dealing and playing, than in rifle shooting.
""In 1999, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) recognised that Bridge and Chess should be recognised as mind sports.""
The judge granted the union permission to mount a full judicial review challenge to Sport England.
Contract Bridge is a complex game played by millions of people across the world in competitions and at social events.
All the cards are dealt from a normal 52 card deck for each game.
Two players from each of two teams sit opposite each other across a table and through a bidding process (auction) agree to win a number of tricks.
Suits are ranked upwards - clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades and no trumps.
If they achieve the number of tricks agreed at auction they win the game but if not they lose.
The team with the highest number of games takes the rubber.
These are the simple basic rules. At higher levels, the game includes bonus points, complex dealing and other laws.","The card game Bridge is ""arguably"" a sport and could qualify for lottery funding, a High Court judge has found."
"The visitors' centre was one of the few elements of the County Antrim prison praised in a recent damning report.
But the bus that took people between the centre and the prison stopped after the start of a new contract.
The Northern Ireland Prison Service said it has arrangements in place to ""assist people with mobility issues"".
Just before Christmas, a private company took over the running of the visitors' centre from the Quaker Service, a family support charity, and the bus service ended.
Malcolm McCormick said that has made it difficult for people to visit the jail as it is too far to walk.
He had been visiting a friend regularly in the prison, but because of his disabilities he could not drive and had to use public transport.
But when he arrived at the visitors' centre at the start of December he was told he would have to make his own way to the prison entrance.
""[The prison] is not the right access level for visiting,"" he said.
""They really don't care about people who've got disabilities, or people who have to go visit their loved ones inside.""
Until December, Mr McCormick chose a train closest to his visit, and then waited at the visitors' centre until his time slot, like many other prison visitors.
They were then taken to the main prison in a minibus, which, like the visitors' centre, was run by the Quaker Service.
But when the contract for the visitors' centre was awarded to a private company, the provision of a bus was not included in the tender.
It is about a quarter of a mile from the centre to the prison, which Mr McCormick said was too far for him and others, ""especially people with mobility problems, people with bad sight, or carrying children"".
He said although a taxi was able to drop him at the main building from the train station, he was not able to wait in the prison building itself and that the visitors' centre was the only place people could wait.
Mr McCormick felt his only option was to get a taxi all the way from Belfast, costing him ""about forty quid on each visit"".
The recent report on Maghaberry Prison was damning on almost all fronts, but it did give one area a glowing review.
It said: ""The welcoming visitors' centre continued to offer good support, including to first-time visitors who were identified.
""The bus transporting visitors between the visitors' centre, the searching area and the prison also now provided a service to and from the local Moira train station.""
Mr McCormick said the prison service needs to do more to help visitors.
Raymond McCartney, the deputy chair of the Northern Ireland Assembly's justice committee, said there should be ""compassion"" shown to prisoners' families and friends visiting the jail.
""I think it's an important service - the distance from the visitors' centre to the front gate is considerable,"" he said.
""Recently, when I was in the prison and spoke to the senior managers, they believed a solution could be brought forward.
""I would be hopeful that, perhaps in the coming weeks, that we could see a resolution to this.""
In a statement, the Northern Ireland Prison Service said: ""The contract for the visitors' centre at Maghaberry was awarded through an open and transparent procurement competition.
""The prison service will continue to work with the provider to ensure that services are in place to support relationships between families and prisoners.""",A disabled man has said his visits to Maghaberry Prison have become more difficult since changes were made to the visitors' bus service.

The questionnaire was carried out by Censuswide to coincide with Holocaust Memorial Day on Wednesday.

"This comes after the country's highest court ruled earlier this year that Mr Zuma repay some of the $23m of public funds spent on his house in 2009.
The upgrades included an amphitheatre, pool, chicken run and cattle enclosure.
Mr Zuma must now repay the money - about 3% of the total spent - within 45 days.
An anti-corruption body, known as the public protector, ruled in 2014 that Mr Zuma had ""unduly benefited"" from the non-security renovations to his rural home in Nkandla in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province.
In March, the Constitutional Court then ruled that he had violated the constitution when he failed to repay some of the money.
It gave the treasury two months to come up with a figure for Mr Zuma to repay.
The treasury says it hired two independent quantity surveyors to conduct separate investigations to come up with the figure.
The main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA), one of the parties which brought the case, welcomed the treasury's report but said it had hoped the figure would be higher.
""This sends out a clear message to those involved in corruption, especially those in the ANC, that you will be held accountable for your actions, even if you are the president,"" the AFP news agency quotes DA spokesman Mabine Seabe as saying.
What has been a long and drawn out fight between President Zuma and opposition parties seems to be coming to an end, reports the BBC's Pumza Fihlani in Johannesburg.
The Nkandla scandal has been a hotly debated subject in parliament for almost three years and has damaged the president's reputation, she says.
In April, President Zuma apologised for the controversy and said he would abide by the Constitutional Court's ruling.

"Mhairi Black won the Paisley and Renfrewshire South seat for the SNP in last month's general election.
The 20-year-old sat her final exam on Scottish politics shortly after being elected.
She graduated along with the rest of her class in a ceremony at the university on Friday.
Ms Black posted a photograph of herself in her gown on Twitter.
She wrote: ""Overwhelmed by all the messages of support. They're really appreciated. It's been a great day for everyone involved.""
Her graduation came seven weeks after being elected MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire South.
The student had yet to sit her final exam when she ousted Labour's Douglas Alexander to become the youngest member at Westminster since the Reform Act of 1832.
She won her seat by 5,500 votes after overturning former Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander's 16,000 vote majority.
The MP admitted recently that it was ""quite bizarre"" returning to university after being elected an MP.
Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland, she said: ""It was a brass neck walking into a room with people I've been studying with for years and they're all pulling their hair out applying for a million and one jobs and I'm like, 'Hi guys, how's it going?'.""
A spokesman for the University of Glasgow said: ""We would like to congratulate Mhairi Black, as we would all of our students who are graduating this summer.
""They have all worked extremely hard to earn their degrees and we wish them the very best for their future careers.""",The youngest MP in the House of Commons has graduated with a first class honours degree in politics from Glasgow University.
"The game turned after 10 minutes as Sarries prop Richard Barrington was sent off for a high tackle.
Gareth Steenson converted the resulting penalty and Jack Nowell's try gave Chiefs a 10-3 lead at half-time.
Saracens performed admirably after the break and rescued two points when Titi Lamositele was forced over the line and Alex Lozowski converted.
Sarries, who can be usurped at the top if Wasps avoid defeat against Leicester on Sunday, lost Marcelo Bosch with a head injury after just five minutes, with Steenson missing a penalty four minutes later.
But the game's controversial moment was just seconds away as Brad Barritt initially tackled Geoff Parling high, with Barrington following up with his shoulder into the head of Exeter's former England lock.
Under the new interpretation of the high tackle rules Barrington was sent off, with Barritt lucky to avoid any sanction, although he may well be cited after the game.
Exeter took advantage almost straight away as Nowell raced into the corner after an impressive one-handed catch from Steenson's perfectly weighted chip.
Lozowski - replacing the rested England fly-half Owen Farrell -  pulled three points back with a penalty, but Exeter were almost further ahead after Don Armand broke through the line on a 30-metre run, only to be excellently stopped by Chris Wyles and Michael Rhodes.
After the break, Saracens upped the tempo and did not look like a team with a one-man disadvantage - Lozowski converting a penalty as Steenson missed a similar chance to restore the lead.
Exeter's set-piece failed to function as Saracens piled on the pressure, twice going close to the Chiefs try-line before Steenson got his second penalty with 11 minutes to go.
But more Saracens pressure finally told as Lamositele was forced over late on and Lozowski added the extras to secure what, at the start of the game, seemed an improbable draw.
Saracens director of rugby Mark McCall:
""The players were incredible with how they coped and dealt with all the situations that arose, and by the end it was a game that we maybe could have won as well.
""I felt Geoff was going to the ground and Richard (Barrington) came in as the adjusting defender, and he made contact. Obviously we hope Geoff's okay.
""Today ended up being a titanic struggle between 15 and 14, but I don't think anyone wants to see those kinds of games.
""I think we need to be sensible, I'm not saying they weren't today, but we've got to be sensible with how we apply this care for players, and that's all.""
Exeter head coach Rob Baxter told BBC Radio Devon:
""The players are a little annoyed, and so they should be. Especially in the second half we've got to have a little bit of a look at ourselves and say why did we not really feel like we took the game by the scruff of the neck? Why were 14 men more disciplined than us? Why did 14 men drag that game their way?
""You've got to give Saracens a great deal of credit and in some ways I'm not sure who the red card affected the most, as in the second half it seemed to stop us playing a little bit.
""Great credit to Saracens, they showed a lot of the qualities that you want to talk about when you talk about Saracens.
""It's good if we're a little bit upset and we're burning a little bit and we want more out of games like that.""

"Kieran Davies will serve at least 19 years before being eligible for parole.
He was earlier found guilty of attacking Ashley Hawkins with a hammer and a metal bar during the murder in Scotland Street in December last year.
Davies and Mr Hawkins had arrived in the city from Wales as friends but before the attack the victim said Davies had held a knife to his throat.
Addressing Davies, 28, at the High Court in Edinburgh, Lord Boyd said: ""You have been convicted on the clearest evidence of a particularly brutal murder.
""You continue to deny your guilt and you have shown little remorse.""
The judge acknowledged that Davies had a difficult upbringing and told him: ""You have not had the chances in life that may have set you on a different path.""
But he added: ""None of that excuses or mitigates the dreadful nature of this offence.""
Davies had denied murdering Mr Hawkins on 2 December. After he was found guilty of the crime he told security staff to take him down to the cells as the judge addressed him and accused the prosecutor of framing him.
The final stage of the trial took place in the murderer's absence as Lord Boyd told jurors: ""Murder cases are always difficult. They are emotionally draining for everybody involved in it.""
Police were called to the flat in the early hours of the morning after neighbours heard banging and shouting coming from inside.
One witness said he was aware of 15 to 20 bangs and screams which had stopped by the end of the disturbance.
Police found Mr Hawkins, 32, from Barry, South Wales, dead in the flat with catastrophic head injuries.
Unemployed Davies was the only other occupant in the locked property and was found topless, wearing jogging bottoms and trainers which were extensively stained with Mr Hawkins' blood.
A Reebok top, which Davies had earlier been seen wearing, was found in a washing machine, saturated with the victim's blood, along with brain tissue.
The court heard Mr Hawkins had suffered at least 24 blows to the head, and a metal pole and broken hammer recovered from the flat could have been used as weapons in the attack.
Davies, a prisoner in Edinburgh, had also repeatedly stamped and kicked him on the head and body.
Prosecutor David Taylor had told jurors: ""When police came into that locked flat there were two people there _ one alive, covered in blood and one dead, violently murdered. There is no mystery in this case.""
Davies told police that he had taken valium and claimed that he also taken heroin and ecstasy. A blood test later proved negative for ecstasy and opiate drugs but gave an indication that he had taken diazepam and cannabis.
Davies claimed he was unconscious at the time of the killing.
Defence counsel Keith Stewart QC, said: ""He maintains his position that he does not remember anything that happened in the flat.""
He asked the judge to deal with Davies on the basis that the murder was not a premeditated crime.
He earlier told the court that previously consideration had been given to Davies' fitness to stand trial and a psychiatrist who had seen him reported that he suffered from a delusional disorder.",A man who bludgeoned his former best friend to death at a flat in Edinburgh has been jailed for life.
"Police and security services will be able to see names of sites visited in the past year without a warrant, under the draft Investigatory Powers Bill.
The science and technology Committee says its requirements are confusing, and firms fear a rise in hacking.
The Home Office said it would study the report's findings.
When she announced the draft bill last year, Theresa May stressed that the authorities would not be able to see individual web pages visited, just basic data, such as domain names like bbc.co.uk or facebook.com.
But tech firms have told MPs it may not be possible to separate out data in that way and the plans were not clear about was meant by ""internet connection records"".
Committee chairman Nicola Blackwood said: ""There remain questions about the feasibility of collecting and storing internet connection records (ICRs), including concerns about ensuring security for the records from hackers.
""The bill was intended to provide clarity to the industry, but the current draft contains very broad and ambiguous definitions of ICRs, which are confusing communications providers.
""This must be put right for the bill to achieve its stated security goals.""
Mrs May insisted in January that the Home Office had been clear about what it meant by ICRs and was working closely with the industry on the legislation.
The science and technology committee also raised concerns about powers to allow spies to hack into suspects' smartphones or computers, known as ""equipment interference"".
Ms Blackwood said the technique may ""occasionally be necessary"", but added: ""The tech industry has legitimate concerns about the reaction of their customers to the possibility that electronic devices could be hacked by the security services.""
There are also concerns, expressed by Apple and other tech giants, that the bill will force them to adopt weaker encryption standards.
Some products, such as the iPhone, allow people to communicate privately in a form that cannot be decoded, even by the company which makes the device, known as ""end-to-end encryption"".
The bill would strengthen the power to force firms to give up decryption keys so that coded messages might be read.
But Nicola Blackwood said the government had to do more to ""allay unfounded concerns that encryption will no longer be possible"".
Service providers, such as BT and Sky, are concerned about the cost of storing internet records for 12 months, something they do not routinely do at the moment.
The Home Office says the overall cost to the industry will be Â£174m over 10 years and ""reasonable costs"" will be reimbursed, but the industry has cast doubt on that estimate.
The committee said the government should make an ""explicit commitment"" to pay the full costs incurred by compliance,"" to protect smaller firms hit with demands to store records.
The Home Office said it was important companies did not suffer a commercial disadvantage and stressed there were no plans to change a long-standing position of reimbursing 100% of costs associated with data retention.
Security Minister John Hayes said: ""We are mindful of the need for legislation to provide law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies with the powers they need to deal with the serious threats to our country in the modern age, subject to strict safeguards and world-leading oversight arrangements.""
The government's final proposals will be set out in the spring.","The home secretary's plan to force internet service providers to store everyone's internet activity is vague and confusing, says a committee of MPs."

Eli Walker finished a slick Ospreys move for the opening try, before Rory Hughes' score put Glasgow 13-10 up at half-time.
Sam Davies' boot kept Ospreys in touch but Ryan Grant's controversial try restored the visitors' lead.
Ospreys levelled again with Dan Evans' incisive score and Davies missed a late chance to win the game as his drop-goal attempt sailed wide.
The hosts stay seventh in the Pro12 table, while Glasgow reclaim eighth spot from Cardiff Blues.
Buoyed by a European Champions Cup win against Racing 92 in their last outing, Glasgow made a strong start and led 6-0 thanks to two Duncan Weir penalties.
Ospreys responded first with a Davies penalty and then a smartly worked try from a line-out move, which culminated in a pop pass from centre Josh Matavesi to wing Walker, who sped over unopposed.
There was also deft handling in Glasgow's opening score, with lock Leone Nakarawa offloading brilliantly for wing Hughes to touch down in the corner.
A second Davies penalty brought Ospreys level at 13-13 early in the second half, but Glasgow soon restored their lead with a contentious try.
Referee Peter Fitzgibbon consulted television match official Jon Mason and, although there appeared to be a double movement from back row Ryan Wilson, the score was awarded as prop Grant plunged over from close range.
Ospreys equalised for the second time with 10 minutes left to set up a tense finale, with Davies' break and offload setting up full-back Evans to cross for their second try.
Davies had an opportunity to put the hosts in front three minutes later but pulled his drop-goal wide.

"It was the sixth Olympic gold and 10th medal overall for the 33-year-old.
She finished in one hour 11 minutes and 5.2 seconds to lead home a Norwegian clean sweep with Therese Johaug in silver, 2.6 seconds back and Kristin Stoermer Steira winning bronze.
""It's incredible. I thought it would be hard but I've felt good,"" she said.
""I knew that I am stronger in the sprints, so I was waiting for them to attack on the last climb.
Bjoergen's gold saw her match the six golds won by Russian cross-country skier Lyubov Egorova, who also won three silvers over her career, and former Soviet speed skater Lidia Skoblikova.
She also matches the 10 medals won by fellow cross-country skiers Stefania Belmondo of Italy and Raisa Smetanina of the Soviet Uniion and the United team, but they have won fewer golds.
Bjoergen, who won three golds in Vancouver, pulled away from Johaug heading into the stadium and sprinted clear to follow up on her wins in the 15km skiathlon and the team sprint classic earlier in the programme.
It was the first clean sweep in Olympic cross-country skiing since Vegard Ulvang led Bjorn Daehlie and Terje Langli for a Norwegian sweep in the men's 30km classic in 1992.",Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjoergen won the women's 30km mass start to become the most decorated female Winter Olympian.
"Flt Lt Jon Egging, 33, from Rutland, died when his Hawk T1 aircraft - Red 4 - crashed after a display at Bournemouth Air Show in August 2011.
A new display will open at the Bournemouth Aviation Museum which includes a model Red Arrow Hawk T1A.
It will also include a collection box for the Jon Egging Trust, a charity set up in the pilot's memory.
Museum trustee David Shore said: ""After running a Red Arrows day last August and the level of interest it generated, we decided we wanted to do something in Flt Lt Egging's memory.
""We had discussions with a model maker at last year's Bournemouth Air Show about creating a display for us.
""The display will have information on both Flt Lt Egging and the history of the Red Arrows with a collection box for any donations to the Jon Egging Trust.""
The trust helps young people with vocational and academic qualifications. Its Blue Skies Programme pairs students with role models from aviation, engineering and science.
Bournemouth Aviation Museum's display is the latest tribute in the town to Flt Lt Egging.
In August 2012, a sculpture on Bournemouth's East Overcliff was unveiled featuring three glass Red Arrows planes and stainless steel contrails to coincide with the first Bournemouth Air Show since the crash.",A new memorial will be unveiled later in honour of a Red Arrows pilot killed in a crash during an air show.
"The move earlier this year sparked widespread public and political backlash with many questioning whether the British royal deserved Australia's top honour.
It came after Mr Abbot revived Australia's honours system last year.
The new cabinet under Malcolm Turnbull is set to review the honours system.
Mr Turnbull, the new prime minister, ousted Mr Abbott from power in an internal party challenge last month.
On 26 January - Australia's national day - Mr Abbott announced he had nominated Queen Elizabeth II's husband to receive the knighthood.
He had said then that the Duke of Edinburgh's life of ""service and dedication"" should be honoured. The Queen awarded the knighthood in April.
Asked on Thursday in an interview with radio station 3AW about his decision, Mr Abbott said: ""Obviously it was an injudicious appointment.""
Australia's honours system
The move was met with scorn from many among the Australian public, who questioned the Prince's contributions to Australia and pointed out that as a British royal he was a symbol of another country.
Some media outlets called it a ""Knightmare"", opposition leader Bill Shorten called it ""anachronistic"", and Mr Abbott faced criticism from within his own Liberal party.
Mr Turnbull, who used to chair Australia's republican movement, had previously defended the honours system's revival in 2014, noting that most republics have an honours system and an order of knighthood.
But he is now said to be in favour of abolishing the system, according to Australian media reports.","Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said his decision to award Prince Philip a knighthood was ""injudicious""."
"O'Neill's tenure has yielded just one win from 13 matches.
""I strongly believe the way forward is with Michael at the helm and leading us into the Euros,"" commented Taylor.
""I really feel if he carries on then everyone will be better for that continuity. It's going to take time.""
Taylor, who is working on a short-term deal as goalkeeping coach less than two years since winning his last cap, believes O'Neill needs to stay on when his contract expires at the end of the year.

Defeats in Luxembourg and Azerbaijan in the last two World Cup qualifiers have proved particularly frustrating for the former Shamrock Rovers boss and his coaching staff.
But there is more to the story, with O'Neill working hard behind the scenes to strengthen the Northern Ireland set-up from the bottom, while also overseeing a changing of the guard in the senior side.
Talks with IFA officials will resume after Tuesday's final qualification match in Israel, and Taylor hopes they go well.
""Some of the young lads coming into the national side are not even playing club football, but we have a small pool of players and it's not as though we can go out and sign someone, so you do the best you can.
""Michael is very, very passionate. He's hurting as much, if not more, than anyone else.
""If you take the blip in Luxembourg out of it, the performances in all the other games - irrespective of the results - have been strong.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""It is a period of transition at the moment. It's a young squad and although the results haven't always come the lads have set a standard of performance - getting the win against Russia and going very close to a result against Portugal at home. The lads will learn from this campaign.""
If O'Neill does get the chance to continue his work with Northern Ireland, it is highly likely he would ask Taylor to remain part of his backroom staff.
At 42, the former Fulham and Birmingham goalkeeper is only just starting to get used to the idea of his playing days being over, but he would be keen to remain involved at club level even if he was offered a full-time role by the IFA.
""I sat down with Michael and he asked me to help out for five games. If he stays that doesn't necessarily mean I stay on, we'll have to sit down and talk.
""I had hoped to play again this season but I've had a niggle with my shoulder and it's set me back a bit.
""The coaching is something I'm very keen to progress with and there's no reason why I couldn't combine Northern Ireland coaching with a job at a club.""",Northern Ireland goalkeeping coach Maik Taylor has called on the Irish Football Association to hand manager Michael O'Neill a new contract despite the side's disappointing run of results.
"The man hid himself in the rear wheel compartment of the plane which landed at Heathrow Airport on Sunday. He was taken into police custody in London but later released without charge.
He had bruises and hypothermia from outside temperatures as low as -41C, Austrian media reported.
He survived because the plane flew at a low altitude to avoid stormy weather.
The man apparently got under a fence at Schwechat airport in Vienna and climbed into the undercarriage of the first plane he saw without knowing its destination.
The plane belonged to a sheikh from the United Arab Emirates and had been standing empty on the tarmac at Schwechat airport since Thursday.
It flew without passengers to Heathrow, where the Romanian was picked up by police and arrested for stowing away.
He could have been charged or fined or given a fixed penalty, the Metropolitan Police told the BBC. But he was cautioned and freed with no further action being taken, PA news agency reported.
The man could also have been handed to the UK Border Agency.
But it is understood that there is no immigration issue and that the agency will not seek to deport him, according to PA.
As Romania is part of the EU, the man is free to enter the UK.
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the stowaway was ""very lucky"" to be alive.
""If they don't find the right part to stow away, they can be crushed when the undercarriage comes up,"" he said.
He added: ""Because of the altitude and temperatures during the flight, there is a severe risk to them through exposure and lack of oxygen.
""If that doesn't kill them, then they could be unconscious when the aircraft descends, and that can mean that when the undercarriage opens again, they will fall out.""
According to Austrian media reports, the man just wanted to get out of Vienna and look for work.
Romania is a member of the European Union, so Romanians can travel to the UK for holidays. However, controls on Romanians working in Britain remain in place.",A 20-year-old Romanian man had a lucky escape after stowing away on a plane flying from Vienna to London.
"The club revealed the 'Story Of My Life' singer was behind the design on Monday after the poll had closed.
In the wake of the announcement some fans have criticised the club and questioned the credibility of the vote.
Doncaster Rovers say the voting process ""was all was fair and above board"".
Writing on Twitter one fan said: ""I wonder if the vote was rigged or that shirt actually won??? #drfc.""
The design for the 2016/17 away kit submitted by Tomlinson and his grandfather was one of five put to the public vote. It received 33.7% of votes while the second placed design polled 26.2% of votes.
After being announced as the winner Tomlinson told the club's website: ""I designed the kit with my granddad when I was home a few weeks ago.
""We used to go to Belle Vue together so it has always been a family affair with us and to now have a hand in next seasons away shirt is brilliant. I can't wait to see my team wearing it"".
Doncaster Rovers revealed the winning design in February, but did not say who was responsible.
At the time it said the winner would be taken to Thailand to see the first stage of manufacturing.
Fans have also raised their eyebrows at the clubs decision to give away 20 shirts signed by Tomlinson to fans who pre-order the strip.
One asked if he could receive a signed version of the new home strip, also chosen from a poll of fan designs.
Other fans however, have tweeted their support for Tomlinson's design.
A spokesperson for Doncaster Rovers said: ""The process for receiving kit designs, shortlisting and the public voting for our kit design competition followed strict legal guidance to ensure that the club adhered to competition law and that all processes were fair.
""We are aware that the result of the competition has attracted some negative feedback, but we can assure our fans that the voting process for the 2016/17 shirt designs was all was fair and above board.""
Tomlinson, who was part of a failed bid to buy Doncaster Rovers in 2014 , signed for the club as a non-contract player in August 2013 and made his debut for the side's reserve team in February 2014.",Doncaster Rovers fans have reacted angrily to One Direction star Louis Tomlinson and his grandfather winning a competition to design the football club's new away kit.
"The Financial Exclusion Committee says banks are failing the customers who need them the most, leaving the poorest to rely on expensive products.
It adds that controls on ""rent to own"" products and other high cost credit deals must be introduced urgently.
Banks should be required to have a duty of care towards their customers.
The report highlights how regulation has been successful in battling abusive practices by payday loan companies.
The government asked regulators the Financial Conduct Authority to limit the interest rates they are able to charge.
It calls for similar restrictions to be applied to other forms of high cost credit, charges for unarranged overdrafts and ""rent to own"" products.
These are products that allow customers to buy items, such as televisions or mobile phones, through rental deals which can cost as much as four or five times the normal price tag.
Debt charities say that as high cost loan companies have been pushed out, demand for credit by people in poverty has moved into other areas.
The government is urged to appoint a minister for financial inclusion who has to report annually to Parliament on progress made towards addressing financial exclusion.
Committee chair Baroness Tyler of Enfield said: ""Too many people still have no bank account or cannot get access to basic or fairly priced financial services.
""The 'poverty premium' - where the poor pay more for a range of services from heating their home to accessing credit - contributes to a vicious circle driving people ever deeper into debt and distress.""
She added that the victims of financial exclusion were ""often the most vulnerable in society - the elderly, the poor or those living with physical disabilities or mental health issues"".
""Action must be taken to ensure the financial system in this country works for all.
All too often, disabled customers are being failed by banks who are not adjusting their communications and procedures to serve them properly, she said.
The committee had been told of banks contacting deaf people by phone and sending written PIN numbers to blind people instead of using Braille, she added.
The British Bankers Association said it was already working closely with the government, the regulator and consumer advocates on a number of the areas highlighted in the report.
""We will consider the report's recommendations in detail and reflect on how they might be adopted by the industry going forward,"" it added.
Polly Mackenzie, director of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, said: ""For too long it's been assumed that when people with mental health problems get behind on bills, or struggle to stick to their budget, it's because they're lazy or incompetent.
""That's simply not true, and we are delighted to see the Lords committee recognise this and the need for banks to step up and offer support.
""It's time for banks to adapt their services to help support people when they're unwell.""","The banks and financial regulators should do more to tackle the vicious cycle of debt and overcharging, says a Lords committee."
"Following early efforts from Shaquile Coulthirst and Leonardo Da Silva Lopes, Grant McCann's side deservedly took the lead after 21 minutes with Ryan Tafazolli rising highest to nod in Paul Taylor's free-kick.
Lopes could have doubled Posh's lead just before half-time but his effort from just inside the penalty area was easily saved by Dillon Phillips.
The Addicks came out on the front foot after the break and went close through Josh Magennis, but the forward's effort ricocheted back off the inside of the far post.
To frustrate the hosts further, Jordan Botaka then saw a deflected effort loop up onto the crossbar with Luke McGee beaten in the 55th minute as Charlton searched for an equaliser.
Peterborough doubled their advantage in the 66th minute courtesy of a superb Gwion Edwards solo effort to seal an impressive away victory.

"Gail O'Rorke, 43, of Kilclare Gardens, has denied assisting the suicide of Bernadette Forde on 6 June 2011.
Ms Forde died at her home in Dublin on 6 June 2011 after being denied travel to a clinic in Switzerland.
Ms O'Rorke told police it was agreed that another friend of the deceased, Mary Lundy, would be present.
The deceased was diagnosed in 2001 with progressive multiple sclerosis and her condition was compounded by a car accident in 2008 that left her using a wheelchair.
In the police interviews, Ms O Rorke said Ms Forde had arranged for her to stay in a hotel in County Kilkenny so she would be out of the way and not be implicated in the suicide.
She said after Ms Forde's death, Ms Lundy had told her what had happened at Ms Forde's home on the evening of 5 June 2011 when she took a lethal dose of medication bought on the internet.
She said Ms Lundy had sobbed and told her it was the hardest thing she had ever done. She told her she had left the house when Ms Forde was close to death.
Ms O'Rorke told police that she and other family members and friends knew about Ms Forde's plan.
Ms Forde had received a number of visitors on the morning of 5 June and it was known that she planned to take a lethal dose of medication later that day, she said.
In her interviews after Ms Forde's death Ms O'Rorke said she, Ms Forde and Ms Lundy had ""sobbed"" after she broke the news to Ms Forde that police had intervened to prevent her travelling to Zurich to avail of the services of the organisation Dignitas.
Ms O'Rorke told police that she was personally relieved, but that relief later turned to guilt because her friend's life was falling apart.
After this, she said Ms Lundy researched other options for Ms Forde.
""I took a step back and Mary took a step forward.""
She said she did make a money transfer to Mexico but was unaware what it was for the medication that Ms Forde later used to take her life with. She said she only later found out what the package contained.
The prosecution evidence in the case has now ended.
The case is expected to last for another week.","A Dublin woman on trial for assisting a suicide told police she was not present when her friend took a lethal dose of medication, but another friend was."
"VJ Day on 15 August 1945 followed the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by atomic bombs.
On Saturday, services have been held at St John's Church in Cardiff and at the war memorial in Llandudno, Conwy.
A national service is taking place at Llandaff Cathedral on Sunday where First Minister Carwyn Jones will give a reading.
The Cardiff Branch of the Burma Star Association has held its service at St John's Church.
About 300 people joined the parade from Llandudno Pier Head to the war memorial where a drumhead service was placed.
Canon of Dr Sarah Rowland Jones, from St John's Church, said: ""The Burma Star Association was set up in 1951, and ever since we've had the veterans coming and holding a service annually.
""They're now down to single figures, only a couple of them are hail and hearty in their mid-90s and so they decided the time had come on the 70th anniversary of VJ Day to lay up their standard.
""So what we are doing today is holding a service in which the standard will be paraded as usual but at the end of the service it will be handed over to the church's safe keeping and we shall we hanging it up permanently right next to the Burma Star window so that it can be there for future generations to look at and be prompted to remember.""
The national service the following day, which is open to the public and has been organised by the Welsh government, Cardiff council and Llandaff Cathedral, will start at 15:30 BST.
Speaking ahead of the event Mr Jones said: ""We must never forget the sacrifice allied forces made for our freedoms during World War Two.
""Victory in Japan by the allied forces brought to an end six years of conflict which saw the tragic loss of so many lives and the destruction of so many communities across the world.
""Their heroics in battle, often so very far from home, will always have a special place in our hearts and it's important we remember and show our gratitude for their service.""",Commemorations have taken place across Wales to mark the 70th anniversary of Victory in Japan day.
"More than 300 male evacuees have been held for screening after leaving the Old City under an agreed ceasefire.
Talal Barazi, governor of Homs, says 111 men have been questioned and released, while 190 others are still being held.
More than 1,100 people have fled the city since Friday under a truce.
Aid organisations in Syria had hoped to evacuate more civilians on Tuesday after the ceasefire was extended by three days, but the operation was delayed by a day due to logistical reasons.
""The evacuation of civilians and delivery of food aid will continue tomorrow morning,""  the regional governor told the AFP news agency.
A truce agreed until Wednesday night could be extended if necessary, he added.
The UN human rights office says it is ""deeply concerned"" that boys and men were seized as they left the besieged area.
""It is essential that they do not come to any harm,"" said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN commissioner for Human Rights.
""We will continue to press for their proper treatment according to the international humanitarian and human rights law.""
Melissa Fleming, spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said detainees were being held at an abandoned school.
""We are monitoring the situation. We are definitely taking account of the number there and who is there,"" she said.
Meanwhile, face-to-face negotiations between Syrian government and opposition delegations in Geneva have been adjourned for the day.
A second round of peace talks was held on Monday with separate meetings between UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi and the two sides.
""The beginning of this week is as laborious as it was in the first week. We are not making much progress,"" he told a news conference at the United Nations headquarters.
The first round ended last month with no firm agreements and both sides trading insults.
The opposition wants the government to commit in writing to the 2012 Geneva Communique, which called for the formation of a transitional administration with full executive authority.
President Bashar al-Assad's government has ruled out any transfer of power.
On the ground, efforts to evacuate hundreds more women, children and elderly people from Homs, which has been under siege for 18 months, were temporarily halted on Tuesday for logistical reasons.
More than 450 civilians left on Monday, amid mortar fire and shooting.
The BBC's Lyse Doucet, who is in Homs, said it was not expected that so many young men would try to leave.
So their fate is being scrutinised very closely, our correspondent adds.
She was at a press conference on Tuesday where the Homs governor gave the latest figures on how many detainees had been released.
He said he expected around 80% of those held would be let free.
Matthew Hollingworth, Syria director for the UN's World Food Programme, told the BBC ""the floodgates have opened"" as many more people try to leave.
""The levels of destitution inside the Old City are like nothing I've ever seen before,"" he said.
""People are living in tunnels underground, moving between shells of buildings to find roots to eat - there has been little food for many, many months now.""
UN aid chief Valerie Amos welcomed the extension of a three-day truce on Monday.
Desperation of Palestinian refugees
But she also confirmed that 11 people were killed after the relief operation was ""deliberately targeted"". It is unclear who was responsible for the attack.
She said that many of those who had left the city so far appeared traumatised and weak after enduring many months of siege.
Writing in the UK's Independent newspaper, UK Foreign Secretary William Hague warned that the Srebrenica massacre of 1995 - when more than 8,000 men and boys were killed in a Bosnian town - could be repeated in the Old City of Homs.
He said it was time to ""turn up the heat"" on the Syrian government.
However, Russia and China failed to attend a meeting in New York to discuss a new UN Security Council resolution calling for greater access for humanitarian aid on Monday.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has dismissed the draft resolution as one-sided and ""detached from reality"", according to Interfax news agency.
Syria's civil conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives since 2011 and has driven 9.5 million people from their homes.",UN aid agencies have expressed concern about the safety of scores of men and boys detained by the Syrian authorities after being evacuated from Homs.
"Proposals for reform will include term limits for presidents and integrity checks for top officials, president Sepp Blatter announced.
Fifa will hold an extraordinary congress to elect its new president on 26 February 2016, he added.
Blatter, 79, announced he would stand down in June - just four days after being re-elected president.
Blatter's resignation on 2 June followed the arrest of seven Fifa officials as part of a United States investigation that saw 14 people in total indicted on corruption charges.
A second criminal case was launched by Swiss prosecutors into the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, to be held in Russia and Qatar respectively.
They followed a number of scandals and corruption allegations that had tainted Fifa in recent years. In December, independent investigator Michael Garcia quit Fifa in protest at the way it handled his report into bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
Candidates to replace Blatter in the February election must be nominated before 26 October.
Initial predictions were of a December election, as favoured by several regional football confederations.
By the time of the vote, Blatter will have been in office for almost nine months from the date of his 2 June resignation speech.
Media playback is not supported on this device
At a news conference on Monday, he did not backtrack on his announcement to stand aside - despite appearing to suggest in June he was reconsidering - confirming: ""On 26 of February, Fifa will have a new president. I will not be a candidate for the election in 2016.""
Explaining his decision to step down, he said: ""I had to do something very special and I did it. In footballing terms I would say I kicked the ball out of the field to stop something, this is what I did on 2 June. I'm still the elected president and today I speak with you as the elected president.""
Earlier on Monday, Prince Ali bin al-Hussein - who lost to Blatter in the May election - had called for the Swiss to leave his post immediately.
""President Blatter's resignation cannot be dragged out any longer. He must leave now,"" he said.
Uefa president Michel Platini has been asked by a majority of world football chiefs to stand for the post.
It is thought 60-year-old Platini has yet to decide whether he will stand. But following Blatter's announcement, Platini said: ""We now have a concrete date which means we can look forward to new leadership, which will surely bring with it new ideas and new solutions. This is an exciting time for Fifa.""
Term limits for officials, central integrity checks for executive committee members and the disclosing of all salaries and payments to Fifa members will be the main focus of the reform taskforce, Blatter said - although he did not go into more detail.
The set-up of the committee would be like ""10 players and a coach"", he added, with one key person - the ""coach"" - driving the process.
Platini said the creation of the panel was ""an important step"". Speaking after the Fifa executive committee meeting he said: ""We must now make sure that the reforms outlined today will be undertaken in a swift and effective manner. We need to reform Fifa and we need to do it now.""
Blatter believes the steps to reform could be his legacy. He said: ""I am still the elected president by 133 associations and I will use my mandate as president in a responsibility and mission to make sure that at the end of February I can say Fifa has started to reform and to rebuild the reputation of Fifa.""
But anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, citing the fact the committee would not be fully independent of Fifa, said of the move: ""This will not be sufficient to win back trust in Fifa.""
The organisation's director of communications, Neil Martinson, added: ""Fifa has promised reform many times before and failed dismally. They have failed fans and supporters today.""
Campaign group 'New Fifa Now' have written to every Fifa executive committee member asking them to consider setting up a reform commission.
They feel the taskforce to be set up by Fifa will ultimately be ineffective and instead prove to be ""more of the same"".
""Only independent reform led by an eminent person drawing on external governance experts to review, develop and implement substantial bottom-up and top-down reforms will result in the systemic and cultural change needed within world football,"" New Fifa Now said in a statement.
""Without independent reform, the global community can have little-to-no trust or confidence in worldwide football administration and management.""
Monday's news conference to announce the decisions of Fifa's executive committee began in dramatic fashion. The start was interrupted by British comedian Simon Brodkin. Brodkin - better known by his alter ego, Lee Nelson - appeared to offer piles of banknotes to Blatter, before security intervened.
As he was led away, Brodkin threw the notes at Blatter, saying ""here you go, Sepp"".
He later went on social media, under the guise of another character, footballer Jason Bent, to declare: ""Excited to be at Fifa meeting Sepp Blatter to secure the #NorthKorea2026 World Cup.""",Fifa is to set up a taskforce of 11 people to look at reforming football's scandal-hit world governing body.

"Last week, it was the Daily Mail's turn, in a reference to Operation Midland, the investigation into allegations involving members of the establishment, it said: ""'Shambolic' VIP child sex abuse and murder inquiry to close"".
In January, the Daily Telegraph weighed in, highlighting the controversy over the commissioner's Â£65,000 Range Rover: ""Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe criticised for taking new luxury car amid police cuts row"".
And last September, in one of a number of critical articles in the Times, the Thunderer column said: ""The Met Police's record on big investigations is dreadful.""
It should come as no surprise the press highlights police failings, blunders and unusually large items of spending - that is news.
Readers are not interested in police inquiries that tick along nicely, crimes solved without fuss and senior officers who never change their car.
But over the past year or two, I have found myself asking whether the media, myself included, are giving disproportionately negative coverage to Scotland Yard.
After all, the Met's record on crime, in keeping with other constabularies, has been largely positive.
Between 2000-01 and 2014-15, the total number of offences logged by the force plunged from 994,233 to 709,174, a reduction of 29%.
Murders fell from 171 to 93 - the lowest figure since the 1970s, though it has edged up in the past nine months.
Confidence in the UK's biggest police force increased to a record level in 2014.
And, despite a number of hugely controversial cases - Stephen Lawrence, undercover policing, Mark Duggan - independent inspectors have not pressed red warning lights on the Met's performance, as they have done with some other, far smaller, forces.
In a city with a population of 8.6 million, and growing, where in some boroughs 100 different languages are spoken, and where the vast majority of police officers patrol the streets without guns, unlike New York or Paris, that is quite some achievement - even more so given the bruising budget cuts the Met has had to make since 2010.
""The Met represents all the problems the police have - on stilts,"" says the criminologist Roger Graef, an independent adviser to the force, who has made award-winning police documentaries.
""What they're trying to do is incredibly hard,"" he says, adding that over the past 20 to 30 years, Scotland Yard has slowly begun to change its culture to be more professional, less corrupt and less racist.
The force has been praised, for instance over its investigation into the killing of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, but there is undoubtedly a sense within its St James's Park headquarters that the media tend to gloss over its successes, such as:
Profile: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe
Instead, the force appears to be continually on the back foot - no more so than with Operation Midland.
The Met made a mistake by initially describing the allegations from its key witness, known as Nick, as ""true"".
It was unwise for police officers to make such a judgment at the start of an inquiry.
Indeed, Scotland Yard later acknowledged it may have given the false impression it was ""pre-empting the outcome"".
That slip, together with claims detectives have struggled to corroborate Nick's allegations and difficulties handling suspects with prominent positions in public life, has fuelled a stream of critical stories.
I remain cautious about forming a judgment on Operation Midland.
From my experience, we tend to know a lot less about ongoing investigations than we think we do.
Some of the press reports I've seen appear to have an ulterior motive - to damage fatally the reputation of Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe (more about that later).
Nevertheless, Operation Midland has - on the face of it - been at the centre of some debateable decisions, particularly with regard to Lord Bramall.
According to Fiona Hamilton, crime editor of the Times, there is ""no question"" Midland has ""major flaws"". She denies having any agenda, saying it is her job to expose failings in Scotland Yard's investigations.
""I don't think we give them an unfairly harsh time,"" she says.
""The Met has a huge amount of responsibility and power - an enormous amount of power.  That goes hand in hand with a lot of scrutiny.""
Scotland Yard's response to the criticism over Operation Midland has been to issue detailed explanations of its decision-making - there have been four such statements since September 2015.
It is a relatively new approach, similar to that deployed by the Crown Prosecution Service when a high-profile case results in no charges being brought.
Scotland Yard's latest missive, a 900-word statement about the Lord Bramall-strand of Operation Midland, arrived in an email, a kind of digital tablet of stone.
The Met believes it is the best way of getting complex messages across to the widest possible number of people, given the proliferation of TV channels, online news outlets and social media sites.
It is welcome to the extent it aids understanding, but it is rather impersonal: a ""take it or leave it"" strategy that does not encourage questioning.
In the past, it was common practice for a select group of journalists to be briefed on sensitive operations, enabling them to put events into context, develop contacts and build a deep knowledge of policing.
Since the Leveson Inquiry exposed how inappropriate some relationships between press and police were, that has largely ended.
And although there is work behind the scenes to keep editors up to speed, particularly on security and counter-terrorism, the pursuit of News of the World, Sun and Mirror journalists over phone hacking and corruption claims, together with the revelation reporters' phone records were obtained by police investigating allegations former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell called police ""plebs"" during a row in Downing Street, has only served to widen the gulf between newspapers and the Met.
""There's been a relationship breakdown,"" Hamilton says. ""There's no-one on the Met side reaching out, expressing the context of the difficulty of historical abuse investigations, the challenge they face in the light of recent history of cover-ups.""
What that appears to have contributed to is a lack of support in the mainstream press.
When a public institution seems to be in trouble - the BBC or the NHS - there are commentators, leader writers and columnists who ride to its rescue, but it is hard to find that backing with the Met.
Kelvin MacKenzie in the Sun, for example, wrote last week that Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe had become ""the most reviled police officer in recent history"".
Sir Bernard does not have the charm or charisma of Sir John (now Lord) Stevens, who received a favourable press when he led the Met.
The current commissioner is a straight-talking policeman who doesn't always appear to brook debate; he has had tough decisions to make after the lows of the Leveson report and the inquiries into sex abuse carried out by the late entertainer Jimmy Savile, some of which have angered the media and the establishment. But should he really be reviled?
This week, Sir Bernard, who is seeking to extend his five-year contract when it expires in September, is expected to set out his views on relations between the police and the media.
At times, tension between the two is inevitable, healthy even. There will always be harsh headlines and sniping from the sidelines.  The Met polices London, where the media spotlight burns the fiercest.
But if there's to be a more mature and informed debate; coverage accurately reflecting the realities of 21st Century policing; and commentary that shows an understanding of the challenges of complex inquiries, then the commissioner and his force need to open up a little more - and take further, measured, steps to rebuild trust.","Barely a day goes by without a newspaper headline condemning the Metropolitan Police or its Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe."

"Bob Pooler, chief instructor with Shropshire Aero Club, said he received a call from the actor, who was keen to rent an aircraft while he was filming the new Star Wars movie.
He said the actor had wanted to bring one of his own planes to Britain, but ran out of time before filming started.
Mr Pooler said the call, from Ford himself, came ""out of the blue"".
He said he delivered a plane from Sleap Airfield, near Wem, to Denham, close to Pinewood Studios on Sunday.
""I checked Harrison out, flew around the patch with him and made sure he was legal to fly and that's it.
""We talked about Star Wars among other movies.""
Mr Pooler, who is also a dealer for Husky light aircraft, said he had first been contacted by the manufacturer's factory a few months ago.
""To rent the aeroplanes from Sleap you have to become a member and Harrison paid his membership dues until the end of the year,"" Mr Pooler said.

"Pollster Kellyanne Conway becomes campaign manager and Stephen Bannon of Breitbart News the CEO. Paul Manafort remains campaign chairman, but analysts say he has effectively been demoted.
Mr Trump told AP the new leaders were ""terrific people... they're champs"".
Mr Trump has seen his poll ratings slip since the party conventions last month.
He trails Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton both nationally and in key battleground states.
The team shaping Trump's campaign
The latest shake-up comes just 82 days before the election.
On his website, Mr Trump said: ""I have known Steve and Kellyanne both for many years. They are extremely capable, highly qualified people who love to win and know how to win.""
The Associated Press news agency said the details of the new hierarchy were hammered out at a lengthy senior staff meeting at Trump Tower on Tuesday and that more senior appointments were expected in the coming days.
At a campaign rally in Ohio on Tuesday, Mrs Clinton said the changes would make little difference to the race.
""He can hire and fire anyone he wants... They can make him read new words from a teleprompter. But he is still the same man,"" Mrs Clinton said.
Battered in the polls, Donald Trump has shaken up his campaign yet again, but don't expect a kinder, gentler candidate anytime soon.
Many senior Republicans want him to rein in his impulsive outbursts and soften his rough edges to appeal to more voters, especially women and independents.
However, Mr Trump's appointment of Stephen Bannon, an unabashed right-wing firebrand, to lead his campaign seems to signal that more controversy is ahead, not less.
The reshuffle suggests that while he recognises a change is needed, the New York billionaire won't be the one changing.
""I don't wanna change. Everybody talks about, 'Oh well, you're gonna pivot, you're gonna' - I don't wanna pivot. I mean, you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you're not being honest with people,"" Mr Trump said.
The new appointments come ahead of the Trump team's first major TV advertisements, due to start this week.
Although Mr Manafort stays in his job, analysts say the new appointments, which come two months after campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was sacked, represent a demotion.
The Washington Post cited Trump campaign aides as saying Mr Trump respected Mr Manafort but felt ""boxed in"" by people ""who barely knew him"".
Mr Manafort, a former adviser to George HW Bush and Bob Dole, only joined the Trump campaign in March.
The executive chairman of Breitbart has himself described his role there as ""virulently anti-establishment"", views that have led the website into staunch support of Mr Trump.
An article in Bloomberg in October last year described Mr Bannon as ""the most dangerous political operative in America"" - a phrase Mr Trump's own website was happy to repeat in announcing his appointment.
He will temporarily step down from Breitbart to work on the campaign full time and is expected to lead a highly aggressive strategy.
Mr Trump has been pressed by some Republicans to tone down his fiery rhetoric in the wake of a number of controversial comments in the past two weeks and the subsequent drop in poll ratings.
But Mr Trump appears to want to stand by the campaign style that won him the Republican nomination.
He said on Tuesday: ""You know, I am who I am. It's me. I don't want to change.
""Everyone talks about, 'Oh, well you're going to pivot, you're going to.' I don't want to pivot. I mean, you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you're not being honest with people.""
Ms Conway has experience with political campaigns, having previously worked with former Vice-President Dan Quayle and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
In a Republican press release last month, Ms Conway was said to be widely regarded as ""an expert on female consumers and female voters"".
Her ability to accurately predict election results in the past has won her awards.
Mr Manafort has had a troubled week, following a report in the New York Times that ledgers in Ukraine showed he was earmarked for $12.7m (Â£9.8m) in undisclosed cash payments from the former pro-Russian government between 2007 and 2012. He denied receiving any ""off-the-books cash payment"".
The Trump team's alleged pro-Russia links have been a key issue of the campaign, and the latest allegations sparked a call from the Clinton campaign for a full disclosure.
Opinion polls since the national conventions have made grim reading for the Trump team, both nationally and in key states.
The national lead for the Democratic candidate is currently between seven and eight points, the polls suggest.
The New York Times said on Monday that no modern candidate trailing by this much three weeks after the conventions had won the election.
An opinion poll in the state of Virginia, carried in the Washington Post on Tuesday, gave Mrs Clinton a 14-point lead there.","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has overhauled his campaign team for the second time in two months, with two new leaders."
"The animals were turned back from ferries at Larne and Belfast in the run up to Christmas.
Several investigations are now under way.
Some of the animals were voluntarily surrendered to animal welfare officers. Others were returned to the premises they had come from.
A total of 760 vehicles were stopped and searched at the two ports.
The joint operation involved officials from the Department of Agriculture and the Environment and several councils.
It was mounted following concerns regarding potential illegal movements of commercial consignments of dogs.
It focused on the welfare of the animals during transport, the identification of the animals and the licensing and registration of dog breeding businesses.
In the case of dogs moving from the Irish Republic, checks were also made that they had pet passports and complied with relevant trade requirements.
As part of the investigations, information will be shared with enforcement bodies in Great Britain and the Irish Republic.

"In an interview with Mexican daily Excelsior, he called Mr Trump's rhetoric ""strident"".
He added that ""that's how [Italian fascist leader] Mussolini got in, that's how Hitler got in"".
The Mexican leader also said that Mr Trump had hurt US-Mexico relations.
Donald Trump has said that if he is elected he will build a wall along the US-Mexico border to keep migrants from crossing into the US illegally.
The Republican candidate has also insisted that Mexico would pay for the border wall, which President Pena Nieto dismissed out of hand.
He said there was ""no scenario"" under which Mexico would ever pay for such a wall.
Mr Trump, who has made the fight against illegal immigration the main plank of his campaign, outraged Mexicans last June when he called undocumented Mexican migrants ""criminals"" and ""rapists"".
President Pena Nieto said Mr Trump offered ""very easy, simple solutions to problems that are obviously not that easy to solve"".
""And there have been episodes in human history, unfortunately, where these expressions of this strident rhetoric have only led to very ominous situations in the history of humanity,"" he said.
""That's how Mussolini got in, that's how Hitler got in, they took advantage of a situation, a problem perhaps, which humanity was going through at the time, after an economic crisis,"" he added.
President Pena Nieto, who had up until now avoided commenting on Mr Trump's candidacy, insisted he would be ""absolutely respectful"" of the US political process.
His predecessors in office, however, have been more outspoken.
Former President Vicente Fox used an expletive on live television when he said Mexico would not pay for the border wall proposed by Mr Trump.
Felipe Calderon, who governed from 2006 to 2012, also dismissed the idea saying: ""Mexican people, we are not going to pay any single cent for such a stupid wall!""",Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared the rhetoric of US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to that of German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.

"None of the four nations is achieving any of its three key targets for A&E, cancer or routine treatments, such as knee and hip replacements.
All have developed plans and strategies to deal with the common challenges - rising demand, squeezes on funding and the ageing population. But each has found this winter to be particularly difficult.
Spending: £2,057 per person
Key fact: Just one hospital trust hit the four-hour A&E target in the first week of January.
The system: The NHS is split between providers of services, known as NHS trusts, and commissioners, working for clinical commissioning groups. Social care, covering care homes and help in the home, is organised by councils and is means-tested.
The story so far: The first week of January was the most difficult since the four-hour target was introduced in 2004.
The proportion of patients being treated or discharged in time fell below 78%, with nearly half of hospitals declaring major alerts because of a shortage of beds.
An estimated one in five patients ended up facing long delays for a bed after an emergency admission - double the normal rate - while ambulance crews reported problems handing over patients to A&E staff.
It comes after a gradual increase in pressures in recent years. The winters have been getting progressively worst, while the 62-day target for cancer treatment to begin following an urgent GP referral has been missed for 11 months in a row.
The number of people on hospital waiting lists for a routine operation has also been rising.
NHS bosses set out a five-year vision for the NHS, which involved a greater emphasis on keeping people well in the community. But savings also have to be made - there is a £22bn target for 2020.
This has led to the development of 44 local plans to overhaul services - some of which involve closing hospitals and cutting staff.
Spending: £2,125 per person
Key fact: 63% of A&E patients were seen in four hours over the Christmas period.
The system: There are five integrated health and care boards that run hospitals, community services and social care. The over-75s get free care in their own home if they have high needs.
The story so far: Northern Ireland has some of the worst performance figures in the UK.
During the Christmas period, the number of patients seen in four hours in A&E departments dropped to 63%.
Exactly the same proportion started their cancer treatment within 62 days, according to the latest statistics, while the numbers waiting longer than they should for a routine operation have almost doubled in the past four years.
In response to the growing pressures, ministers have already set out a new vision for the health service, which they acknowledged was at ""breaking point"".
A 10-year plan was published in the autumn, which called for greater investment in general practice as a way of coping with the rising demands on hospitals.
The plan was widely criticised for its lack of detail and costings.
It did not mention hospital closures, but there is a general consensus that Northern Ireland has too many small units and care would be better concentrated in fewer bigger centres.
Political instability in Northern Ireland, which is facing its second assembly election in less than a year, also means the budget for the next financial year has yet to be agreed.
Spending: £2,160 per person
Key fact: Scotland was the last nation to hits its A&E target - in July.
The system: The NHS is run by 14 health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils with personal care - that is help with  washing and dressing - provided free in people's homes and residential care if an individual has high needs.
The story so far: Out of all the four nations, hospitals in Scotland seem to have fared the best.
Weekly data shows four-hour performance in major units hovering around the 90% mark during January.
Much of the credit has been given to the way councils and the health service are working together.
Budgets have been pooled, encouraging a close working relationship to help get frail patients out of hospital by providing extra rehabilitation services in the community.
But most of the progress has been concentrated in and around Glasgow and Edinburgh, where over a quarter of the population lives.
Arguably, this gives Scotland an advantage, as improvements in just two regions can have a significant impact on performance.
In terms of cancer treatment, over 87% started treatment within 62 days, according to the latest figures, below the 95% target.
Spending: £2,084 per person
Key fact: 81% of patients were seen in four hours in A&E during December.
The system: The NHS is run by seven health boards that organise hospital and community services. Social care is organised by councils, which cap the cost of home care at £60 a week.
The story so far: NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall has described the pressures seen this winter as ""exceptional"".
Some hospitals have been reporting a 10% rise in admissions compared with 12 months previously, while the ambulance services said the start of the year had been the busiest on record.
The government invested an extra £50m to help hospitals deal with winter pressures and this paid for an extra 400 beds - the equivalent of one more district general hospital.
But the numbers being seen in four hours during December dropped to 81% - well below the 95% target.
And the numbers waiting over 12 hours nearly hit 2,500 - a rise of two-thirds on the same period the year before.
Wales has become the first part of the UK to redefine how it deals with 999 calls.
Instead of requiring ambulances to reach a third of calls in eight minutes, it narrowed the number of conditions needing an urgent response and now just aims for this in abut 5% of cases.
Ambulance bosses say this has allowed the service to use its fleet more effectively, which means the most life-threatening cases are getting quicker treatment.
Over 86% of patients given an urgent GP referral get cancer treatment within 62-days - some way short of the 95% target.

"The National Records of Scotland (NRS) figures showed an increase of 31,700 (0.6%) people over the year to the end of June 2016.
It said the increase was due to migration, with 31,700 more people moving to Scotland than leaving.
The number of deaths exceeded births by 800, while other changes resulted in an increase of 800 people.
These other changes included variations in the prison population and in the number of armed forces personnel stationed in Scotland.

Scotland's population has increased by 6% since 1996 (when it was 5,092,190)","Scotland's population continued to increase last year, rising to a record 5,404,700."
"The bag rocks alarmingly from side-to-side and threatens to overturn.
Now, scientists have investigated this conundrum of everyday physics. Speeding up rather than slowing down can solve the problem, they say.
Alternatively, you can pivot the handle of the suitcase as close to the ground as possible.
French scientists studied a model suitcase on a treadmill to see what goes wrong when a suitcase rocks out of control at high speed.  They developed equations to explain why two-wheeled trolleys have a tendency to rock from one wheel to the other.
In cases of unstable bags - after having gone over a bump, for example - they found luggage rocks from side-to-side until it falls over, or it reaches a regular side-to-side swing.
If a regular side-to-side swing develops, going faster results in smaller swings, said the researchers.
""Thus, one should accelerate rather than decelerate to attenuate the amplitude of oscillations,"" they explained.
""A non-experienced suitcase puller would not react this way. The outcome should not be a dramatic for a suitcase, but it could be troublesome for a trailer towed by a vehicle.""
This leads on to important practical implications of the research, which is published in the journal HRoyal Society Proceedings A.
""The suitcase is a fun way to tackle the problem but the study would be the same for any trolley with two wheels or blades,"" Sylvain Courrech du Pont, of Universite Paris-Diderot, who led the study, told BBC News.
""So it will be the same for a caravan or maybe also for airplanes.""
In technical terms, the mechanical instability is mainly due to the fact that there is a coupling between the translational motion and the rotational motion of the suitcase.
It comes about because the two wheels are fixed together on a rod.
In April, scientists solved another problem of everyday physics - why shoe laces come undone.
They found the force of a foot striking the ground stretches and then relaxes the knot, while a second force caused by the leg swinging acts on the ends of the laces, like an invisible hand.
This too has practical applications for structures such as DNA.
Follow Helen on HTwitter.",It's a common experience when dashing for a train or plane while lugging a two-wheeled suitcase.
"The US Treasury said that Senat Shipping was providing ""extensive support"" to a North Korean company already under sanctions.
It means that any assets the firm holds in the US are frozen and prohibits US citizens from doing business with it.
Senat Shipping has denied the allegations.
The US Treasury makes clear that measures against Senat Shipping also extend to the company's president, Leonard Lai.
It said that Senat Shipping was co-operating with Ocean Maritime Management Company (OMMC), a North Korean firm already under sanctions.
In 2013, a ship operated by OMMC was seized by Panamanian authorities for hiding undeclared military equipment from Cuba under its cargo of sugar.
According to US authorities, Senat arranged the purchase, repair, certification, and crewing of vessels for OMMC.
""Arms shipments transported by OMMC serve as a key resource for North Korea's ongoing proliferation activities,"" said a US Treasury press release.
The United Nations and the US imposed sanctions on OMMC in July 2014 for the attempted arms import into North Korea.
Senat Shipping's statement confirmed that it had chartered OMMC vessels in the past to operate part of its business but says since then it had stopped dealing with all North Korean ship owners.
The firm denies all of the accusations brought against it by the US.
Company president Leonard Lai said the US move to put him and his company on the blacklist was ""purely based on my historical dealings with OMMC and not based on anything illegal"".
Under UN sanctions, North Korea is banned from weapons exports and the import of all but small arms. There are also separate US sanctions also target Pyongyang's nuclear arms programme.",The US has blacklisted a Singapore-based shipping firm over allegations it is supporting illicit arms shipments to North Korea.
"The capital side won only three of their last 10 league games to slip to ninth place last season, having begun the new year in the top three.
""Last season wasn't acceptable,"" said fit-again lock Fraser McKenzie.
""We are really looking to achieve top four. I think that is the minimum criteria this year.  We really feel we have a good enough squad to compete.""
McKenzie, 28, is enthused by the influx of new blood this summer, with three newcomers - fly-half Duncan Weir, full-back Glenn Bryce and wing Rory Scholes - starting Friday's pre-season match against Newcastle at Murrayfield, before their Pro 12 campaign begins at Cardiff Blues on 3 September.
""We have made some really good signings who have bedded in well and quickly,"" McKenzie noted.
""Competition for places is at a maximum at the moment and it is all looking really positive for this season.""
Edinburgh managing director Jonny Petrie revealed on Thursday that one more new player is set to arrive ""at the start of next week"".
But along with McKenzie, who missed the second half of last season after an operation to remove a disc in his neck, the return of fellow lock Grant Gilchrist is akin to another new signing.
The 26-year-old suffered a second broken arm in February in his first game for the club since October 2014, when his first arm fracture occurred.
""He was in a bad position but how he has come back from his injuries is really impressive,"" said McKenzie, who spent the latter part of his own rehabilitation programme working with Gilchrist.
""Grant has been made joint-captain (with hooker Stuart McInally) and has a unique set of leadership skills.
""He is very good at encouraging his team-mates but he is also an incredibly big man, a tall guy with good line-out and aerial ability.
""He is an 80-minute rugby player, even though he is big, with good fitness and skill levels - he has a hell of a lot of ability to push further forward. He was in the mix to be Scotland captain before his injuries and has the ability to get back to that sort of level.""
Gilchrist, a target for French club Toulon before agreeing a new one-year deal, is one of several internationals - alongside prop WP Nel and flanker John Hardie - who are likely to be subject of interest from England and France with their contracts up at the end of the season.
While acknowledging Edinburgh ""don't necessarily have the financial firepower to operate at the top end of the market"", Petrie remains optimistic of retaining the club's leading lights.
""WP [Nel] is one of the most dominant tight-heads in world rugby and likely to be a good candidate for the Lions as well,"" Petrie noted.
""I don't doubt there is going to be interest from other clubs across the world.
""But WP has been with Edinburgh for a few years now, he is very settled and loves playing here.
""We are going to have to work hard to keep him but hopefully we will have a positive conversation with him at the right time.""
With Glasgow head coach Gregor Townsend succeeding Vern Cotter in the national job next summer, and New Zealander Dave Rennie taking over at the Warriors, Scottish Rugby chiefs are well advanced in their planning for next season.
Although Edinburgh head coach Alan Solomons is only contracted until the end of this season, Petrie says there is no rush to decide on the 66-year-old South African's future.
""He signed a year's contract and there will be a time when we sit down and look at what goes after that, but the focus at the moment is getting the rugby under way again,"" Petrie added.
""Alan has the bit between his teeth and is determined as ever to get this club to where he thinks it should be.
""We have recruited well, we have got a pretty good squad and everyone is fully aware we need to kick on now.""","Edinburgh have targeted a top-four finish and a place in the Pro12 play-offs as a ""minimum"" target this season."
"The group sparked outrage in the western city of Wuppertal in 2014, when they approached people in orange vests bearing the words ""Sharia Police"".
They demanded that locals stop gambling, listening to music, and drinking alcohol.
The group's alleged organiser, Sven Lau, is a well-known Islamist preacher.
He is facing separate charges of supporting a terrorist group fighting in Syria.
A film of the ""patrol"" appeared on YouTube, prompting condemnation from the Central Council of Muslims in Germany, who said their behaviour was ""harmful to Muslims"".
Wuppertal's district court ruled that the seven vigilantes could only have broken the law - which was originally aimed at street movements such as the early Nazi party - if their uniforms were ""suggestively militant or intimidating"", a court spokesman said.
In this case, it found that the vests were not threatening, noting that one witness mistook the gang for a stag do.
The same court threw out the case last year, but was overruled on appeal by a higher court which felt the ban on uniforms could be applied in this case.

"The League Two club applied to build an 11,000-seater stadium - that could be expanded to hold 20,000 - on the site of Wimbledon greyhound stadium.
Merton Borough Council had recommended it for approval and councillors unanimously approved the plans.
The original Wimbledon club left Plough Lane in 1991 because of legislation requiring all-seater stadiums.
Wimbledon FC, as it was known then, shared Crystal Palace's Selhurst Park until 2003 when it was given permission to relocate about 70 miles (112km) north to Milton Keynes and was later renamed MK Dons.
Many fans protested against the move and decided to form AFC Wimbledon as a non-League club.
The side rose back to league status and currently plays at Kingsmeadow in Kingston upon Thames,
The AFC Wimbledon Supporters Trust has agreed to sell its lease at Kingsmeadow to Premier League Chelsea to help fund the new stadium.
The Plough Lane planning application that has been approved also includes 602 residential units, along with retail and commercial space and a leisure club.
AFC Wimbledon's chief executive Erik Samuelson said in a message on the supporters' trust website: ""This is an important step in a journey we started some years ago.
""We have a long way to go and many major hurdles to clear but we want to build a stadium that is embedded in the community and operate it in an inclusive way.""
The Greyhound Board of Great Britain, which grants greyhound racing licenses, said it was worried about the future of the sport in London if the Wimbledon track goes.
A spokesman said: ""Wimbledon is the last track within the M25 and we think it is important there is a track here in London, because greyhound racing is still the fifth most popular sport in this country.""",AFC Wimbledon has been given permission to build a new stadium close to its spiritual home in Plough Lane.
"A 20th-minute Ryan Curran header looked set to give Harps victory before Josh Daniels' 84th-minute goal was followed by a Rory Patterson strike on 88.
But Houston powered in a magnificent header in the first minute of injury-time to level.
Nathan Boyle missed a glorious Derry chance with the last kick of the game.
Leaders and champions Dundalk are now seven points above the Candystripes after edging a 1-0 home win over Bray on Tuesday evening.
Cork City's 1-0 win in Dublin over Bohemians keeps them four points behind Dundalk while Shamrock Rovers move above Derry on goal difference into third spot after beating Sligo Rovers 3-0.
With former Brandywell favourite Barry Molloy in fine form for Harps, the visitors were good value for their 20th-minute lead as Curran nodded into the net after a David Scully shot had come back off the woodwork.
Derry did improve before half-time with Patterson wasting two good chances and impressive Harps keeper Ciaran Gallagher also denying Ronan Curtis.
As Harps retreated into a defensive shell in the second half, Derry dominated possession but they needed the introduction of youngster Daniels to finally breach their visitors.
Daniels, who lost five members of his family including his mother and sister in the Buncrana pier tragedy in March, notched his first senior goal for Derry on 84 after good work by the impressive Niclas Vemmelund and Boyle.
Youngster Daniels then set up Patterson to strike Derry ahead four minutes later with the shot appearing to take a slight deflection.
To their immense credit, Harps refused to give up and a clever Kevin McHugh ball released Michael Funston whose cross was brilliantly headed to the net by Houston from the edge of the penalty area in the first minute of injury-time.
Inevitably, there was still time for more drama as Boyle somehow managed to side-foot wide from three yards with the goal gaping after a Vemmelund cross.

"Sylvia Bradshaw, of Fakenham, Norfolk, heard an appeal by Gamble Plant Skip Hire to find relatives of Gwendoline Harding, whose remains were found in a metal urn in one of its containers.
She had been cremated in March 1996 at West Hertfordshire crematorium.
Ms Bradshaw thanked the skip firm for being ""decent human beings"". ""They've done a tremendous thing,"" she said.

"It follows recent controversy over MLAs' expenses.
The Assembly Commission has asked IPSA, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, to update a report on the Stormont system it compiled last year.
The commission held a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matters raised over the last few days.
There was a public row between the Independent Financial Review Panel, which sets MLAs' allowances, and the Assembly Commission, which administers the expenses system.
The IPSA report of September 2015, which was leaked to BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan Show, called for changes in the way the assembly reviewed expenses claims which had initially been refused.
But the Assembly Commission, which is made up of the Speaker and MLAs from the five biggest parties, has made the point that the report, in its own words, ""did not identify any major issues of concern"".
The recommendation about the assembly's review procedure is one of a ""small number"" of recommendations which the assembly authorities say they are acting on.
The changes recommended in the IPSA report are to be added into the MLAs' handbook.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster has also left out fly-half Danny Cipriani.
Cipriani's omission comes despite the 27-year-old Sale player putting in an impressive performance off the bench in the 25-20 defeat by France in Paris on Saturday, later tweeting he was ""very disappointed"" and had done ""everything I could for the white shirt"".
Exeter's Henry Slade, 22, is named as one of four centres alongside Burgess, Saracens' Brad Barritt and Jonathan Joseph of Bath, while Kieran Brookes is picked ahead of loose-head Alex Corbisiero, who has struggled with fitness recently.
Ben Morgan is named as one of the back rows, despite having played just 40 minutes of competitive rugby since suffering a broken leg and, in the second row, George Kruis has beaten Dave Attwood to a spot in the 31.
The other players to miss out are centre Billy Twelvetrees, number eight Nick Easter, flanker Calum Clark and hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie.
Head coach Lancaster, whose side begin their tournament against Fiji at Twickenham on 18 September, admitted to shedding tears over the selection of his squad.
He informed successful and unsuccessful players of his decisions in one-to-one meetings and when asked about the emotion of the talks, said: ""Just by me. No tantrums, just tears.""
He added ""Selection wasn't easy and it is tough to leave anyone out but it's important to stress that the players not in this group are still part of our wider squad and could come in at any point.
""It's really positive that we have such depth and options to choose from.

""With three weeks to go before we play Fiji we feel we are in good shape as we head into next Saturday's game against Ireland.""
England backs coach Andy Farrell, who himself converted from rugby league to play in the 2007 World Cup with England, said of Burgess: ""To force our hand to put him into the squad, he should be unbelievably proud of himself.""
However, earlier this week, former England captain Will Carling said that Burgess should not be taken to the World Cup after frequently being caught out of position against France.
""There is no-one I have spoken to who I respect - ex-players, coaches - who thinks he's ready,"" said Carling, who won 72 caps for England and led them to the 1991 World Cup final.
""I don't understand what the rush is and it's unfair on him. I feel sorry for him. If he wants to make it in union, there's plenty of time.
""He's been playing union for 10 months and half of that was in a different position to what England are playing him in.
""I don't believe he's one of the four best centres in England.""
When asked about the omission of Cipriani, who has been capped 14 times for England since making his debut in 2008, Lancaster explained he was edged out by specialist performers at both fly-half and full-back and rejected suggestions he had not had a chance to stake a claim.
""During training everyone has had plenty of opportunities to put their talent forward,"" he said.
""It's tough on Danny, he's a good player. We think he's improved but he's just lost out.""
Cipriani accepted his non-selection, tweeting a long message that said he was grateful for the time he had been given to prove himself, emphasising the good communication he had enjoyed with the coaching staff.
While he understood the reasoning behind his exclusion, he added: ""I would not be a true competitor if I said I agreed as we all believe in ourselves.
""But I had a long way to make up as the squad had been building since 2012... It's just the start of my journey. I am going to stay fit and be ready if I'm called upon.""
He ended by urging everyone to support the squad. ""Now that the call has been made let's just all get behind the team and back the 31.""

The Enschede-based club won their only Dutch League title under Steve McClaren, now the Newcastle boss, in 2009-10 but are currently third from bottom in the Dutch Eredivisie.
FC Twente said that the sanctions would ""hit hard at the heart of our club"".

"Leeds, playing under head coach Thomas Christiansen for the first time, went ahead through Phillips' smart finish.
Last season's top scorer Chris Wood then headed in for 2-0, only for Bolton forward Gary Madine to nod home.
But Phillips' tap-in quickly restored Leeds' two-goal lead, and they held on despite Adam Le Fondre's penalty.

The department's then permanent secretary, Paul Sweeney, has already apologised and accepted responsibility for what happened.
The PAC report notes that no DCAL official has ever been disciplined.
The report said the NIEC board's performance ""in key areas was extraordinarily weak"" and questioned whether all its members were fully motivated.

"From April 2015 millions of people reaching retirement age will be able to spend their pension pot in any way they want.
In effect, the move will remove the requirement on many people with defined contribution pensions to buy an annuity, a financial product that guarantees an income for the rest of your life.
The government says that the overhaul will give retirees more flexibility to do what they want with their pension savings, but Labour says this policy has the potential to be ""reckless"".
So what are the potential hidden consequences?
This scenario has been much discussed immediately after the chancellor's Budget speech, but George Osborne says that new pensioners can be trusted to organise their own finances.
Some people might decide that their pension pot, locked up during their working life, will provide a nice lump sum to use to celebrate retirement with a holiday of a lifetime, a massive party, or - as the pension minister admitted - a Lamborghini sports car.
But it will be clear to all that in doing so, they take away the option of using those savings when money is tight in retirement, especially if they underestimate how long they will live for.
The new flat-rate state pension will provide just over £7,000 a year of income to fall back on - described by the chancellor as ""generous"", but much lower than the vast majority of people are used to during their working life. At times, individuals will receive this years after they have access to their defined contribution pension pot.
In Australia, where people are already able to withdraw lump sums easily, recent evidence suggests that most retirees invest the money or use it to clear debts, but a few choose to buy holidays or cars.
Freed of the need to put their pension savings into an annuity, new pensioners may decide to use the money to invest in property instead.
Mark Giddens, partner of accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young, says: ""With pensioners no longer being railroaded into investing in annuities, they will be looking for other higher-yielding investments - that inevitably means a huge boost to buy-to-let investments.
""Unfortunately, it is often the case that the higher the yield, the higher the risk.""
There is also one other big hole in this theory. The City watchdog's recent review of annuities found that the average pension pot was only £17,700. That is hardly enough for a deposit, let alone a house or flat.
Anyone who decides to take all their money in one go will not escape the taxman.

""This [plan] gives people the key to unlock their pensions and take money out, but they must remember that there are tax implications,"" says Anne Redston, professor of law at King's College, London.
Put simply, the money will be categorised as income, and so will be subject to income tax. Anyone taking out a large amount in one go might find 40% income tax is levied on some of it.
Instead, retirees might decide to take it out in small chunks over the years, stick with an annuity, or seek advice for tax planning.
Retired people are usually top of the hit-list among con artists.
Now, it is likely that people approaching retirement will be targeted with a string of investment scams.
Rogue operators will know that catching someone just as they have access to their pension pot could be very lucrative. The advice, as always, is that a deal that looks too good to be true usually is, and that no decision needs to be taken immediately.
This Budget was dubbed as a victory for pensioners, but this new flexible arrangement will not be available to most existing pensioners at all.
The new system is planned to be introduced fully in April 2015, but only for the 320,000 or so who retire each year with a defined contribution pension pot.
Those who have already bought an annuity are receiving their annual pension income and are locked into that deal for the rest of their life.
If this annuity was bought in the past few years, the likelihood is that it was not a very good deal, because of economic conditions and monetary policy. So the recently retired may feel as though they have missed out on greater choice and better deals.
Millions of people are being signed up to defined contribution pensions, through the automatic enrolment workplace pension scheme.
It is very difficult to work out at this stage whether the changes will be better or worse for those who still decide to choose an annuity when they reach retirement.
Less demand could mean insurance companies are unable to offer such good deals, but fewer customers might mean they need to be more competitive.
""The new rules might mean that annuity companies improve the rates they offer. The excess profits made from captive customers will hopefully disappear,"" says Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown.
But Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said: ""It will likely make annuities even more expensive for those who do want to buy them.""
Annuity companies may also concentrate on offering other types of financial product for pensioners, such as bonds.
The amount of money tucked away in pension pots might not be very big - not enough, as mentioned earlier, for most to buy a property.
Yet, a significant chunk of cash could be used as a loan to grandchildren who are struggling to get on the housing ladder, or facing the cost of paying for further education.
However, as explained earlier, taking out a big chunk of money in one go will probably lead to an income tax charge for Gran and Grandad.
When you buy an annuity, your pension pot is spent on an annual income that lasts for as long as you live. The longer you live, the better value for money it is.
As a result, insurance companies selling annuities are making a calculation or bet based on how much longer they think you will live. Smokers and those with health problems can get a better deal, owing to the shorter life expectancy.
When you die the income generally ends, so cannot be claimed by your family.
Under the new rules, a pension pot can be taken as cash, become part of your estate, and be passed on to your children. However, unless it is invested in a way that avoids inheritance tax, it could push the assets left in a will over the £325,000 threshold that means inheritance tax will be levied.
Millions of people will still save for retirement in a pension organised by an insurance company. This company will have your money and will try to encourage you to use it to buy one of their products when you reach retirement.
Clearly, there is nothing wrong in that, although it might not give retirees a clear picture on whether it is a good deal. With lots of financial firms wanting to get hold of that money, there is a danger of a minority of them overstating what is being offered.
The sector is regulated, giving individuals the opportunity to challenge and win compensation if they are mis-sold a product.
The government is also making it a requirement that retirees receive some guidance from their pension company, but it is not clear whether this will be impartial or free.
The vast majority of annuity money is invested in bonds, which flows through to businesses.
If the annuities market were to collapse, then this would reduce this supply line of credit to companies, the BBC's business editor Robert Peston says.
That could make businesses more dependent on banks for credit once again.","A huge change in the way people fund their retirement is expected following the chancellor's ""pension revolution""."

"Sandwell Council has received back-to-back poor Ofsted ratings and was warned the service could be run externally.
The announcement coincides with the release of Ofsted's latest inspection report which said ""positive progress"" has been made, the authority said.
Unison said members could be balloted for industrial action if there were ""no guarantees around pay and pensions"".
Tony Barnsley, Sandwell joint branch secretary, said council staff worked hard protecting children, ""many with huge workloads"".

""It feels like a huge slap in the face really,"" he said.
""Members have already indicated about action for a ballot to strike and if we don't get the guarantees we'll be faced with little choice but to go for the ballot process.""
Councillor Simon Hackett said the council did not agree with the trust model, but accepted the decision.
The move follows a government warning last December that failing departments would have six months to improve or be taken over by high-performing councils or charities.
Sandwell's children services was rated inadequate in June last year after another poor rating in 2013, which led to two resignations at the authority - a department boss and a cabinet member.
Analysis: Rob Mayor, BBC WM Black Country Political Reporter
This isn't the first authority to have a trust appointed - councils in Slough, Doncaster and just down the road Birmingham have all gone through the same.
But this is another blow for Sandwell Council which last year said it ""struggled to see how Ofsted came to the conclusion"" that it's children's services were inadequate.
The councillor in charge of the department Simon Hackett, who's previously ruled out resigning, says he doesn't think a trust is the best way to improve services, but making it a success is his ""priority"".
Behind the scenes there are concerns about morale of staff in a department which has been under siege since an inadequate rating three years ago.
Today the council is saying everything it can to reassure them as the trust takes over.
Earlier this year, Children and Families Minister Edward Timpson announced Eleanor Brazil would be the new commissioner of children's services at the council.
She recommended appointing a trust, he said.
Mr Hackett, cabinet member for children's services, said he was disappointed with the decision and improvements had been made which were reflected in Ofsted's latest report.
He added: ""However we know there is more to do to improve the quality of social care and accept we must accelerate the pace of change. For this reason, we acknowledge intervention can help us reach the high standards we are determined to achieve.",A struggling children's services department is to be taken over by a government-appointed trust.

"Leader Leanne Wood said her party accepted the referendum result to leave the European Union, but claimed no part of the UK voted for a ""hard"" Brexit.

Ms Wood said the UK was ""still in the dark"" four months after the June vote on what the result meant.
She said Plaid accepted the High Court ruling that Parliament must give its approval for the triggering of Article 50, to formally launch the two-year process of the UK's departure from the EU.
Ms Wood said the ruling ""should not be seen as an opportunity to overturn the result"", but gave an opportunity for the 48% of voters who backed Remain ""to have an input"" and pursue a ""soft"" Brexit.
She accused the UK government of making ""nothing but contradictory statements, with comments from one minister ridiculed by another"", and claimed the Welsh Government had been ""at best incoherent and at worst utterly clueless"" in its response to Brexit.

"The tourists closed on 317-5 and, with a lot of batting to come against an inexperienced South African attack, they could still get a total that takes the home side out of the game.
However, if they do, they will have done it the hard way, because the first-day performance with the bat was below their best, with too many players getting in, then getting out.
All the talk surrounding England after their convincing win in the first Test concerned the prospect of them finding some consistency, particularly with the bat. Could they nail another good performance to put this series out of South Africa's reach?
On this first day in Cape Town, they had the opportunity to do just that after winning the toss and batting first in ideal conditions on a good pitch.
But too many of the top order - Alastair Cook, Alex Hales, Nick Compton and Joe Root - did the hard part and then got out.
England want to play freely and busily, they want to be ticking along and that is a fair enough approach.
But allied to that is the need to build a careful platform, especially when so many things are in your favour. In these conditions, four wickets down at the close would have been about right, so it can be argued that England lost one too many.
That they ended the day with the upper hand was thanks to Stokes who, after a relatively lean spell, once again showed what a fine cricketer he is with an unbeaten 74.
The Durham man is a proper all-rounder, always ready to contribute with bat and ball. If one part of his game isn't firing, then he will probably deliver with the other. On top of that, he is a brilliant fielder.
Stokes is a fierce competitor and he further demonstrated that in the way he shredded the second new ball late in the day.
South Africa had built up to that point, putting all their eggs in one basket in the hope that more wickets would come. For Stokes to then smash the ball around must have been pretty deflating.
Yes, he took a chance, but he also created his own luck. He forced South Africa to remove their catchers and go on the defensive.
It is performances like this that show Stokes to be a rarity in the world game. It's hard to think of many Test sides that have a genuine all-rounder in their ranks - Australia's Mitchell Marsh and Sri Lanka's Angelo Mathews are the only others that come to mind.
That dearth of all-rounders shows just how lucky England are to have Stokes at their disposal.
While Stokes has his career up and running, Hales is a man who is looking to do just that.
After he made his debut in the first Test in Durban, I spoke of his need to learn from his mistakes, namely a waft outside off stump and a needless big shot.
He did to some extent, making a maiden Test half-century, but there was some more uncertainty in the off-stump area.
South Africa captain Hashim Amla got it quite wrong, opting for a deep square leg instead of a third catcher in the slips, especially when Hales was edging his way through the 40s.
If I was an opposing captain, I'd use a packed off-side field to Hales and ask my bowlers to bowl a foot wide, because he will go for the ball eventually.
That being said, he's got promise because he does hit the ball so well. He has played some wonderful innings in limited-overs cricket and he deserves credit for his effort here, where he got through the first session, made 60, then was pretty blameless in edging a good delivery from Morne Morkel.
Yes, Hales has the potential to get out in frustrating ways, but he could also be very destructive for England if he finds his feet at Test level. He should be judged after this series.
The mistakes against Hales were not the only time that Amla was guilty, with the South Africa skipper again just letting things happen, allowing the game to drift.
That being said, he does have an inexperienced attack to work with, but pace bowler Kagiso Rabada impressed in only his fourth match, taking 3-74, including two wickets in two balls.
The 20-year-old has a nice action, bowls with decent pace and could be even quicker if he uses his left arm more.
It was the pace bowlers who shared the five wickets for South Africa today, but the most telling delivery may have been bowled by off-spinner Dane Piedt.
Some sharp turn fooled Jonny Bairstow, who was beaten between bat and pad and fortunate not to be bowled.
That shows this is a dryish pitch that could turn more as the game wears on. The amount of runs the side batting last would feel comfortable chasing should be adjusted down accordingly.
Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt",England were in danger of wasting a good platform on the first day of the second Test against South Africa until Ben Stokes got going late on.

"It is an important question and the public deserves a straight answer. Yet in the current heated debate it risks being both politicised and blurred by conflation with other issues like the economy, migration and policies towards Russia.
So what are the facts?
The UK is currently at threat level ""severe"", the second highest on the scale, meaning the government judges a terrorist attack to be ""highly likely"" (but not necessarily imminent).
Britain is right up at the top of so-called Islamic State's target list, along with France, Belgium, Germany and Denmark. MI5 and police estimate there to be more than 2,000 individuals living here who have sympathies with or connections to international terrorism, most of it IS-inspired.
There are two principal reasons why the UK has not yet suffered the sort of Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack (MTFA) experienced twice by Parisians last year.
One is better intelligence, the other is better borders.
That said, no-one in counter-terrorism circles is being complacent that such an attack could not still happen here.
After the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and then again after the London bombings of 2005, Britain's counter-terrorism infrastructure was reformed to break down inter-agency barriers and do away with the sort of departmental ""silos"" that, sadly, still exist in many European nations.
So Britain's MI5, the domestic security service, works closely with MI6, the external intelligence-gathering agency, GCHQ and the Metropolitan Police.
Old rivalries have largely been set aside. Yet in France and Belgium the police and intelligence agencies hardly talk to each other, they share very little.
Absurdly, for a Belgian police officer to find out what Belgian intelligence knows about a threat, he or she sometimes needs to learn it from the UK police, who learn it from UK intelligence, who learn it from Belgian intelligence.
When it comes to EU-wide counter-terrorism, national intelligence agencies are even less willing to divulge their secrets.
On borders, Britain has something that continental European countries do not: A single coastline.
British counter-terrorism officials say that because the UK is not part of Europe's Schengen open borders agreement it is considerably more difficult - though not impossible - for terrorists and organised criminals to acquire the sort of powerful automatic weapons, notably Kalashnikovs, used in the Paris attacks last November.
A senior EU counter terrorism official admitted to me last year, prior to the migrant crisis, that although the EU's external borders had been strengthened, once weapons had crossed over that border from the Balkans there was little to stop them being moved freely around Europe.
The UK's strongest intelligence-sharing and security co-operation relationships are not with Europe, although those still matter.
They are with the United States, with its massive eavesdropping and interception capabilities, and the other Anglophone so-called Five Eyes partner nations: Canada, Australia, New Zealand.
Nearly all the most important intelligence-sharing with Europe tends to be done bilaterally, country to country, rather than through any EU-wide organisation.
Britain also works closely with other partner nations like Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.",Is Britain more - or less - at risk of a major terrorist attack if it leaves the EU?

But this 7ft tall New Zealander with a sleeve of tattoos is fast becoming the star of the NBA play-offs and is even putting the league's most valuable player Stephen Curry in the shade.
Adams and his Oklahoma City Thunder side beat Golden State Warriors 118-94 in game four of the Western Conference finals on Tuesday, to lead last year's champions 3-1 in the best-of-seven series.
It was the first back-to back defeats for the Warriors this season, a team who set a new NBA record of 73 wins in the regular season.
Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant were the stars of the show for the Thunder, but even they were eclipsed by a moment of magic from Adams.
The 22-year-old, who scored 11 points and seven rebounds in the win, threw a one-handed bullet pass to Andre Roberson just before half-time.
More than 22,000 tweets were sent in an hour about Adams' baseball style throw and the player began trending on Twitter in his native New Zealand and the US.
Then there was a young fan who turned up to the game at Oklahoma's Chesapeake Arena, dressed as Adams with a fake moustache and tattoos in tribute to her hero.
Many Twitter users felt the youngster was the real star of game four and even Adams himself tweeted that it was ""absolutely amazing"".
In game three Adams hit the headlines after Warriors forward Draymond Green kicked him in the groin area, but avoided suspension.
It led to Thunder fans using the hashtag #standupforsteven in the build-up to Tuesday's game.
Adams has rarely been out of the headlines in the series. After game one he had to apologise for referring to the Warriors' players as ""quick little monkeys"".

"The Somerset Choices website, run by Somerset County Council, will see approved and vetted carers list the types of services they can offer.
The National Care Association said if listed carers fell ill or took holiday, there could be gaps in service.
Somerset County Council said steps were in place to mitigate against this.
The two-year project - which lists services on a website - has been prompted by the introduction of the Care Act 2014, which came into force in April.
By law, councils must develop new markets which can offer a range of choices for those needing care.
Nadra Ahmed, chair of the National Care Association, said: ""There is a concern over the continuity of service.
""If these are single employers with 'single' roles, if something happens to them, are we going to find people left at critical periods of time without any support?""
She said there were also issues with how well-trained the self-employed carers were.
Gareth O'Rourke, senior manager at the council, said: ""[The service] is for a group of people who have a very good understanding of their needs and a strong understanding of how they want their needs to be met.""
He added those on the register were vetted, insured and met self-employment law criteria.
According to Somerset County Council, the number of people likely to need support will rise from 2,392 in 2011, to 2,751 in 2015.
In 2011/12, about 58,300 people provided unpaid care.
It is not known how many people need care in the county as some pay for it privately and have no contact with social services.

A footbridge which crosses Leith Street is being removed as part of the project but the council, which owns the bridge, plans to store it and try to ""recycle"" it in a new location.
The development, which will keep the existing John Lewis store, will also include a cinema, which is expected to offer more art house films than the Vue multiplex at the nearby Omni centre.
Edinburgh St James is a 1.7 million sq ft city centre development and one of the biggest regeneration projects currently underway in the UK.
It will provide 850,000 sq ft of retail space, five star hotel accommodation and will deliver up to 250 new private residential apartments.
The new commercial, retail and residential district is forecast to support more than 3,000 permanent jobs.
It will link Princes Street to Multrees Walk in a series of crescents with a retail and hospitality training academy, as well as flats, restaurants and shops.
Andrew Burns, Edinburgh city council leader, said: ""The Edinburgh St James development will now be able to take a step forward with the council, Scottish government and TH Real Estate, the developer, finalising the details of this innovative funding package.
""I am delighted the council has played its part in helping unlock £850m of private sector investment at the heart of our city centre.
""Not only will it provide much needed premium retail space for the city, it will also contain 250 new homes, 30 restaurants, a multi-screen cinema and a 5 star, world class hotel.

"The men were located on Thursday on the remote Pacific island of Fanadik in Micronesia.
US Navy officials said they had been stranded for three days.
The crew aboard a US Navy plane, dispatched after the men were reported missing, spotted them around two hours into their search.
As well as the sign, the men were waving brightly-coloured lifejackets to attract attention.
The men said their vessel capsized due to a large wave a few hours after their departure from Pulap in the Federated States of Micronesia on Monday.

"The pair collided while attempting to take a catch during Sunday's T20 Blast game with Sussex at Arundel.
The match was abandoned after ambulances took them from the field.
Australia international Henriques, 28, broke his jaw in three places, while Burns, 24, had cuts around his left eye that required stitches.
Surrey announced on Twitter on Monday that the pair were ""in decent shape"".
And a further update from the club on Twitter 24 hours later read: ""More good news on the lads - Moises has now been released from hospital and will see a dental specialist tomorrow. He's improving slowly!""
Burns, meanwhile, tweeted his thanks ""to all the medical staff"" who treated the pair and his hope that his club colleague ""keeps progressing well.""
Team-mate Kevin Pietersen, who was in the field at the time of the collision, said the incident deeply affected the team.
""I kept thinking one of the guys will call. Then you think one will stop but then bang, bang. It was absolutely sickening,"" Pietersen told the Daily Telegraph.
""When those guys went down and did not move it hit some of our guys very hard.
""It was the right decision to abandon the match. We had lost two of our players, a lot of players were crying in the dressing room and it is only a game of cricket.""
Director of cricket Alec Stewart also posted a picture on Twitter of Burns smiling in his hospital bed.
Henriques, who has played three Tests, six one-day internationals and four T20 games for Australia, joined Surrey in April as an overseas player for their T20 Blast campaign.

"Shillingford, 30, and team-mate Marlon Samuels were both reported to the ICC for suspected illegal actions during last month's Test series in India.
Meanwhile, Samuels, 32, has been banned from bowling his quicker deliveries.
Shillingford's arm was found to extend more then the permitted 15 degrees for his off breaks and doosras.
Samuels exceeded the 15-degree limit for his quicker balls, but he is allowed to continue bowling his standard off breaks.
A batting all-rounder, he has played for the Windies as a specialist batsman before now, although Shillingford - a specialist bowler - now faces withdrawing from international cricket until he remodels his action.
The pair have 14 days to lodge a written appeal to the ICC, although West Indies are currently in the middle of a Test series in New Zealand.
Shillingford and Samuels both played in the first two Tests, although Samuels did not bowl.
The third Test begins in Hamilton on Thursday, with one-day and Twenty20 internationals to follow.
Both players have previously been suspended from bowling in international cricket for illegal actions.
However, they were allowed to resume bowling after undergoing remedial work and further testing.
Samuels was banned from bowling in February 2008 because his arm extended more than the permitted 15 degrees for off-breaks and quicker deliveries.
Although the Jamaican continued to play as a batsman, he did not resume bowling in international cricket until September 2011, having served an unrelated two-year suspension from cricket between May 2008 and May 2010 for passing information to a bookmaker.

The 39-year-old Somerset captain played 313 first-class matches, scoring 25,470 runs at an average of 49.55.
He hit two centuries in his final match as Somerset kept their hopes of a first County Championship title alive with a 325-run win over Nottinghamshire.
""It's a pretty special way to go out,"" Rogers told BBC Radio Bristol.
Victory took Somerset to the top of the table, although they will win the title only if Middlesex's game with Yorkshire at Lord's is drawn.

"The British Infrastructure Group (BIG) claims the tax acts directly against a policy of extending UK business links to the ""farthest reaches of the globe"".
The tax is set to rise again in April to £150 for some long-haul flights.
Opponents accused the aviation industry of wanting a ""free ride"" on air taxes.
In its report, BIG said air passenger duty (APD) should be cut by 50%, then scrapped altogether.
Grant Shapps, the former international development minister who leads BIG, said Prime Minister Theresa May needs to make good on a promise she gave on Monday to ""forge a bold, new, confident future for ourselves in the world"".
He said: ""Particularly post-Brexit, now is the time to do it.""
He added that reducing APD could provide an immediate ""Brexit dividend"" because the government would not have to wait until Article 50 is triggered to make the cut.
Britain has one of the highest air travel taxes in the world.
On economy class flights of over 2,000 miles, passengers pay £73 in tax, which will rise to £75 next year. On long-haul business class journeys, flyers currently pay £146 in duty which will increase to £150 in April.
In the report, BIG cites industry figures that show UK APD for non-economy tickets is three times more expensive than France and four times higher than Germany.
It notes that Ireland has scrapped APD completely. Also, Scotland is planning to reduce APD by 50% in 2018.
""APD has disproportionate effects on different tickets, disadvantaging flights to the Far East and especially to developing economies, where the cost of a plane ticket from London can be well over 10% tax,"" the report said.
""If the government is to act on its commitments, especially those of securing new trading partners outside the EU, it must make it as easy as possible to do business, conduct negotiations and to stimulate the exchange of people and skills.
""It cannot continue to actively make extra-European travel more expensive than it needs to be.""
Some MPs will strongly resist any attempt to cut aviation taxes.
Earlier this week, the Environmental Audit Committee said the Treasury must consider the environmental impacts of its decisions.
They are likely to point out that the biggest beneficiaries of a duty cut would be long-haul holiday makers, who might otherwise be spending their money in the UK.
Business passenger numbers are stagnant - the growth in demand is for holidays.
They will mention that aviation is already uniquely protected from efforts to cut carbon emissions: under the government's plans, emissions from motoring and home heating will have to be cut to accommodate the growth in carbon dioxide from aviation.
Critics are also likely to say that families travelling by air pay less tax per mile than car drivers, even though driving a family on holiday causes less pollution than going by plane.
They will also question whether £150 tax will really deter a company director who has forked out for a business class seat.
While the former Chancellor George Osborne exempted children under 16 from APD, the tax has continued to rise for adults.
When it was introduced in 1994, the charge was £5 on short-haul flights and £10 on long-haul travel and was expected to generate £330m a year in revenue.
APD now generates around an annual £3bn for the government.
Mr Shapps argued a sharp drop in tax revenue from implementing a 50% cut would be recovered from increased trade outside Europe.
He added that a reduction would allow Philip Hammond to ""stamp his own authority"" as chancellor in his first Autumn Statement next Wednesday since being appointed to the role.
However, Mary Creagh MP, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, said: ""Transport is the highest emitting sector of the UK economy and there are already problems with the UK meeting our fourth carbon budget which starts in six years.
""We recommend that the chancellor green check all Autumn Statement decisions, especially any change to air passenger duty which could increase airport congestion and air pollution.""
John Stewart, from pressure group HACAN, said that every year before the Autumn Statement, calls are ""trotted out"" for an end of APD.
""Every year key facts are glossed over. For the vast majority of passengers it adds just £13 to a ticket, less than the cost of  breakfast at an airport terminal.
""The aviation industry enjoys tax-free fuel.  If its fuel was taxed at the same rate as petrol for cars, airlines would end up paying much more than they do through APD.""
Labour's environment spokesman Barry Gardiner MP said: ""Aviation needs to follow the polluter pays principle.
""BIG are being disingenuous in claiming reduced tax is necessary for trade: any business committed to exporting to China isn't going to measure the cost/benefit in terms of £150 air passenger duty"".
A Treasury spokesperson said: ""We keep all taxes under review, and do not comment on speculation around the Autumn Statement.""","MPs are urging the government to halve air passenger duty in next week's Autumn Statement, saying the tax hampers post-Brexit Britain's ability to trade outside Europe."
"It's famed for its pubs, wine bars, restaurants, independent shops and craft outlets - a welcome exception to the rule that every single high street has to look much the same as every other one, complete with the predictable array of coffee shop logos, supermarket chains and the rest of the familiar 'multiples', from Land's End to John O' Groats.
But Moseley Village may soon be in Moseley no longer.
Under the new constituency ward boundaries proposed by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England, it would become part of Balsall Heath.
The centre of Erdington, including the station that bears its name, would no longer be in Erdington at all, but in Stockland Green.
Hall Green School would be in Tyseley, and time-honoured names like Longbridge, Druids Heath and even the Jewellery Quarter would disappear altogether.  Edgbaston's famous cricket stadium would no longer be in Edgbaston.
It's proof yet again that there's nothing quite like a review of local boundaries for whipping-up a storm.
Remember how passionately the late lamented Lord Bilston (formerly the Labour MP Dennis Turner) fought against the removal from the constituency roll-call of the Black Country town from which he took his title?
Now the veteran local Labour activist Steve Gove-Humphries is taking up the cudgels against 'the bureaucrats' who he clearly believes plan to drive a constitutional coach and horse through communal loyalties:
And while we're linking to websites, the Local Government Boundary Commission has one of its own.
It's open for a public consultation over these draft proposals until Monday 8 February 2016.
I predict they will be inundated.
It all stems from the Kerslake Review, published just over a year ago, in which the former head of the civil service Lord (Bob) Kerslake addressed the well-documented, and sometimes catastrophic, failings of Birmingham City Council throughout successive administrations.
Among his recommendations was that the number of councillors should be reduced from 120 to 101 and that annual elections for one third of the council seats should be replaced by all-up contests every four years. This, he concluded, would facilitate greater stability and longer-term planning.
The Boundary Commission's proposals are by far the most controversial result of his report.
The present 40 wards, with three councillors each, would be replaced by 77 wards of which 53 would have one councillor each and 24 larger ones would each have two.
The commission says it would mean greater equality for voters.
Each councillor would represent on average 7,215 voters and the present glaring disparities between larger and smaller wards would be ironed-out.
Where possible, the commission say they have tried to create single member wards. But they found some communities which were impossible to divide.
Birmingham's two main parties are both unimpressed.
The city's Labour MPs say the proposals are a distraction from the project to improve the council's performance and should be scrapped.
And the council's Opposition Conservative Group Leader, councillor Rob Alden told the Birmingham Mail: ""It is very disappointing that the commission has decided to break up historic communities like Erdington, Hall Green and Northfield which perfectly fit  two-member wards yet they have kept separate communities together.""
On this weekend's Sunday Politics Midlands, we'll be bringing together the Labour MP for Birmingham Edgbaston Gisela Stuart and the local government minister Marcus Jones, Conservative MP for Nuneaton.
Also joining our debate will be Professor Colin Mellors, who chairs the Local Government Boundary Commission for England.

"Sixty-one percent of nearly 3,000 responses agreed to a change of name, with nearly three-quarters backing Welsh Parliament as the best option.
A law to change the name is expected to pass before the 2021 election.
Presiding Officer Elin Jones hoped people would ""more fully understand the powers of the assembly and the role it plays in their lives"".
But Neil Hamilton, UKIP AM, expressed concerns over potential costs.
The assembly was given the power to rename itself under the 2017 Wales Act. Assembly members had unanimously backed the idea last July after which it was put out to public consultation.
Publishing the responses on Tuesday, Ms Jones said: ""Our role today is as a full parliamentary body, with the power to pass laws and agree taxes, and we must continue to work hard to inspire the confidence, trust and pride in the people we serve.""
Speaking to BBC Wales, Ms Jones said the Welsh Parliament name will ""reflect directly the will of the people of Wales in giving us the mandate to have the powers to create legislation on their behalf"".
""We are a parliament in all but name,"" she said.
Sixty percent of people responding to the consultation said they did not agree that the role of the assembly was well understood.
Just over a fifth of respondents - 22.6% - who responded to the survey said they strongly disagreed or disagreed with the assembly's name changing.
Legislation on assembly reforms - including the change of name - will be published by the Assembly Commission in 2018.
They will include rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of the committee system.
The commission proposes that assembly members will in future be known as Welsh Parliament Members (WPMs), in keeping with the current title of Assembly Members.
The option was the second least-favoured option according to a summary of the survey conducted for the consultation - with 11.1% of respondents preferring it over other suggestions.
Member of the Welsh Parliament was preferred by 30% while 28.4% liked Member of the Senedd.
Tory AM Suzy Davies, Assembly Commissioner with responsibility for budget and governance, said the assembly would not ""waste resources by rushing to make the change"", noting that some people responding to the consultation were worried about the cost.
She said until legislation is passed the institution will continue to be known by its current name in order to avoid confusion and to minimise cost.
There have long been calls to call the assembly a Welsh Parliament, with Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies having made the suggestion in 2012.
On Tuesday, Mr Davies said: ""The assembly has clearly evolved into a parliament, and it's only right that this is now reflected in its name.""
First Minister Carwyn Jones said: ""The name Welsh Parliament / Senedd Wales will help to enhance understanding of the assembly and reflect its status as a national parliament, on a par with the other legislatures in the UK.""
Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood also welcomed the name change, saying the assembly's stature and confidence had evolved over time.
Concern was expressed by UKIP group leader Neil Hamilton, who said: ""While the Welsh Assembly has changed as a result of tax devolution, UKIP Wales is concerned about the potential costs of a symbolic name change.""
However, when asked to clarify the party's stance on the name change, a UKIP spokesman said it was not ""totally opposed"" to it and said the concerns surrounded how much it would cost.
An assembly source said Caroline Jones, the party's commissioner, had agreed to the move as part of the assembly commission.
Assembly documents suggested costs may range from between Â£40,000 and Â£150,000.
But Heledd Gwyndaf, chair of Welsh language campaign group Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg, said the assembly would miss ""an opportunity to normalise the use of Welsh"" if it it did not choose ""Senedd"" as the only name.",The National Assembly for Wales is set to be renamed the Welsh Parliament after it was backed in a consultation.
"His plan to boost infrastructure investment was welcomed by the British Chambers of Commerce and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
Meanwhile, the Institute of Directors said his intention to renationalise the railways and to raise business taxes would undermine the UK economy.
It said business would ""make its case"".
The most positive response came from RICS.
Jeremy Blackburn, the organisation's head of policy said: ""He has raised some challenging but principled issues around the expansion of Right to Buy to private landlords; as well as providing a voice for the widely-felt dissatisfaction of privatisation in our rail sector. There is undoubtedly opportunity in his agenda around infrastructure and public spending to get Britain building, and we look forward to sitting round the table and discussing this further. ""
John Longworth, director general of the BCC, also highlighted Mr Corbyn's infrastructure plans: ""Firms will be encouraged by recent statements favouring much-needed investment in the UK's inadequate infrastructure and skills.
""We will be looking for the opposition to take a pragmatic and practical approach to business recognising that wealth creation is the necessary prerequisite for the delivery of any political objectives.""
But there was a warning from Simon Walker, director general at the IoD: ""From renationalising the railways, to raising taxes on businesses and increasing government spending, Corbyn has proposed some policies in the leadership campaign that we believe would undermine our open and competitive economy.""
Mr Walker added that business leaders were never in ""perfect agreement"" with politicians of whichever party, but that the IoD would give its views ""sincerely"" in discussions on matters such as state investment in infrastructure and excessive pay at big companies.","Jeremy Corbyn's election as Labour leader has received a mixed reaction from business, including a cautious welcome for his plan on infrastructure."

They included the first bill to strip the provider of all federal funding.

The tricks on Trump Joe Biden might be planning - in memes
In March this year, as Indiana governor, Mr Pence signed an anti-abortion bill that is seen as one of the most restrictive in the US, barring abortion in Indiana on the basis of disability, gender or race of the foetus.
Parts of that law were blocked by the courts, but not until after a social media backlash which saw women phoning or tweeting Mr Pence details about their menstrual cycles under the hash tag #periodsforpence.
There had already been a significant rise in gifts to the country's biggest abortion provider in the wake of Mr Trump's election last week.
But then over the weekend, many women went on social media to say they had made a donation in Mike Pence's name.
Mike Pence's anti-abortion stance mirrors that of President-elect Trump, who wants to cut funding to Planned Parenthood, and who has in the past said women should be punished for undergoing an abortion if it were made illegal, though he later withdrew the statement.

"Australian Border Force (ABF) said its officers would be checking for visa fraud as part of a general crime crackdown involving several agencies.
But the move sparked a social media outcry, with fears of harassment and racial profiling.
Victoria Police then said Operation Fortitude had been cancelled.
A scheduled press conference was also cancelled after about 300 people gathered in the heart of Melbourne to protest against the operation, The Age reported.
The initial statement from the ABF said a ""diverse team of transport and enforcement agencies"" would be operating in Melbourne on Friday and Saturday night.
""Officers will be positioned at various locations around the CBD speaking with any individual we cross paths with,"" said regional commander Don Smith.
""You need to be aware of the conditions of your visa; if you commit visa fraud you should know it's only a matter of time before you're caught out.""
Word of the plan spread like wildfire on social media, and there were calls for a snap protest outside the Flinders Street train station.
The ABF later issued a ""clarifying statement"" on its plans, saying: ""[We] will not be 'stopping people at random' in Melbourne to 'check people's papers' as reported in media.""
""The ABF does not and will not stop people at random in the streets and does not target on the basis of race, religion, or ethnicity.""
Police have since cancelled the entire multi-agency operation.

"International development minister Alasdair Allan claimed Brexit will cause ""immeasurable harm"" to Scotland.
He said further damage could be inflicted by limiting the number of people who can come to the UK.
The UK government said the immigration system takes Scotland's needs into account.
The Scottish government has vowed to oppose any changes to the rules which create barriers for businesses by preventing them from taking on the staff they need.
The number of people living in Scotland is projected to grow by 7% between 2014 and 2039, with 90% of the rise in the next decade expected to come from inward migration.
In a letter to the UK Home Affairs Select Committee's inquiry into immigration policy, Mr Allan said a ""key priority"" in tackling Scotland's ageing population was attracting working-age migrants to the country.
He said: ""That is why we need the UK government to deliver an immigration system that meets Scotland's needs - because we depend heavily on new Scots to support our economy and communities.
""However, net migration targets and caps are too blunt an instrument to address the complex needs of our economy.
""The UK government's focus on arbitrarily reducing net migration figures, irrespective of the value migrants bring, what skills shortages they could address or what contribution they could make, is wrong for Scotland and is harming our economic prospects.""
The UK government has already rejected a call to consider devolving immigration powers to Scotland and changing visa arrangements to encourage students from other countries to stay on north of the border after graduating.
A Scottish Affairs Committee report recommended UK ministers consider ""sub-national migration powers"" for Scotland and a tailored post-study work scheme.
The UK government response, published on Friday, stated it ""does not intend to reintroduce a general post-study work scheme for Scotland"" and stressed the immigration system is ""designed for the whole of the UK"" but takes Scotland's needs into account.","Any moves by the UK government to limit immigration could ""seriously harm"" Scotland's economy, a Holyrood minister has warned."

The English way of playing one-day cricket - nice and steady at the start, wickets in hand, have a bash at the end - last had major success 24 years ago with a run to the 1992 World Cup final.
If that was a time when the tortoise managed to keep pace with the hare, then the following 23 years saw the rest of the world accelerate past England. Those nations did so to such a degree that at times it looked as if they were playing a different sport.
Former off-spinner Graeme Swann tells a tale of how England were told that if they scored 239, they would win 72% of games.
""In the 2011 World Cup quarter-final against Sri Lanka in Colombo, we had batted to our plan almost perfectly and scored 229. Jonathan Trott got 86 in 115 balls,"" said Swann.
""Everyone said 'brilliant'. Then Sri Lanka knocked them off in 39.3 overs.""
The nadir came at the 2015 World Cup, an embarrassing exit sealed with defeat by Bangladesh, a result described as ""pathetic"" by legendary England all-rounder Sir Ian Botham.
It was thought by many than an inflexible approach and an over-reliance on statistics hampered Eoin Morgan's men in Australia and New Zealand.
Now, instead of looking at data, England see the ball and whack it out of the ground. There is a new English way, one that was born in their first completed ODI after the World Cup.
On that sunny afternoon at Edgbaston, with current assistant coach Paul Farbrace keeping the hotseat warm for Trevor Bayliss, England plundered their first ODI score in excess of 400 against a New Zealand side who had previously provided them with a blueprint on how to play the 50-over game.
""A lot has can be said for former New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, who is best mates with Eoin Morgan,"" said Swann.
""He tore up the book in and said to his team: 'Whatever has happened in the past in nonsense. It's a new game, play with freedom and your team-mates back you.' England are now playing with a similar amount of freedom.
""Morgan has taken that to the England team, Trevor Bayliss has allowed that to happen and director of cricket Andrew Strauss has separated the one-day team from the Test team. It was a blatant move that had to be made - it just took some chutzpah to do it.""
Since the 2015 World Cup, England's win ratio in ODIs of 1.75 - which is 1.75 wins for every defeat - is bettered only by world champions Australia's 2.13.
Former captain Michael Vaughan has called this team the best England one-day side he has seen, while BBC Test Match Special's Simon Hughes, the ex-Middlesex seamer, wrote in the Times that the current crop must grab their opportunity to win a global trophy in the next decade.
In the main, England's spectacular upturn has been built on a batting line-up that is as destructive, dynamic and boundary-hungry as any other on the planet.
Prior to the World Cup, England were chugging along at only 5.18 runs per over, slower than every other Test side apart from Zimbabwe and Bangladesh.
Since then, players such as Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root and Jos Buttler have bumped England along at 6.33 runs an over, a scoring rate faster than any other nation.
In the same period, six men have scored more than 500 ODIs runs at a strike-rate of better than a run a ball. Half of them are English - Buttler, Roy and Ben Stokes.
During the past 15 months, England have posted six of their eight highest totals of all time.
Twice they have passed 400, including the world-record 444-3 in the third ODI against Pakistan at Trent Bridge last month, in which Hales' 171 broke a 23-year record for the highest score by an England batsman.
Of England's first-choice top seven, Hales is one of five survivors from the World Cup, which shows it is a change of approach, rather than a change of personnel, that has sparked such a shift.
These men have not learned new shots, do not hit the ball any further than they did before, but simply have the freedom and confidence to play to the limit of their ability.
If the batting line-up has seen few changes, then the bowling attack has been overhauled.
Whereas the World Cup saw England dine exclusively on a diet of right-arm fast-medium and off-spin, new England agree with the rest of the world that variety is the spice of life.
In have come left-armer David Willey, the extra pace of Liam Plunkett and Mark Wood, along with the mystery of Adil Rashid's leg-spin.
Since the World Cup, Willey and fellow left-armer Reece Topley have the best strike-rate of all England bowlers to have taken at least 10 ODI wickets, while Rashid's 38 wickets is higher than any other bowler on the planet.
Still, it is bowling that provides England with room for improvement.
While England are not alone in conceding more runs per over since the World Cup than the year before (5.73 now compared to 5.43), their economy is still only better than four other major nations.
Before the tournament down under, England were more miserly than only Pakistan, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. That remains the case.
If that involves looking at the attack as whole, then individual numbers can also be bettered.
In the past year and a half, 27 bowlers worldwide have taken 10 wickets or more and conceded fewer than five runs per over. None is English.
Fielding is also an area where England can find further gains. Of the current squad, only Roy, Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Chris Jordan could be considered of the highest class and the latter two are not in the current strongest XI.
Even with these gains still to be made, England are currently one of the finest one-day sides in the world and would be among the favourites if a global tournament began tomorrow.
As it is, they must wait for the Champions Trophy on home soil next summer, or the World Cup, again in the UK, in 2019.
And therein lies a note of caution, for England have previously shown form between World Cups, only to be humbled on the biggest stage.
Just over a year after the 2011 World Cup, England found themselves top of the world rankings after a 4-0 home series win over Australia.
That counted for little when Michael Clarke's men were crowned world champions in the spring of 2015.
""Us getting to number one was an anomaly,"" said Swann. ""We played a lot of games at home, in English conditions and it nearly always rained before the game - our seamers had a field day.
""We were playing decent cricket, but not the new brand where anything is possible.
""We had a good team, but everyone else quickly realised that to move forward you have to throw away all the old rules.""
However, there is no reason to believe that England cannot continue on their upward curve, especially with all bar one of the current squad - Plunkett - below the age of 30.
If they do, there is the opportunity, in front of their home fans, to lay to rest some significant demons that lurk in the past of English cricket.
The first involves the Champions Trophy, where England have twice hosted the tournament and twice lost finals in agonising circumstances - to West Indies in 2004 and India in 2013.
Then comes the World Cup. In 1999, England were humiliated on home soil and in 2015 they were just humiliated.
Maybe, just maybe, at Lord's in the summer of 2019, an England captain may finally get his hands on the biggest prize in one-day cricket and end a 44-year wait.",There is an English way of doing things.
"Ironbridge Power Station, in Shropshire, opened in 1969 and became one of the UK's largest plants.
The power station was switched off on Friday afternoon, when it reached its 20,000 hours limit of generation under an EU directive.
About 130 workers are at the site, some of whom will be kept on until 2017 to help with the decommissioning process.
Updates on this story and more from Shropshire
Former engineer Mike Smith pressed the button to end production.
Mr Smith, who started at the station when it first opened and retired from Ironbridge in 1992, said it was ""a great honour"" to have been involved with the plant.
""Obviously many people will have mixed emotions today, but I'm proud to have contributed to the success of a power station which has been at the cornerstone of energy generation and has supported the careers of many members of staff for so many years,"" he said.
A mosaic designed and created by pupils from St Martin's Modern School in Oswestry in 1966, which was displayed in the main conference room, will be returned to the school.
No further decisions on the future of the site will be made until the decommissioning process is completed in 2017.
E-On chief executive Tony Cocker thanked workers at Ironbridge for keeping the power station operational for decades.
""The closure of such an iconic plant will of course be tinged with sadness having played such an important role in the community,"" he said.
""Our continued focus will be supporting those colleagues who are directly affected by today's closure.""",An historic power station has stopped generating electricity after more than 45 years of energy production.
"The vessels, found by archaeologists at Must Farm near Peterborough in 2011, have now been dated to about 1500 BC, 200 years older than was first thought.
Samples taken during the conservation process have revealed the boats to be made from oak, lime and field maple.
The vessels are undergoing a two-year preservation programme at Flag Fen.
The wooden craft are being sprayed with a special wax to stop the timbers from degrading, the same technique that was applied to the 16th Century Mary Rose warship.
It is hoped the process will reveal more about the Must Farm log boats, one of which is almost 30ft (9m) long.
Mark Knight, from Cambridge Archaeological Unit, said: ""We've been carbon dating the sediment the boats were found in to try and create a detailed chronology of the river channel that once ran from the Midlands to the North Sea.
""This will tell us when each of the boats were disposed of by the people of the time.
""What we're now working on is carbon dating the actual boats which will give us an idea of when they were constructed.
""This will then tell us how long they were in use and gives us a much greater depth to the history of the area.""
Visitors to Flag Fen will be able to watch conservators at work, with the aim of eventually putting the boats on public display in glass cabinets.
Mr Knight said: ""As we lack any texts from the time to tell us what was going on, the boats help us to better understand the levels of craftsmanship and technical sophistication of the time.
""In the future we'll be judged by the technology we leave behind and these boats are a similar marker for the people of the Bronze Age.""

"Developer Sirius Minerals wants to mine near Whitby and build a 23-mile (37km) tunnel to a Teeside processing plant.
Chris Fraser, of Sirius, said its case stood ""up to scrutiny"" and it was determined to pursue the plan.
The North York Moors National Park Authority is to consider a planning application on 30 June.
The 229-page report by the park authority does not make any recommendation about the proposed mine.
It acknowledged that there were likely to be economic benefits but said the proposal did not represent ""exceptional circumstances"".
The report said the National Park Authority's statutory responsibility was to ""conserve and enhance the North York Moors for the enjoyment of present and future generations"".
Sirius said it believed exceptional circumstances had been demonstrated and the mining was in the public interest, with environmental effects ""mitigated"".
The term ""potash"" is used to describe a range of minerals containing potassium, and the proposal is to mine polyhalite.
The mine would transform North Yorkshire's economy, Ryedale District Council and Scarborough Borough Council has claimed.
However a report published earlier this month suggested that the five-year construction phase of the mine would cost the area's tourism industry £10m a year.
The Campaign for National Parks said it hoped the authority would reject the planning application.
The decision was an ""important test of the protection afforded national parks"" and there were strong planning grounds for turning it down, it added.
Plans include a construction of a minehead at Dove's Nest Farm and Haxby Plantation about 1.6 miles (2.5km) from the village of Sneaton involving mining shafts, buildings, roads and a helicopter landing site on a 64-hectare site.",A report into a planned £1.7bn potash mine has said its economic benefits do not outweigh the harm it would cause the North York Moors national park.
"Class-A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine were among the illegal substances seized, according to the data from police in England and Wales.
There were more than 2,000 incidents dating back to 2011, suggest figures from 34 police forces.
Teachers described the statistics as a ""worry"" and the ""tip of the iceberg"".
The figures were obtained by the Press Association news agency (PA) under the Freedom of Information Act.
PA sent Freedom of Information requests to every police force in England and Wales asking how many times illegal drugs had been seized or confiscated from school premises in the period from March 2011 to the end of 2014.
The query asked for details of the type and amount of drug involved, its value, the type of school (primary or secondary) and details of who it was seized or confiscated from.
Just over three-quarters of forces replied.
Of these, 28 forces gave details of the types of drugs involved, 18 forces identified the type of school and 13 the ages of the individuals involved.
The data reveals cannabis was involved in 625 of the cases and cocaine in 27.
Other drugs confiscated included LSD, amphetamines and ecstasy.
Overall there were two cases each of heroin possession at schools in the West Midlands, Surrey and Greater Manchester, plus another in Hertfordshire.
Only four incidents involved children under 11.
An eight-year-old and a nine-year-old in Staffordshire were caught with cannabis, as was a 10-year-old girl at a Leicester primary school, while another 10-year-old in Greater Manchester was carrying £5 worth of the drug.
There were 241 incidents involving 15- to 16-year-olds and 231 incidents involving 11- to 14-year-olds.
In Greater Manchester, a 14-year-old was caught with heroin with a street value of £500, and a 16-year-old with a quantity worth £330.
Other incidents involved parents or school employees, including a school gardener in Humberside and a cleaner at a Manchester primary.
The highest number of incidents and offences in the three complete years to March 2014 was for Hampshire with 229 cases.
There were 144 incidents in Avon and Somerset and 138 in the West Midlands.
South Wales police reported 92 cases.
There was a slight year-on-year decrease in the numbers which peaked at 657 in 2011-12 and fell to 611 and 560 in the next two years, while in the period March to December 2014, there were 407 incidents.
Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said any incident of drugs on school premises was ""worrying as it will often only be the tip of the iceberg of what young people are encountering on the streets.
""Teachers and school leaders are always alert to the potential for young people being involved in drug or alcohol abuse.""
Ms Keates said many specialist programmes to help schools support and educate young people about substance abuse had been cut in recent years.","Hundreds of schoolchildren, among them a pupil of only eight, have been caught with drugs on school premises, new figures reveal."

"In 1787, the 28-year-old Robert Burns was suddenly a ""celebrity"", according to Prof Nigel Leask, regius chair of English Language and Literature at the University of Glasgow.
The 2nd Edinburgh edition of his poems had given him a quite a handsome pot of money and it had also made him famous, with the cream of Scottish society taking an interest in him.
Prof Leask says: ""He was the lion of Scottish literature, everyone wants to meet him.""
And Burns also wants to meet them, especially if they have the power to promote his work further and the cash to buy his books.
""Poets in the 18th Century depended on patronage so he tours around the gentry and nobles, really doing a bit of salesmanship,"" says Prof Leask.
Throughout 1787 Burns embarked on a series of tours, firstly around the Scottish Borders and northern England and then further afield to the west Highlands taking in Inveraray, Arrochar and dinner with Glasgow tobacco merchant George Buchanan at Arden House at Bannachra near Loch Lomond.
Later in the year he toured the Highlands during which time he stayed with the Duke and Duchess of Atholl at Blair Castle, dined with the Duke and Duchess of Gordon at Castle Gordon and visited historical sites such as the Culloden battlefield and Cawdor Castle, which featured in Shakespeare's Macbeth.
Prof Leask says that Burns seems to have had letters of introduction from Edinburgh patrons that gained him access to the upper-echelons of Scottish nobility.
""He's not overawed by his posh surroundings,"" says Prof Leask.
""It shows his amazing social versatility. He's got an ability to move in all the circles of society.
""There is a sense of how thoroughly he was in the society and culture of the late 18th Century.""
Prof Leask says: ""It slightly qualifies the image of the 'heaven-taught ploughman' who does not have formal qualifications, who is just a genius endowed by nature.
""This shows how learned he was, how much he knew.""
Prof Leask says the tours of the Highlands are also important because it was a Lowlander's encounter with Gaelic culture, the Highland culture of Scotland.
During his travels he composes songs like the Birks of Aberfeldy and discovers his east coast heritage, visiting relatives in Stonehaven and Laurencekirk.
His father's family had a strong connection to the Jacobites in the north east.
As well as mixing with the Scottish nobility there was plenty of time for the rock star antics for which Burns has become well known.
Prof Leask recounts how Burns stopped for the night at Arden House near Loch Lomond.
""He has a very convivial night of dancing and drinking and seeing the sun rise over Ben Lomond,"" says Prof Leask.
""He sets off the next day and has a horse race on the road down to Dumbarton with a Highland man he calls Donald, who is riding an unharnessed horse and Burns is riding Jenny Geddes, his old mare.
""He is determined not to be overtaken so he races and has an accident.
""It's a bit like two boy-racers on the A82 nowadays.""
The tour journals are included in the new ""Oxford Edition of the Works of Robert Burns: Commonplace Books, Tour Journals and Miscellaneous Prose"".
Prof Leask says: ""This is the first time the tours have been edited to scholarly standards and cross-referenced with his poems, songs and letters.
""It enables the reader to get a good sense of how these tours contributed to his emergence as a major world poet.""","At the height of his new-found fame Robert Burns embarked on a series of tours around Scotland, keeping company with some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in the land."
"Desmond D'Mello faces a fitness to practice hearing at the General Dental Council (GDC) next week.
In 2014, more than 22,000 patients in Daybrook, Nottingham, were recalled, with 4,500 tested for viruses.
Mr D'Mello faces 56 misconduct charges including hygiene failures and prescribing antibiotics without seeing patients.
Dental nurse Caroline Surgey - who worked with Mr D'Mello at the Daybrook Dental Surgery - faces 28 similar charges.
A spokesman for the GDC said: ""The charges in full against Mr D'Mello allege that in June 2014, he failed to maintain adequate infection control by not wearing gloves, failing to change gloves between patients and other related hygiene issues.
""It is also alleged that Mr D'Mello managed patients in an inadequate manner, including the way in which he issued prescriptions.""
This included allegedly prescribing antibiotics without seeing the patient or making a diagnosis.
The pair's hearing is due to start on 8 August and last three weeks.
Mr D'Mello was originally suspended in August 2014 over hygiene concerns. He later volunteered to stop working in the UK.
Thousands were tested for blood borne viruses and five tested positive for hepatitis C.
One of his patients, Amy Duffield, died shortly after treatment but a coroner concluded her death was not connected to the treatment.","Details of the allegations against a dentist involved in the ""biggest recall in NHS history"" have been released."
"The artwork, by US sculptor Charles Ray, will be replaced by a lamp-post at the tip of the Punta della Dogana.
The decision has angered some art lovers who argue that it shows a failure to embrace challenging, contemporary work.
But city officials say the sculpture was always intended to be temporary.
Boy with Frog, which is gleaming white and 8ft (2.5m) tall, has occupied the tip of a triangular piece of land that separates the Grand and the Giudecca canals for almost four years.
It shows a boy holding up a frog by one leg and gazing at it.
The sculptor had earlier expressed hope that his work would become a permanent ""citizen of Venice"".
""I never saw it as temporary,"" Mr Ray told the New York Times.
But some residents reportedly missed a 19th Century lamp-post, long a romantic meeting spot, which stood at the spot before.
Workers began to remove the sculpture overnight on Tuesday ready to clear the space early on Wednesday, Corriere del Veneto newspaper reported.
In its place will be a reproduction of the original lamp-post.
The old-fashioned landmark was thought to be more in keeping with the surrounding architecture, BBC Rome correspondent Alan Johnston reports.
Some animal-lovers also argued that the image of a boy holding the frog upside down was cruel, our correspondent adds.
But a piece in La Stampa newspaper criticised Venice's council, saying ""administrative cowardice"" had won out over real culture.
Defending its decision, the council said the sculpture had been considered temporary and Venice had a fine record of welcoming and exhibiting modern art.","Work has begun to take away a controversial statue depicting a naked boy with a frog in a part of ancient Venice, Italian media report."
"The monument, at White Brae, Ligoneil, commemorates three fusiliers from Scotland who were killed in March 1971.
John MacVicar, from the local Royal British Legion branch, said paint has been poured over the memorial and on wreaths that had been left by mourners.
He said vandals also tried to break the granite in the attack on Tuesday night.
The memorial was erected three years ago at the site where the bodies of teenage brothers John and Joseph McCaig, and their 23-year-old colleague Dougald McCaughey, were found more than three decades before.
Mr MacVicar, who helped raise funds to build the monument, is the secretary of Oldpark/Cavehill Royal British Legion branch.
He said he believed it was a ""sectarian hate attack"".
""This is now the fifth time the memorial has been attacked since it was unveiled in 2009.  The damage caused the last time cost in excess of Â£1500 to repair,"" he said.
Mr MacVicar claimed: ""There is absolutely no doubt that this is a further attempt by republicans to remove from history the fact that the IRA murdered three young boys, two brothers aged 17 and 18 and the third aged 23 who were unarmed and out for an off duty afternoon in Belfast in 1971 simply because they were in the British Army.""
A spokesman for the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said they had not yet received a report of the attack.
Last July, sectarian graffiti was scrawled on the memorial stone. Corner posts, and the surrounding rope were also broken.","A memorial to three soldiers murdered by the IRA on the outskirts of Belfast has been vandalised for a fifth time, a local fundraiser has said."
"Deborah Fenlon's Menos 4 trial will investigate how routine CBT could help patients regain a sense of control over difficult side effects.
Hot flushes and night sweats are experienced by about 70% of women undergoing treatment.
The trial has been funded by a Â£300,000 Breast Cancer Now grant.
Royal Glamorgan Hospital is one of six participating in the three-year project, led by Swansea University's Prof Fenlon.
Hormone replacement therapy, normally offered to women experiencing hot flushes as part of the menopause, cannot be used by women with breast cancer as it can increase the risk of their disease returning.
The scientists said although CBT was known to be effective, it was not routinely offered on the NHS for women with breast cancer and can only be given to groups by trained clinical psychologists.
During the study, half the women will receive group CBT from a specially-trained breast cancer nurse in six weekly sessions lasting 90 minutes. The other half will receive whatever support they would normally receive.
A 52-year-old teacher, taking part in the trial, said: ""I had never expected hot flushes to be quite so awful.
""Some nights I just do not sleep as the hot sweats keep me awake and then I have to work the next day as though everything's ok and it's not.""
Prof Fenlon said: ""Hot flushes and night sweats can have a major impact on women's lives; affecting their work, social life and disrupting their sleep.
""There are very few effective measures to help support women with this problem, particularly after breast cancer and proven interventions are not widely available.
""With this study we hope to show how an effective intervention can be offered more widely.""",A Swansea scientist is trialling how cognitive behavioural therapy could reduce the impact of hot flushes for breast cancer patients.

Cooke won the 2004 Giro D'Italia Feminile, plus the La Grande Boucle Féminine in 2006 and 2007 among numerous podium finishes before making history at the 2008 Games by becoming Wales' second woman Olympic gold winner.
Sir Chris [Hoy] won't mind me saying the guy crumbled for 12 months after all that success because of the change in lifestyle. He couldn't cope
Since the euphoria of that triumph, Cooke has been unable to reach the heights she previously enjoyed.
Sutton, the former Welsh cycling coach and 1978 Commonwealth Games team pursuit gold medallist, says like track cyclist Sir Chris and Sydney 2000 Games 1km time trial gold medallist Jason Queally, Cooke's performances have dipped.
""In our sport or whatever sport or whatever, if you get beat, what do you do?"" Sutton said.
""You get up the next morning, you start training again and you change because you know you have to change, but you train and you change.
""When you win - most people, they can't cope with success.
""That's not a criticism, I'm just saying it from the likes of Jason Queeley, I've seen it with the likes of Sir Chris Hoy.
""Sir Chris won't mind me saying the guy crumbled for 12 months after all that success because of the change in lifestyle. He couldn't cope.""
Cooke does not deny Sutton has a point, but points to a lack of guidance from within the sport in the wake of her Beijing triumph.
She told Wales at the Olympics: ""There were so many steps along the way where you could look at any little phase of my career and say 'I could have done that better'.
""But who was there to advise me?
""No one had ever done it before. No other British rider had become world number one.
Between 2001 and 2009, Nicole Cooke (left) won an unprecedented nine consecutive British national road race titles. However, in 2010 Emma Pooley took the honours with Lizzie Armitstead second. In 2011, Armitstead won the title ahead of Cooke. In 2012 the race was won by Sharon Laws with Cooke sixth.

""No other British rider had won a World Cup. No other British rider had won the Tour de France [La Grande Boucle Féminine], no other British rider had won the Giro D'Italia and no other British rider had become Olympic champion [or] world number one.
""So if there was a book written on how to do that, well I would have been very happy to have it.
""But there wasn't a book so I had to do the best I could and yeah, it was part of the journey.""
Even so Cooke has the chance to defend her title after securing a place in Great Britain's team for the women's road race in London.
She will be joined by Lizzie Armitstead, Lucy Martin and Emma Pooley at the Games, with Katie Colclough and Sharon Laws having been dropped from the initial squad of six.
However, Cooke is likely to be asked to sacrifice her own gold medal ambition to be a support rider.
British number one Armitstead is expected to be the team leader in the race, with the other three team members expected to ensure she is given the best opportunity possible to claim gold.
Cooke has already indicated she is willing to accept that role - known in cycling as a 'domestique' - while also retaining an ambition to be the team leader and therefore be given an opportunity to defend her title on home soil.
A decision on who will be the team leader will not be taken until closer to the race itself, which takes place on Sunday, 29 July.

"Nine Madryn Street, Toxteth, where the drummer lived until he was four, is among 271 homes which are due to be cleared under regeneration plans.
Housing Minister Grant Shapps had asked for alternative plans to be considered to renovate the homes.
The communities secretary still needs to approve the plans before demolition.
Eric Pickles is considering a request by campaigners for a full environmental assessment before the area is razed.
The street is one of several known as the Welsh Streets, which were built in the late 19th Century when there was an influx of Welsh people who came to Liverpool to work as dockers.
At a planning meeting at Liverpool Town Hall earlier, residents of the streets pleaded with the council to knock down what they called ""damp slums"" and replace them with modern homes.
Opponents of the demolition said the streets had historical importance to Beatles fans as well as potential tourist value.
The childhood homes of John Lennon - Mendips, in Menlove Avenue - and Sir Paul McCartney - in Forthlin Road - are preserved as tourist attractions supported by the National Trust.
George Harrison's Arnold Grove childhood home remains a private house.
A request for the Madryn Street house to be put under a preservation order was turned down by English Heritage last year, which ruled the property had no associations with the success of the Beatles as a group.
Liverpool City Council Leader Joe Anderson said the area was in dire need of regeneration.
He said: ""A majority of the local community have expressed support for our plans since we started consulting on this plan over a decade ago.
""They are sick of living in poky, damp infested properties. They want and deserve decent, modern homes with gardens and space for a car and are exasperated and frustrated at the delays to this scheme.""
He added: ""I pledged last year that if a developer came forward with a viable proposal to retain the Welsh Streets then we would look seriously at their plans. I am sorry to say that this has not happened.
""It is simply not fair to keep the local community in limbo any longer.
""People have been voting with their feet for years and moving away from the Welsh Streets which is why the housing market in the area has completely collapsed.""
Irene Milson, chair of the tenants' and residents' association, said of the decision to demolish the house: ""I can't explain, I really can't explain, it's jubilation.
""It's been 10 years of hard work from the start to now, I just can't put it into words.""
However Phillip Coppell, chairman of the Save Madryn Street campaign, said the fight was not yet over.
He said: ""Demolition is not a foregone conclusion. We have people waiting in the wings who are prepared to redevelop the area and refurbish so we are still hopeful.
""It is an important part of the heritage trail. There are lots of plans to demolish the whole area but we believe that we should keep not only Ringo's house but the entire Welsh Streets.""","Plans to demolish Beatle Ringo Starr's birthplace have been approved by Liverpool City Council, despite opposition from a government minister."

""I tried to play my best, but Flavia played unbelievable and I have to say congrats to her.""
Pennetta later cleared up any confusion arising from her surprise post-match announcement on court.
""I will play until the end of this year but it was my last match here in New York,"" she explained.
The new world number eight will play two tournaments in China, as well as the WTA Finals in Singapore if she qualifies, before calling it a day.

"There will be little space for civil society, no Western-style democracy and no listening to ""well-fed foreigners who have nothing better to do than to lecture us"".
Instead the message of the Plenum is that President Xi wants a rules-based system in which a cleaned-up and competent Party/state bureaucracy continues to serve the ""masses"" unchallenged.
Kleptocratic dictatorships which call themselves democratic are not thereby democratic. And the same applies to political parties which call themselves communist.
The Chinese Communist Party is an entrenched ruling party whose guiding ideology is not Marxism but national ""rejuvenation"" and whose leader is now unashamedly reaching back to the language of his imperial forbears to unite his 1.3bn citizens.
It would be easier for the world to understand if the Chinese Communist Party were to rename itself the Chinese Nationalist Party, but awkwardly that's the bunch the communists swept from power 65 years ago, so the name is forever off limits.
Make no mistake though. Xi Jinping is a nationalist leader with a nationalist credo.
In power for two years already, he has a further eight to go.
If he can reform China's economy and hold its politics together, his era may see China overtake the US as the world's largest economy in absolute terms (it has just overtaken the US on the measure which takes account of differences in the cost of living).
And by the time he leaves office in 2022, China may have built its own space station and assembled the military might to confront US strategic resolve in Asia.
This is exactly what Xi Jinping means by ""the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"".
But for China's ""great rejuvenation"" to succeed depends now on the success of enormously challenging economic reform, and that in turn depends on the resilience and flexibility of its politics.
So what are Xi Jinping's politics?
President Xi believes that China is special and different. As he puts it: ""Several thousand years ago, the Chinese nation trod a path that was different from other nations.""
Two years into his leadership, the fond hope cherished by some dissidents and Western observers that he might be a closet liberal has been completely dashed.
Since the US and China restored relations in 1979, successive US governments have argued that exposure to capitalism and globalisation would eventually bind China into the existing world order and advance the political freedoms that underpin it.
But Xi Jinping has made it clear he has no time for either. Instead he is determined to make China's internal politics fit for a very different world order.
And he is a more confident and purposeful leader than China has seen at the top since Mao Zedong or Deng Xiaoping.
The evidence suggests that Xi Jinping simply doesn't believe in Western-style liberal democracy for China.
Like many of his generation of Chinese leaders, he was dismayed by the collapse of communist rule in Moscow.
He is famously reported to have said the Soviet Union fell apart in 1991 because ""no-one had the balls to stand up for it"".
Observers often put this mindset of the Chinese political elite down to self-interest.
A threat to a Communist Party anywhere is a threat to the air of invincibility which helps the Chinese Communist Party stay in power.
But even allowing for self-interest, Chinese leaders seem to believe an unchallenged ruling party is essential to national interest.
They feel the post-communist politics of Russia has offered only negative lessons.
When they look at the colour revolutions of the former Soviet Union (Rose in Georgia, Orange in Ukraine and Tulip in Kyrgistan) or survey the aftermath of the Arab Spring overthrow of dictatorships in North Africa, or the electoral experiments which followed American interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, they see no compelling model for China to follow.
They also argue that in the reform era of the past 35 years, they have done better in meeting the needs of their 1.3 billion citizens than the world's largest democracy, India.
And the global financial crisis of 2008 and the spectacle of partisan gridlock in Washington have only increased confidence in China's brand mix of authoritarianism and nationalism.
During a visit to Europe earlier this year, President Xi observed: ""Constitutional monarchy, imperial restoration, parliamentarism, a multi-party system and a presidential system, we considered them, tried them, but none worked.""
He was referring to the period between the 1911 revolution which toppled China's last imperial dynasty and the 1949 Communist revolution.
He explained that China could not copy the politics of other countries ""because it would not fit us and it might even lead to catastrophic consequences"".
If not democracy, then what?
In the past month, the umbrella movement in Hong Kong has spectacularly reopened this question.
China's propaganda machine has worked hard to close it down again in the usual way, portraying the protest as the work of foreign hostile forces intent on stirring up ""colour revolution"" on Chinese soil.
But even the president of Taiwan Ma Ying-jeou urged Beijing to think again, arguing that democracy is not a western monopoly but a universal value, and warning that as China becomes more prosperous, its people will want more democracy.
China, he said, should ""let some people go democratic first"".
On many issues, Beijing sees President Ma as a friend of China, which makes it hard to dismiss him as just another ""colour revolutionary"".
But on the mainland, discussion of universal values is censored, along with civil society, citizen rights, judicial independence and freedom of the press.
In fact, one notable feature of Xi Jinping's politics is to close down the number of people who are allowed to discuss politics.
In the two years since he came to power, the red lines for dissent have shifted, the space for any alternative discourse has narrowed.
Many lawyers and academics who were once tolerated, even encouraged, are now in jail.
At a forum for writers and artists in October, Mr Xi made a point of applauding the work of a blogger famous for championing the ""China dream"" in contrast to the ""broken American dream"".
The politics of the China dream: a rejuvenated authoritarianism.
Mr Xi is determined to make his ruling party fit to rule.
He has embarked on the boldest anti-corruption campaign in communist history.
He is also not ashamed of being an authoritarian.
Sensing that there is no return to the idealism and sense of shared purpose of the revolutionary years, he has avoided the language of the 1950s.
Instead he is reaching further back to a public service philosophy that has its roots in the mandarin culture of the imperial civil service. Mr Xi talks of the need to ""recover new things from Chinese history and culture so that it has greater cohesive force and greater influence on the minds of Chinese people"".
For thousands of years, China's political philosophers have distilled lessons from the rich history of governing this vast and complex country.
The early communists rejected that legacy wholesale.
But Mr Xi quotes liberally from Confucius and the rest, firmly cloaking himself in the patriarchal language of his imperial ancestors to cement the legitimacy of authoritarian rule.
He is laying claim to an enduring and authentically Chinese tradition.
""We in the Communist Party are firm Marxists,"" he has said.
""At the same time, we… cannot be ignorant of the history of our own country, and we cannot belittle ourselves.
""As Chinese people have more engagement with the outside world, they have a deeper need for self-affirmation.""
Can a 21st Century China, a global power with a mobile and connected citizenry, find the answers to the challenges of of its future by closing down discussion and uniting around the playbook from its past?
This is what President Xi intends.
Certainly he is working hard at being the confident father to the nation, developing an image which is much less constrained and technocratic than his immediate predecessors.
Worth noting too the recent publication of a book of his political philosophy, Xi Jinping: The governance of China.
And almost all the proposals approved for social science research funding this year deal with the thought of Xi Jinping.
The politics of the Xi years: personality cult, nationhood and going back to China's past to shape its future.
But that recipe didn't cure the problems of the 20th Century, and the 21st is only going to be more complex. Xi Jinping may yet need revisions to his ""governance of China"".","At October's top level Communist Party meeting in Beijing, President Xi Jinping set out his vision for China's governance."
"How much wealth your parents have is likely to matter more than it did for older generations. Here's why.
It used to be the case that young adults could expect to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born earlier.
This is because incomes normally rise over time, as the economy grows.
Then we had the financial crisis of 2008.
The upshot is that today's young adults are the first generation since at least World War Two not to start their working lives with higher incomes than those born before them.
For example, someone born in the 1980s could expect a household income of £27,000 at the age of 28, compared with £28,000 for those born in the 1970s.
The figure was £21,000 for those born in the 1960s and £15,000 for those born in the 1950s.
Despite having about the same income, those born in the early 1980s are much less wealthy than those born in the 1970s were at the same age.
By their early thirties, the 1980s generation had accumulated wealth of about £27,000 each, on average.
By the time they had reached the same age, the 1970s generation had twice as much wealth on average - £53,000 each.
A large part of the explanation is that an individual's wealth is mainly made up of property and pensions - and younger adults are faring well with neither.
At the age of 30, 40% of people born in the early 1980s were owner-occupiers, down from 55% of those born in the 1970s.
Home ownership rates were higher still among earlier generations, with six out of 10 people born in the 50s and 60s owning their own homes at the age of 30.
Similarly, the Local Government Association reported in December that just 20% of those aged 25 own their own property, compared with 46% two decades ago.
The lower home ownership rate doesn't just explain why young adults have lower wealth now. It also means they are likely to be poorer as they get older, because fewer of them will benefit from future increases in house prices.
In their late twenties, renters born in the early 1980s were spending 28% of their income on housing costs.
At the same age, those born in the 1960s were spending 22% of their income on rent. Those born in the 1950s spent 13% and those in the 1940s just 10%. Part of the rising costs of renting is explained by the decline of social housing.
For today's renters, it seems likely that raising a deposit is a greater barrier to home ownership than actually paying a mortgage.
Lower interest rates mean housing costs for young homeowners have fallen and they are quite likely to be paying much less than renters relative to their incomes. Mortgage interest costs for homeowners born in the early 1980s amounted to just 15% of income.
Of course, the low interest rates that have benefitted homeowners are themselves likely to be one of the factors pushing up house prices.
The vast majority of young adults working in the private sector will never have pensions as generous as those enjoyed by their older colleagues.
This is because most employers have closed defined benefits pension schemes, which typically see employees paid a set proportion of their average or final salary when they retire.
The schemes that have replaced them are typically much less generous.
In their early thirties, fewer than one in 10 private sector employees born in the early 1980s were active members of a defined benefit scheme.
This compares with nearly four out of 10 workers born in the 1960s.
In 2015, 90% of those in defined benefit schemes received an employer contribution equivalent to 10% of their earnings or more, compared with only 13% of those in other schemes.
With stalled incomes, lower home ownership and less generous pensions, it is easy to see that young adults have little to cheer about financially.
But those older, wealthier, generations are increasingly seen as the ones likely to provide a secure future.
Of those people born in the 1970s, 75% have either received or expect to receive an inheritance.
This figure has grown steadily over the decades and has doubled since the 1930s, when just 38% of people expected an inheritance.
Our data doesn't allow us to look at those born in the 1980s or 90s, but there is no reason to think this trend has not continued.
Within each generation, most inherited wealth goes to those who are already comparatively well-off.
Among the 1970s generation, nine out of 10 people whose income is in the top 20% have received or expect to receive an inheritance.
This compares with six out of 10 among those whose income is in the bottom 20%.
Data is not yet available for those born in the 80s or 90s.
So, for all the attention on inequality between generations, family ties mean a large chunk of the wealth held by older generations is likely to flow down to younger generations.
But most of that wealth will flow to those who are already well-off, potentially widening inequality within the younger generation.
It looks like we're heading for a future where how much wealth your parents have matters more than it used to.

"A Commons committee has said official copies of Acts of Parliament should be printed on archive paper to save money.
But member David Amess, Southend West MP, told the BBC he had had ""second thoughts"" and vellum should remain.
Fellow member James Gray, MP for North Wiltshire, said switching to paper would save ""very little money, if any"".
He was late for the meeting in October when the Commons Administration Committee decided to back a call from Lord Laming that Acts of Parliament should be recorded on ""high-quality archive paper"" instead of the vellum.
It said specialised printing on vellum cost too much and top quality archive paper could last for 500 years.
Lord Laming said the ""slightly over Â£100,000 per year"" cost of vellum could not be justified, when archival paper was ""superior for print quality"". An online database of legislation is also kept.
The change must be agreed in the House of Commons, which rejected a previous bid to ditch vellum in 1999.
Now one committee member has changed his mind.
""I should have given more careful consideration to what we had been asked to decide upon. I now believe that I made a mistake in not voicing my concerns then,"" Mr Amess told BBC Sunday Politics West.
""It's very precious and is at the heart of the United Kingdom's tradition as being the mother of all parliaments.""
Paul Wright, manager of vellum manufacturer William Cowley, said he was ""gobsmacked"" at the committee's decision. He calculated the average yearly cost at nearer Â£47,000.
North Wiltshire MP Mr Gray said vellum would last for 5,000 years at least and ""can be kept in an ordinary cupboard"" while paper would require ""a new archive centre"" with environmental controls to stop it degrading.
""I can't think why it is that this committee in Parliament are thinking about changing something that's done perfectly well for 1,000 years. It's a real piece of Parliamentary history,"" he said.","An MP who backed moves to scrap Parliament's centuries-old tradition of printing laws on calf skin has admitted he ""made a mistake""."
"The band enjoyed several hit songs through the decade, the biggest of which was their cover version of Chip Taylor's Wild Thing which topped the US Billboard chart and made Rolling Stone magazine's greatest songs list.
Presley's song Love Is All Around peaked at number five in the UK charts in 1967 but was a huge hit in 1994 when Wet Wet Wet covered it for the soundtrack to the Richard Curtis film Four Weddings And a Funeral, starring Hugh Grant.
Born in Andover, Hampshire, on 12 June 1941, Presley, went to Andover Secondary Modern School.
When he first learned the guitar, Presley was inspired by skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues, folk, and roots influences - popularised in the UK by artists like Lonnie Donegan
In his 20s Presley began listening to blues bands from America, including Louisiana Red and Lightnin' Hopkins.
Presley had been working as a brick-layer and said in a previous interview it took three months for him to be persuaded to start playing music with a colleague, Howard Ginger Mansfield.
His cohort was a lead guitarist and Presley in turn borrowed a bass, before being forced to drive down to London to buy his own equipment, when he was asked to return the instrument.
Their first manager owned a building company and helped them by borrowing a van to carry their equipment around.
The Troggs formed in 1964 and, in 1965, Presley, Chris Britton, Pete Staples and Ronnie Bond were signed by Larry Page, a budding record producer who got lucky with a new band called the Ravens, who he re-named The Kinks.
After the success of The Kinks You Really Got Me, Page listened to a tape of the Troggs singing their own cover of the song and told them to come back a year later, which they dutifully did - to the day.
Lost Girl backed by The Yella In Me was released on CBS, and was regarded as a flop. According to Presley, it got a single play on Radio Luxembourg.
After that, Page came across a demo of Chip Taylor's Wild Thing, which had already been unsuccessfully recorded by a band called the Wild Ones.
Around the same time, Presley had begun writing his own songs. Speaking to Stuart Maconie on BBC Radio 2 in 2010, he said: ""I started writing on the building site when I was a brick-layer.  We needed songs and when I was brick-laying.""
He added: ""I'd finished With A Girl Like You and... in 45 minutes we had to get our gear in the studio, do the two songs and get out, because it was the end of his orchestra session and he left us only 45 minutes.""
""I mean our first album only took two and a quarter hours, how do you do that?"", Presley laughed. ""It almost takes that to play it.""
Wild Thing made number one in the US and the follow-up single With A Girl Like You reached number one in the UK Singles Chart on 4 August 1966, where it remained for two weeks.
I Can't Control Myself was also a hit in the UK peaking at two in the UK chart, although the lusty nature of the song encountered resistance from conservative radio programmers.
Love Is All Around restored them to the US Top 10 in 1968 and was their final big hit in the UK and in America.
By the mid-'70s, they had been recognised as an important influence on American punk and garage groups like the MC5 and New York band Ramones.
In 1991, they collaborated with R.E.M and recorded Athens Andover, an eleven-song collaboration, which was released in March 1992.
But it was in 1994, that one of Presley's songs would become one of the UK biggest ever selling singles when Wet Wet Wet famously covered Love Is All Around, which topped the UK chart for 15 weeks.
It was featured in the British box office smash Four Weddings And A Funeral in the same year.
""I love their version,"" Presley said to Liz Kershaw on BBC 6 Music in March 2010. ""I thought Wet Wet Wet's version was great.""
He said: ""When I heard it, they sent me a tape to see what I thought of it. I put a cup of tea to my mouth and took a swig, and it came on with those big heavy chords (we did it gently) and I spit tea all over the room. And all of a sudden he started singing and I thought ""wow!"".""
""The royalties keep on coming in,"" he added, ""It's paid all over the world. And it keeps on going. I wish someone would do With A Girl Like You.""
Presley used his royalties to fund his research into crop circles and outlined his findings in a book, Wild Things They Don't Tell Us, published in October 2002.
Asked by Maconie if he was still interested in UFO's, Presley said: ""I wasn't into it until I saw one, and then I saw two, and the moment I've seen 14 but I would say some of those are a bit iffy.""

Presley had been continuing to tour with the Troggs until he suffered a stroke in Germany in 2011.
By December, Presley went to hospital in Winchester, Hampshire.  He was suffering from pneumonia and fluid around the heart.
The musician ""reluctantly"" retired in early 2012 after being diagnosed with lung cancer, but according to the Troggs' biographer Alan Clayson, he gave the band his blessing to go forward.
Speaking about Presley's cancer, Clayson said: ""Reg was quite philosophical about this and recognised the fact that he was a heavy smoker and that that contributed to his condition.""

"Gareth McAllister, 18, is also accused of inflicting wounds on a 74-year-old man during a triple stabbing in Glengormley, County Antrim.
All three alleged victims are members of the same family.
Mr McAllister, of Rogan Manor in Newtownabbey, was arrested at a nearby petrol station on Wednesday night.
A man aged 20 had suffered a slash wound to his forehead in an alleged attack at the house on the Antrim Road.
His 51-year-old father and his grandfather also sustained cuts as further violence broke out at the nearby garage, according to police.
Mr McAllister appeared before Belfast Magistrates' Court on a total of 10 counts.
He is charged with the attempted murders of Jonathan and John Green, and assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Derek Green.
The other alleged offences include: possessing a bread knife in public; four assaults on police representatives; a separate assault on John Green last Saturday; and criminal damage to his front door.
Mr McAllister spoke only to confirm he understood the charges against him.

"Hat-tricks by half-time, a caretaker managerial debut to dream of and a familiar face back on the scoresheet with his hometown club, BBC Sport picks out some of the day's headlines.
Birmingham 4-2 Bristol City
Reading striker Orlando Sa claimed the honour of the season's first Championship hat-trick as the Royals thumped Ipswich 5-1 at home on Friday.
Not to be outdone, Birmingham's City Clayton Donaldson thought he would get in on the act less than 24 hours later against Bristol City.
Inspired perhaps by Cristiano Ronaldo bagging five for Real Madrid, Donaldson put Blues 2-0 ahead after just 20 minutes.
After City clawed one back, he restored the home side's two-goal cushion from the penalty spot.
The 31-year-old had started every league game this season, but had failed to find the net before Steve Cotterill's side arrived at St Andrew's.
Not a bad afternoon's work.
Middlesbrough 2-0 MK Dons
It was a Championship signing that raised several eyebrows in the summer, England international Stewart Downing returning to his hometown club Middlesbrough from West Ham.
Just as MK Dons looked set to frustrate Aitor Karanka's men at the Riverside, Downing popped up to break the deadlock and bag his first goal of his second spell.
His trusted left foot was the source of this goal as he curled an effort into the bottom corner beyond Dons keeper David Martin.
Fellow summer addition David Nugent wrapped up the points with nine minutes remaining with his first goal for the club.
Oldham 1-5 Peterborough
Peterborough United chairman Darragh MacAnthony pressed the sacking button last weekend to bring Dave Robertson's brief stint in charge of the Posh to an end after just one win in the first six matches.
Earlier in the week, MacAnthony claimed he has a four-man shortlist for the position, but he might want to rip it up straightway and give the job to caretaker manager Grant McCann.
The former Northern Ireland international saw his side romp to a 5-1 win at Boundary Park thanks to two goals apiece from Souleymane Coulibaly and Lee Angol.
""I thought they were all superb goals,"" McCann told BBC Radio Cambridgeshire.
""I said to the players, me being greedy, if we had believed in ourselves we could have got more, but I'll settle for that.
""I didn't single anyone out in the changing room - to a man, we were exceptional.
""They took the messages that I gave to them onto the pitch - they definitely expressed themselves and played with a real freedom. I thought we were very good.""
While it may have been a good afternoon for Grant, it proved a decisive one for Oldham manager Darren Kelly.
He parted company with the club shortly after the final whistle.
Yeovil 1-1 AFC Wimbledon
It's not been much fun for Yeovil Town recently. Their physio's treatment table has easily been the busiest location at Huish Park.
Glovers manager Paul Sturrock said he would struggle to fill the substitutes' bench as he named a full team of unavailable outfield players for the visit of AFC Wimbledon.
In fact, he was only able to name five substitutes and soon there was another injury to report. Thankfully not to one of Sturrock's patched-up squad, but this time it was referee Lee Swabey calling for the magic sponge.
Sturrock's Sicknote XI were denied an heroic home win when Adebayo Akinfenwa equalised for Wimbledon with 11 minutes remaining.
Wycombe 1-2 Plymouth
Kick-off can get delayed for all sorts of reasons. Poor weather, traffic congestion around the ground, public safety, but a set of GPS trackers?
Referee Tim Robinson held up the action at Adams Park for six minutes while he sought clarity about vests being worn under the Wycombe players' shirts.
But Mr Robinson was happy to proceed when the club were able to produce a letter authorising their use.
Gareth Ainsworth's side seemed to lose track of each other fairly quickly, though, as Reuben Reid put Argyle ahead after just four minutes.
Plymouth Argyle's Twitter feed joked their former striker and now Chairboys frontman Jason Banton may have been sent down a cul-de-sac by his GPS.
Banton was able to put the joke back on the Pilgrims when he equalised with his first goal for the club.
But Jake Jervis restored the lead for the visitors, who got their revenge on the side which knocked them out of last season's play-offs.

"The central bank had originally hoped to lend up to 450bn euros to stop another credit crunch crippling the banking system.
Over 500 banks raced to borrow from the scheme, which was far beyond market expectations.
The euro rose sharply on the news, but then fell back later.
When the plan was announced, French President Nicolas Sarkozy said banks could use the money to invest in eurozone sovereign debt.
However, analysts were uncertain if banks will use the money in this way.
""The very heavy take-up of the ECB's three-year, long-term refinancing operation provides some encouragement that banks' liquidity needs are being amply met,"" said Jonathan Loynes at Capital Economics.
""But while this might help to address recent signs of renewed tensions in credit markets and support bank lending, we remain sceptical of the idea that the operation will ease the sovereign debt crisis too as banks use the funds to purchase large volumes of peripheral government bonds.""
This was the European Central Bank's first offer of three-year loans and was the largest amount of money the central bank has injected into the financial system, beating the 450bn euros it put in with its 2009 one-year loans offer.

Although the offer was seen as a success, its impact on the eurozone economy is still uncertain.
""This is good. It's a positive number, at the top end of expectations. You have to regard it as a positive result. But it is still short of covering all of the banks' financing for next year,"" said James Nixon at Societe Generale.
Borrowing money though the ECB's loans and using it to buy sovereign debt has been dubbed 'Sarkozy trade' after the French president encouraged banks to use the money to buy national debts when the loan offer was announced.
However, some suggest the money will just be used to boost bank balance sheets, especially since the ECB lowered its collateral requirements when it announced the loans, enabling weaker banks to apply for the funds.
""A cash for trash mechanism allowing banks to access cheap funds and buy up more sovereign debt - or more likely just shore up their own finances,"" is how Justin Urquhart Stewart of Seven Investment Management described the scheme.
By Robert PestonBusiness editor, BBC News
Read Robert's blog in full
Carsten Brzeski at ING, said: ""The good news is that banks won't have to worry about liquidity for three years and that it has already pushed down government yields, as banks are buying them to use as collateral"".
""However, whether the ECB's hopes that the money will filter through to the real economy will be fulfilled remains to be seen.""
The success of the offer initially had a positive impact on European stock markets, but the effect was short-lived and in afternoon trade several markets were trading lower on the day.
The ECB's move comes in the wake of turbulent times for the eurozone that have hit peripheral eurozone economies such as Greece, the Irish Republic and Portugal, and started to affect major economies such as Italy and Spain.
Banks in all these countries have lent large amounts of money to their national governments, and others in the eurozone, by buying sovereign bonds which have, historically, been seen as relatively safe investments.
Interest rates for these bonds, known as yields, have been rising during the past few months, reflecting a higher risk that a country may default. Italian yields, for example, hit a record 7% in November.
The banks that are left holding large amounts of eurozone sovereign debt are in turn seen as risky by money markets who force them to pay more to borrow money.
This situation encourages banks to lend less themselves, which trickles down to consumers and small businesses, which find it harder to get loans.
The ECB's three-year loans are designed to free up lending and avoid the kind of credit crunch that saw inter-bank lending dry up in 2008.
Although the ECB has ruled out lending directly to countries, banks taking the three-year loans at 1% are being encouraged to invest in sovereign debt at 6% to 7%.
This not only provides a lucrative return for the banks, but increases demand for sovereign debt, helping countries such as Italy and Spain that need to raise money.","Eurozone banks have rushed to take out cheap three-year loans offered by the European Central Bank, borrowing 489bn euros ($643bn; Â£375bn)."

""Jonny has gone from strength to strength,"" Richie Gray acknowledged.
""What I said a couple of years ago was about the need to do it consistently, but he's been able to do it week in week out and that's the most impressive thing.

"Nikki Collingbourne, 26, was found dead at her flat in Ivel Court, Letchworth, Hertfordshire, in May.
Yvonne Caylor, 53, is on trial at Luton Crown Court where she denies murder.
The court was played a police video of an interview with Ms Collingbourne who was questioned after Ms Caylor had complained she had been assaulted.
Six months later, Ms Caylor, of Grove Road, Hitchin, is said to have disguised herself as a man before going to Ms Collingbourne's flat and killing her.
The prosecution alleges the motive for the murder goes back to 3 October 2015 when Ms Collingbourne evicted Ms Caylor from the flat in Ivel Court.
Ms Caylor claimed Ms Collingbourne had assaulted her and, while the younger woman was in the custody of Hertfordshire Police, it is alleged Ms Caylor burgled the flat.
No action was taken against Ms Collingbourne, but Ms Caylor was charged and was due to stand trial accused of burglary and attempting to pervert the course of justice.
The case was in a ""warned list"" at Cambridge Crown Court starting on 23 May, the day of the alleged murder.
In the police interview on 4 October 2015, Ms Collingbourne said Ms Caylor had been staying with her, but was due to leave. On 3 October she said there was a confrontation in which Ms Caylor threw her iPad with force, smashing it to the floor.
Ms Collingbourne told an officer: ""I was trying to keep calm. It became worse and worse. She was pinning me against a wall saying 'I am going to...  kill you.'
""I took her stuff to the front door. She got a mop. She said, 'I am going to ram this down your throat'. It fell on the floor.""

Ibrahimovic recently signed for Manchester United after scoring 50 goals in 51 matches for French champions Paris St-Germain last season.
He also won 12 trophies in four seasons with the French club.

"The expedition to the north-eastern Antarctic peninsula will study how they reacted to previous climate changes.
The polar experts will collect 100 boxes of rock samples to date how long they have been exposed to sunlight.
A team from Aberystwyth and Swansea universities spent five months studying the Greenland ice sheet last year.
The Antarctic team will be led by Professor Neil Glasser of Aberystwyth University.
Prof Glasser and his colleagues will hunt for clues about how the glaciers and ice sheets behaved in past climates and what we can expect in the future.
The Antarctic peninsula has suffered above average warming over the past 50 years, with around a 2.5Â°C temperature increase since 1950, said the universities.
This warming is causing glaciers and ice shelves to melt, releasing large volumes of fresh water into the oceans which not only raises sea level, but also influences regional climate change.
However, scientists do not fully understand the relationship between air and sea temperature, and the melting of ice.
It is difficult for them to assess whether the melting being observed at the moment is unprecedented in the context of geological time.
To address these outstanding questions, the team will collect samples of rock to date their exposure to cosmic radiation and analyse how glaciers and ice have retreated since the last ice age, around 20,000 years ago.
""The collapse of Antarctic ice shelves is largely thought to be caused by warming of the atmosphere, but it appears that changes in sea temperature and ice-shelf structure are also important,"" said Prof Glasser.
""With the climate expected to warm in the future, it is important for us to understand how Antarctic glaciers and ice shelves behaved in the past so we can predict how they will react in years to come if temperatures continue to rise.""
The team of three scientists and one British Antarctic Survey (BAS) field assistant will be dropped off by the Royal Research Ship Ernest Shackleton on James Ross Island, just off the Antarctic Peninsula.
They will be heavily laden with equipment including four quad bikes, two trailers, scientific equipment, tents and enough food and fuel to last three months.
""Normally when researchers work in Antarctica they operate from a research ship or at an established station, whereas we will be dropped off with all our kit and left for two months with just radio contact to the rest of the world,"" said Dr Jonathan Carrivick from the University of Leeds, who will take part in the trip.
The research is funded by the Natural Environment Research Council.",Scientists from Aberystwyth and Leeds have joined forces to learn how glaciers behaved in the past so they can predict the future.
"Richard Bullick was giving evidence to the Stormont inquiry into the sale of Nama's Northern Ireland portfolio.
Mr Bullick had a series of meetings with Frank Cushnahan and Ian Coulter between September 2013 and April 2014.
Mr Coulter was a leading solicitor, while Mr Cushnahan sat on Nama's Northern Ireland advisory committee.
It later emerged that both men could have got substantial payments as part of the £1bn deal.
Mr Cushnahan advised the Pimco fund after he left his Nama role and was in line to receive a £5m fee if its bid for the portfolio was successful, an Irish parliamentary committee was told.
The bid collapsed when Nama learned of Mr Cushnahan's role in March 2014.
The portfolio was eventually sold to the Cerberus fund in April 2014.
In the wake of that deal, Cerberus indirectly paid a fee of £7.5m to Tughans, the firm where Mr Coulter was managing partner.
A large portion of that money was then moved to an Isle of Man bank account under the control of Mr Coulter.
He said that transfer was for ""a complex, commercially and legally-sensitive"" reason. The money was later moved back and Mr Coulter left the firm.
Richard Bullick said his assumption was that any benefit for the men ""would come from their clients getting freed up from Nama in the longer term"".
""If there was greater economic activity, that would provide the opportunity for both Frank and Ian and their various businesses to do well,"" he said.
Mr Bullick said he was not aware of ""the specific names"" of any clients, and only assumed that some of them were in Nama.
He added that in his experience, Mr Cushnahan and Mr Coulter had ""always acted in the best interests of Northern Ireland"".
Mr Bullick said he did not have information to know if Mr Cushnahan had a conflict of interest in his Nama role.
The inquiry also questioned Sinn Féin adviser Dara O'Hagan, who worked for Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in the run up to the deal.
Mr McGuinness previously told the inquiry it was ""totally, absolutely misleading"" for the DUP to say he was being kept informed about the bid from Pimco.
He said First Minister Peter Robinson did at some point tell him Pimco had bid and subsequently withdrawn, but not the detail.
Ms O'Hagan was asked about an email sent to her concerning the possible terms of a deal under which Pimco would buy the portfolio.
She did not pass that email to Mr McGuinness.
She explained that was because Nama matters were primarily dealt with by the Department of Finance, and she expected it to produce a formal, detailed executive paper about the matter.
Ms O'Hagan said she would have brought it to Mr McGuinness at that stage.","A DUP adviser who was ""intensively involved"" in the Nama loans sale process has said he never had ""any understanding"" that two businessmen stood to be paid as part of any deal."

The parade was truly amazing in its immensity and organisation. It lasted for two hours with countless rows of soldiers and then civilians marching past without break.
It felt at times like a meeting of a cult with citizens of North Korea jumping up and down and waving ecstatically at Kim Jong-un.
The message was clear from the podium:  China stands by North Korea - signalled by Kim Jong-un clutching the hand of a senior Chinese leader - and, secondly, that Mr Kim shows no sign of a softer stance towards the United States. As he put it:  ""The party's revolutionary armament means we are ready to fight any kind of war waged by the US imperialists"".
If his words were not clear enough, the hardware on parade underlined them - line upon line of trucks with missiles following line upon line of heavy artillery.

State television carried the events live, adding an emotional commentary.

Later, as the parade continued, tens of thousands of civilians, including school-children, danced and waved coloured pom-poms.

No world leaders attended but China, North Korea's closest ally, sent a senior Communist Party official to the anniversary.
The North Korean leader began the day by paying respects to his late father and grandfather at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in Pyongyang, official media reported.
The celebrations continued, after a downpour of rain, with an evening torchlight parade which thousands of Pyongyang citizens have been seen practising for in public squares across the city.

North Korea's nuclear programme has long been a cause for alarm in the region.
Pyongyang is believed to have conducted three underground nuclear tests and is threatening a fourth, despite international condemnation and sanctions.
Last month, it announced it was restarting its main nuclear facility Yongbyon and that it was improving its nuclear weapons ""in quality and quantity"".
The North claims it has made a nuclear device small enough to fit into the warhead of a missile.
US officials, however, have cast doubt on this claim and experts say it is difficult to assess the progress North Korea has made on miniaturisation.

The scientists who invented them tried to mimic the way that certain animals move and work together, such as ants and geckos.
On their own the Microtugs can move objects that are up to 2,000 times heavier than themselves, however the researchers decided to see if the robots could work together to pull even bigger and heavier objects.
Six of the Microtugs were able to pull a full size car - which weighed about 1800kg - meaning that together the robots were able to move more than 3,000 times their combined body weight!","When you think about super-strong robots, these little guys might not come to mind - but they are the Hulks of the robot world!"
"Baraclough, 46, takes over from Jim Magilton, who remains the Irish Football Association's elite performance director.
The new under-21 manager moves into the post after leaving his role as assistant to Oldham boss John Sheridan.
""I am looking forward to working with young players in Northern Ireland,"" said Baraclough.
""I will be aiming to help the team be successful in qualifying and also to help develop future senior internationals.""
Baraclough had a 20-year playing career which saw him play for QPR, Notts County and Scunthorpe United.
He became Scunthorpe manager in 2010 before moving to Sligo Rovers two years later, where he guided the Irish club to the League of Ireland title plus FAI Cup and Setanta Cup triumphs.
After being appointed Motherwell manager, he kept the club in the Scottish Premier League and was then handed the Oldham assistant's role after departing from the SPL outfit.
Northern Ireland senior manager Michael O'Neill said Baraclough would be a ""great addition to our international coaching team"".

He also ignored road signs warning of elderly pedestrians crossing, a sign reading ""Slow"" and chevron markings indicating a crossing ahead.
Prosecuting, Gareth Walters told Birmingham Crown Court Junior's speed was an estimated 47mph (75kmh) in a 30mph (48.3kmh) zone when he struck the family on Grove Lane.

"SNP MP George Kerevan is to call for an inquiry into the policy in the light of last year's attempted coup in Turkey and tensions with its Nato partners.
Major repairs to RAF combat jets have previously been carried out in the UK.
The Ministry of Defence said the F-35 was an international project with a global support network.
Turkey was selected by the US department of defence's joint programme office, based near the Pentagon, to provide ""deep maintenance"" and repair of engines for all F-35 aircraft based in Europe.
There will also be engine repair facilities in Australia and North America.
But Mr Kerevan said the UK should consider setting up back-up facilities.
""The UK should have options in the event of a diplomatic crisis with Turkey,"" he told BBC News.
""I want to know what alternative arrangements are in place if it became impossible to have the the engines overhauled.""
The MP is writing to the defence select committee to ask it to investigate.
Mark Bobbi, principal analyst at IHS Jane's, said the MP was right to raise the issue.
""My concern is that any cessation of Turkish engine maintenance would strain customer operations of the F-35,"" he told BBC News.
""If such is in the context of combat operations in the Middle East, then the issue becomes very serious indeed.""
He said there was ""far less concern"" about the theft of intellectual property or ""reverse engineering"" if an F-35 ""fell into the wrong hands"" because aircraft engines are extremely difficult to replicate.
But he added: ""F-35 partners, all of them, should be concerned with Turkey and be ready to respond quickly to any political, social, or 'military' crisis.""
The F-35, formerly known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is being built by US defence giant Lockheed Martin in partnership with other countries including the UK, which makes about 15% of the components.
The UK has so far ordered 24 of the jets, the first of which are due to go into service with the RAF and the Royal Navy next year.
The short take-off and vertical landing planes, which will be known as the Lightning II, are set to be deployed on the UK's two new Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers.
The nine F-35 partner nations - US, UK, Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Norway, the Netherlands and Turkey - will share maintenance tasks, with UK companies handling repairs to electronics and ejector seats at a facility in North Wales.
The Ministry of Defence said this system would ensure ""the UK's security of supply of F-35 engines is not impacted"".
""F-35 is an international programme, with maintenance and repair hubs in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific and a global support network that ensures security of supply for all involved,"" said an MoD spokesman.
""The UK, along with the other F-35 partner nations, benefit from this approach and the efficiencies it delivers.""
Defence Secretary Michael Fallon last week announced funding for a Â£40m training, engineering and maintenance hub for F-35s at RAF Marham, in Norfolk, at a joint press conference with US counterpart General James Mattis.

"Blackman, 39, from Taunton, Somerset, has been told he will spend at least 10 years in prison.
It comes after one of the UK's highest-ranking Royal Marines pledged his ""full support"" for Blackman, saying he had been ""tainted"" by the ""impact of war"".
The Ministry of Defence said it respected the court's decision.
By Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, BBC News
In the words of his commanding officer, Sgt Al Blackman, the man until recently known just as Marine A, had a proud career and promising future.
That was until a momentary and fatal lapse of judgement that not only prematurely ended the life of the injured Afghan fighter he shot, but also altered his own forever.
His commanding officer said that  Blackman was not a bad man, but a ""normal citizen"" tainted by the impact of war.
But while the Judge Advocate General said there were mitigating circumstances to this unusual case,  Blackman had treated the injured Afghan with contempt and murdered him in cold blood.
He said his reaction to the murder caught on tape was chilling.
The sentence passed was always going to be  controversial - this was a murder carried out by a man  who was serving his country in a war with a ruthless enemy.
But those who criticise must also reflect that the sentence was approved by a group of Blackman's peers - those in uniform who've also experienced combat.
In the words of Judge Blackett,  it's their reputation too that's been tarnished. While there will be sympathy, there's also anger.
On Thursday, three judges at the High Court lifted an anonymity order allowing Blackman to be named.
Lt Col Simon Chapman, in a letter read to the judge and board at the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, described how Blackman's promising career had been shattered in a ""momentary"" lapse of judgement.
The Ministry of Defence, in a statement, said: ""Throughout this case the Ministry of Defence has followed the independent legal process and a sentence has now been delivered.
""We respect the authority and decision of the court and it would be inappropriate of us to comment on the sentence.""
The trial - during which Blackman was referred to as Marine A - was the first time a member of the British armed forces had faced a murder charge in relation to the conflict in Afghanistan, which began in 2001.
Two other marines were cleared.
The murder took place after a patrol base in Helmand came under attack from small-arms fire from two insurgents.
One of them was seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field.
Officer's letter defends marine
The incident was inadvertently filmed by one of the cleared marines - known as Marine B - on his helmet-mounted camera. That footage, taken on 15 September 2011, was shown to the court during the two-week trial.
It showed Blackman shooting the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol.
Sentencing Blackman, Judge Advocate General Jeff Blackett told him he had disgraced the name of the British armed services and had put troops' lives at risk by his actions.
""This was not an action taken in the heat of battle or immediately after you had been engaged in a firefight,"" he said.
""Nor were you under any immediate threat - the video footage shows that you were in complete control of yourself, standing around for several minutes and not apparently worried that you might be at risk of attack by other insurgents.""
Blackman was told that when he is released from prison by the Parole Board he could be recalled if he breached the terms of that licence.
In fixing the minimum term of imprisonment, the judge said the court took into account the effect of the arduous six-month tour upon Blackman.
""This was your sixth operational tour and your second to Afghanistan in under 14 years of service,"" the judge said.
""We accept that you were affected by the constant pressure, ever present danger and fear of death or serious injury.
""This was enhanced by the reduction of available men in your command post so that you had to undertake more patrols yourself and place yourself and your men in danger more often.
""We also accept the psychiatric evidence presented today that when you killed the insurgent it was likely that you were suffering to some degree from combat stress disorder.
""While we acknowledge your personal circumstances and the immense pressure you were under, we note that thousands of other service personnel have experienced the same or similar stresses.
""They exercised self-discipline and acted properly and humanely; you did not.""",Royal Marine Sergeant Alexander Blackman has been sentenced to life by a court martial for murdering an insurgent in Afghanistan.
"The proposal from Buckinghamshire councils includes a 15-mile (24km) tunnel from the M25 to Wendover.
Current government plans include some tunnels but leaves about eight miles in exposed or partially-covered cuttings.
HS2 said it had ""considered"" further tunnelling but stood by its plans.
Plans for the HS2 between London and Birmingham and then to Manchester and Leeds have been developed by the government under holding company HS2 Ltd.
It promises to reduce journey times between Birmingham and London from 81 to 49 minutes, and slash the trip to Manchester by an hour, to 68 minutes.
The new Chilterns Long Tunnel Route report, produced by Peter Brett Associates, was commissioned by Chiltern District Council, Aylesbury Vale District Council, Buckinghamshire County Council and the Chilterns Conservation Board to look at alternative proposals.
The group said the planned route through the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) would result in an ""adverse and irreversible impact"" on the landscape.
HS2 Ltd's proposal includes about 13km (8 miles) in a tunnel from the M25 to Little Missenden and 12km (7.5 miles) on two viaducts, in two green tunnels and either on embankments or in cuttings.
The new plan includes a 24.2km (15 mile) tunnel from the M25 to Wendover, the first 9km (5.5 miles) of which would follow the exact alignment of the government scheme.
The report concluded a long tunnel was ""technically feasible"", would protect the landscape and ""be a better route operationally"".
It is the second time the group has proposed a tunnel scheme but it said the latest proposal would have less impact on the countryside.
The cost is estimated at Â£1.85bn, as opposed to the government's Â£1.45bn plan, but campaigners said this was ""a small price to pay"" to ""preserve a beautiful and unique part of the countryside"".
HS2 spokesman Ben Ruse said the firm was ""committed to protecting the environment"" and a tunnel through the entire AONB had been ""explored and given extensive consideration"".
He added: ""However, we have clearly set out how the current proposals provide the best balance between route engineering design requirements, cost and the desire to minimise environmental impacts.""",Plans for an HS2 tunnel under the Chilterns to protect the area have been announced by campaigners opposing existing proposals for the high-speed rail link.
"Rotherwas Chapel, in Herefordshire, has been unused for many years and currently can only be viewed by making an appointment through English Heritage.
But a newly formed Friends of the Chapel group are striving to make the historic chapel, once part of a large estate, more accessible to visitors.
The mass, open to all, is due to take place on Monday.
Margot Miller, a member of the Friends of the Chapel, which formed earlier this year, said research had not thrown up any records of mass ever being held there.
""It was originally used as a family church for the Bodenham family, not a parish church, so we don't know if any mass was heard,"" she said.
The Ministry of Defence took over the building after the death of the last Bodenham family member and it was used by soldiers defending the munitions factory in Rotherwas.
The rest of the estate was knocked down.
English Heritage eventually took the chapel over and Ms Miller and other volunteers formed a group to help look after and clean the building.
""It is a lovely chapel,"" she said.
""A beautiful little building. We think it was mainly used in the 16th century and it has a little altar and stained glass windows. The Bodenham family spent a lot of money on it.""

"The date was 23 February 1957, an era now dim in the memory.
Harold MacMillan had just become prime minister following the Suez crisis. The Reverend Martin Luther King of Montgomery, Alabama, graced the cover of that week's Time magazine for the first time.
In Coatbridge that weekend, the weather was bad, with a blizzard blowing in, but as she stepped out into the street, Moira was wrapped-up well, in her navy school coat and a knitted hat.
She was a slight, pretty girl with fair hair and blue eyes, something of a tomboy, who enjoyed swimming and playing marbles.
The Co-op in Laird Street was a short distance from Moira's gran's house in Muiryhall Street, but there is no evidence that Moira ever arrived at the shop.
As the hours and then the days passed the people of Coatbridge, horrified by the mystery of the missing girl, searched and searched but not a trace was ever found.
Moira's family never saw her again and, for many years it seemed likely that no-one would ever know what had happened to her.
Townsfolk criticised the efforts of the police and, in the absence of hard evidence, suspicion fell, unfairly, on Moira's family.
In fact officers did have one important lead - witnesses had seen Moira boarding a local Baxter's bus. But detectives appear to have failed to follow it up properly.
Had they done so, they would have discovered that the bus driver was Alexander Gartshore, who was on bail at the time facing charges of raping his children's babysitter.
Gartshore, a freemason in a lodge where many local policemen were also said to be members, had long been suspected of being a ""flasher"" in local parks.
On 23 January 1957 he had been charged with ""having carnal knowledge of a minor and other offences of a sexual nature.""
In February Moira went missing.
In April, Gartshore was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.
But it was not until his estranged daughter, Sandra Brown, discovered this terrible family secret that the search for the truth really began. Even then it took many more years to find it.
Recalling events in her book ""Where There is Evil"", Mrs Brown describes how, in 1992, she confronted Gartshore about his failings as a father.
To her astonishment, she writes, he told her that his own father ""wouldn't forgive me for Moira Anderson"".
""Grandpa was always convinced I'd done it,"" he told his daughter. ""He said to me tae tell the polis where I'd put the wee lassie.
""...I was the driver of the bus the day she went missing. I told Grandpa I didn't even know her, but she got on my bus, in all the snow. I was the last tae speak tae her. I was the last person tae see her...""
Horrified by the conversation, and suspecting that she now knew the killer, Mrs Brown began a long campaign to bring her own father to justice.
When he was interviewed by police in 1992, Gartshore claimed that Moira had boarded his bus to buy a surprise birthday card for her mother at Woolworth's.
The revelation was intriguing. It was indeed Maisie Anderson's 40th birthday the day after her daughter disappeared but how would Gartshore have known that if he had not spoken to Moira?
Detectives felt it gave credibility to the case against their suspect, placing Moira on the bus and hinting that she knew the driver well, despite his denials.
Nonetheless, they concluded that there was not enough evidence to charge Gartshore, and he died in 2006.
Last year, the case was given new impetus as police and prosecutors from Scotland's cold case unit exhumed a grave in Old Monkland Cemetery where a friend of Gartshore had been buried around the time that Moira disappeared.
The theory was that Gartshore had used the funeral to shift Moira from a ditch and hide her where no-one would think of looking - in a graveyard.
Moira's remains were not in the plot but the case gained widespread media coverage and two new witnesses came forward.
According to the Crown Office, Scotland's prosecuting authority, both witnesses had credible reasons for not having done so before.
The first witness recalled how, as a little girl in Coatbridge, Gartshore had exposed himself to her and Moira Anderson in a local park in the summer of 1956 and had called Moira by name.
Even more importantly, the second witness stated that late in the afternoon on 23 February 1957, near the Carnbroe bus terminus, he had seen a man ""dragging a young girl by the arms"".
The witness said the girl looked like Moira Anderson. He also identified the man as Gartshore.
With other circumstantial evidence, these witness accounts would have been enough, say the Crown, for a murder trial.
Apart from the obvious - why? - and the practical - how and where? - many questions remain.
Was anyone else involved in the killing?
Was it incompetence or even corruption which stymied the original police investigation?
And, of course, where is Moira's body?
But at least one question which has haunted Coatbridge for more than half a century, does appear to have been answered: it seems that Alexander Gartshore murdered Moira Anderson.","It was a bitter, snowy Saturday evening when Moira Anderson left her grandmother's house in Coatbridge to buy some butter."
"The Strasbourg judges said Russia had discriminated against three gay rights activists who opposed the law. It was adopted in 2013, banning promotion of homosexuality among people under 18.
The law ""reinforced stigma and prejudice and encouraged homophobia"", the ruling said.
Gay rights groups condemned the law.
Under the law, private individuals deemed to be promoting ""homosexual behaviour among minors"" face fines of up to 5,000 roubles (£67; $85), while officials risk paying 10 times that amount. Businesses and schools can be fined up to 500,000 roubles.
Homosexuality was decriminalised in Russia in 1993, but anti-gay prejudice is rife.
Critics see the propaganda law as part of a state campaign to marginalise LGBT activists, whose work includes dissemination of sexual health advice.
The Strasbourg court said the fines imposed on three Russian gay rights activists violated Article 10 (freedom of expression) and Article 14 (prohibition of discrimination) of the European Convention on Human Rights.
According to the court, the legislation aimed at curbing promotion of homosexuality was ""not clearly defined"" and was implemented in an arbitrary way. It ""served no legitimate public interest"", the court said.
Russia's justice ministry says it will appeal, arguing that the law is aimed ""exclusively at protecting the morals and health of children"".
MP Vitaly Milonov, of the ruling United Russia party, who introduced the original bill into the St Petersburg parliament and which formed the basis of the federal law, told BBC Russian that the court's decision was ""anti-national"".
""It is absolutely harmful, and those who set up this decision are enemies of Europe,"" he said.
The three activists had been found guilty for protesting against the law in 2009-2012 - outside a secondary school in Ryazan, a children's library in Archangel and an administrative building in St Petersburg.
The court rejected the Russian government's claim that such a law was needed to protect morality.
It found that the government had ""failed to demonstrate how freedom of expression on LGBT issues would devalue or otherwise adversely affect actual and existing 'traditional families' or would compromise their future"".
Such laws, the judges said, ""embodied a predisposed bias on the part of a heterosexual majority against a homosexual minority"".
They ordered Russia to pay each of the activists damages of between €8,000 (£7,000; $8,900) and €20,000.
One of the three, Nikolai Alexeyev, hailed the ruling as a ""total victory"", the BBC's Sarah Rainsford reports from Moscow.
He had picketed a children's library, holding a sign declaring that gay people could also be great - and listing the Russian composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky and filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein as examples.","Russia's ""gay propaganda"" law is discriminatory and encourages homophobia, the European Court of Human Rights has ruled."
"The rescue means that nine people have been recovered alive from the Rigopiano hotel in the eastern Abruzzo region.
At least 15 people are still missing after the avalanche that came after several earthquakes and heavy snowfall.
While one more survivor has yet to be rescued, Italian media said other voices may have been heard in the ruins during the night.
Five people have been confirmed dead.
The first five survivors were taken to safety on Friday, some 40 hours after the avalanche hit on Wednesday.
They had reportedly taken refuge beneath a collapsed portion of ceiling, where they were able to light a fire to keep warm for two days.
The rescue has been hampered by deep snow blocking an access road.
There are also concerns that further avalanches could follow, Italian newspaper La Stampa reported.
The first person pulled out on Friday was an eight-year-old boy, the son of a holidaymaker, Giampiero Parete, who had gone to his car when the avalanche struck and first sounded the alarm by calling his boss.
The boy's mother, Adriana, was pulled out next, telling rescue workers her six-year-old daughter was still trapped inside.
The little girl was also later saved and the family was reunited at a hospital in the coastal town of Pescara.
Hospital officials told the Associated Press news agency they had symptoms of hypothermia and dehydration, but were otherwise in good health.
Reports said all four children who survived did so because they were all playing in the same games room, that avoided the worst of the damage.
The latest rescues, of two men and two women, took place at about 03:00 local time (02:00 GMT) on Saturday.
Wednesday's earthquakes included four stronger than magnitude 5, in a region already struggling with heavy snowfall that buried phone lines and took out power cables.
Many of the guests had gathered on the ground floor of the hotel to await evacuation following the earthquakes.
But the avalanche completely buried the hotel at about 17:00 (16:00 GMT) on Wednesday.
The force of the snow partially brought down the roof and, according to some reports, shifted the building 10m (32 feet) off its foundations.

"Sean Caffrey hacked into the US Department of Defense system in 2014, the National Crime Agency (NCA) said.
He accessed and stole the ranks, usernames and email addresses of more than 800 users, as well as of about 30,000 satellite phones.
At Birmingham Crown Court Caffrey, 25, of Sutton Coldfield, admitted an offence under the Computer Misuse Act.

The NCA said the theft took place on 15 June 2014 and Caffrey was arrested in in March 2015 after intelligence showed the hack originated from his internet connection.
Forensic examination of his computers found the stolen data on the hard drives.
Officers also found that an online messaging account linked to the attack had been opened and operated under a pseudonym using Caffrey's computers.
The Department of Defense said it cost about $628,000 to fix the damage.

"Jim Murphy was responding to former Tory chairman Lord Baker's view that there could be a deal between the two rival parties after May's election.
However, the Labour MP has not ruled out some kind of deal with the SNP.
Mr Murphy told BBC political editor Brian Taylor that it was ""disrespectful"" to discuss political deals before the general election.
On the suggestion of his party entering into a Conservative arrangement in the event of a hung parliament, Mr Murphy was very clear.
He said: ""We don't need lessons from Tory dinosaurs about how to run Scotland, what a ludicrous idea.""
Mr Murphy added that the differences between the Labour Party and the Conservative Party were bigger than ""I have seen for a number of years"".
Writing in The Independent, Lord Baker of Dorking said a Labour minority government reliant on the SNP would be a ""nightmare"" situation at Westminster.
He added that such an arrangement could ""stretch the constitution of our country to breaking point"".
However, the SNP said it was trusted more than Labour to keep the Tories out.
Asked if a deal with the nationalists was possible, Mr Murphy said he did not want to get into a ""post-match analysis on an event that has not yet taken place"".
He told Brian Taylor during a half-hour webcast: ""As I say, if the SNP want to vote for our policies in the House of Commons, it's up to them - some time they have done that in recent times, quite often they have sided with the Tories against Labour.""
Mr Murphy said he had no desire to focus on the ""politics of pessimism"" because he wanted his party to win government.
The debate over coalition deals has arisen because polling suggests neither Labour nor the Conservatives would gain an overall majority in this year's election.
If that is the case a coalition deal with smaller parties could be possible or a so-called ""confidence and supply"" arrangement could be agreed whereby the smaller party supports the larger party in key votes.

"The move ends an embarrassing situation for the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who last year pledged to try to put Wonga out of business by helping credit unions compete with it.
It later emerged that the Church had indirectly staked about Â£75,000 in Wonga through an investment fund.
The archbishop told the BBC he was ""absolutely delighted"" that the investment had ended.
When details of the link emerged last year, Archbishop Welby had admitted to being ""embarrassed"" and ""irritated"".
The Church Commissioners for England, which deals with the Church's investments, said on Thursday it was ""pleased to announce"" the indirect exposure to Wonga as part of its venture capital portfolio had been removed.
""At no time have the commissioners invested directly in Wonga or in other payday lenders,"" the commissioners' statement said, adding that the indirect exposure was ""considerably less than 0.01% of the value of Wonga"".
It said the commissioners believed venture capital to be ""a good and useful instrument with significant potential to serve the common good"", but that a number of ""ethical investment changes"" had been made.
These included tightening investment restrictions for direct investments, with new controls on indirect investments due to be announced later in the year.
The statement added: ""We no longer have any financial or any other interest in Wonga.""
In an interview to be broadcast on this Sunday's Andrew Marr show, Archbishop Welby said: ""I have been absolutely clear that I do not believe that the rates of interest charged by these companies are ethical and moral - they are legal but they are not ethical or moral.""
As he does not sit on the Church's assets committee, he had no ""legal right to intervene"", he said, adding: ""I can obviously apply pressure, encouragement, and I've tried to do that and I'm absolutely delighted that we are now out of Wonga and have taken no profit from it.""
Details of the investment emerged in July 2013 shortly after Archbishop Welby said he had ""bluntly"" told Wonga boss Errol Damelin ""we're not in the business of trying to legislate you out of existence; we're trying to compete you out of existence"".

"In a letter to The Times, 20 former defence chiefs said to ""abandon"" Britain's four Trident submarines would be ""an enormous gamble"" which could threaten ""the survival of our nation"".
Signatories include two retired defence secretaries and two ex-GCHQ directors.
A decision on whether to renew Trident is due to be taken in 2016.
On Tuesday, Labour's shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said his party was committed to renewing all four Trident submarines if it wins the election.
The Conservatives have also committed to renewing all four missile submarines, while the Liberal Democrats favour cutting to three.
The SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens want Trident to be scrapped. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon argued on Wednesday that Britain should strengthen its conventional armed forces instead of ""obsessing"" about nuclear weapons.
UKIP has said it would not scrap Trident, but would consider cutting back to three submarines.
Among those to have signed the letter are former Labour defence secretaries Lord Hutton and Lord Robertson, the latter an ex-Nato chief, and retired chief of the general staff Gen Sir Mike Jackson.
Three previous heads of the armed forces, three ex-Royal Navy chiefs, and two former directors of government communications agency GCHQ are also among the signatories.
Analysis
By BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale
The list of those who've signed this letter is a who's who of those responsible for Britain's security over the past decade and they have a warning as apocalyptic as the weapon they now defend.
With the four submarines that carry the Trident missiles coming to the end of their life, they say any further delay in the decision to replace them will in effect end Britain's nuclear deterrent and ruin its credibility abroad.
Abandoning the deterrent would, they say, be an enormous gamble and an irresponsible folly.
Though both Labour and the Conservatives say they're committed to keeping it, there are fears that political deals, and the significant costs of replacing Trident - at least Â£25bn  - could lead to further delays after the election.
The Coalition Government had already postponed the main decision to build the next generation of trident submarines until 2016.
The open letter addressed to ""the incoming Prime Minister 2015"" said a decision not to renew the fleet would ""effectively end Britain's nuclear deterrent"", and would be ""irrevocable"".
""To abandon Trident now and for good in the hope that no threat will emerge would be to take an enormous gamble on behalf of generations not yet born,"" they said.
""In an uncertain world where some powers are now displaying a worrying faith in nuclear weapons as an instrument of policy and influence, it would be irresponsible folly to abandon Britain's own independent deterrent.""
The decision would affect ""the security and ultimately the survival of our nation"", they said.
The UK had made reductions in its nuclear arsenal proportionately greater than any other nuclear weapons power, which represented ""a huge contribution towards nuclear disarmament"", the letter said.
""We should stand ready to do more, but only if it can be proved that it does not compromise minimum levels of nuclear deterrence,"" it added.
This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad.

Raccoons are listed as one of the top 50 invasive, non-native species in Scotland. Kept as pets and in zoos, there have been several escapes in the last few years.
They are considered a nuisance in their native north America,  as they damage buildings and gardens and forage in rubbish bins. They also carry wildlife diseases such as rabies.

Mr Maude held ministerial positions in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and John Major as well as David Cameron.
He won his seat in the 2010 general election, defeating the Liberal Democrats, with a majority of 11,460.
In a letter to the Horsham Conservative Association, he said: ""I was first elected to the House of Commons in 1983 just before I was 30, and will be nearly 67 by the time of the election in 2020.

"The European Banking Authority (EBA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), based in Canary Wharf in London, employ just over 1,000 staff between them.
The banking and medicines agencies are seen as the first spoils of Brexit by the 27 remaining members of the EU.
About 20 countries are expected to enter the bidding process.
There will be fierce competition to attract the agencies' highly skilled employees, their families and the business that comes with them.
This includes about 40,000 hotel stays for visitors each year.
Countries have printed glossy brochures, posted promotional videos online and hired lobbying firms.
Frankfurt - location of the European Central Bank and a major financial centre - is seen as favourite to get the EBA. But Paris is also keen to win that contest.
And the Irish government is marketing Dublin as a location, with a brochure that highlights the city's business culture as well as ""beaches and mountains on its doorstep"".
The contest has pitched larger countries against smaller ones from across the EU.
Each country can bid to host one or both agencies. But it can only make one bid per agency.
The European Commission will assess the entries based on the quality of office space, job opportunities for spouses, good ""European-oriented"" schooling and transport links.
Accessibility and efficient infrastructure are the top two agreed criteria.
Amid the rivalry to host the EMA, the Netherlands, Ireland and Denmark have hosted events in Brussels to promote their bids, the Politico news website reports. The number of states vying for the EMA is reckoned to be 21.

"Allegations against the Rt Rev George Bell were first made by the victim in 1995 but were not investigated or referred to the police.
Bell was Bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death in October 1958.
Current Bishop Dr Martin Warner issued a formal apology after the Diocese of Chichester settled the civil claim.
He paid tribute to the victim's courage in coming forward to report the abuse.
""I am committed to ensuring that the past is handled with honesty and transparency,"" he said.
The allegations of sexual offences against Bell date from the late 1940s and early 1950s and concern an individual who was at the time a young child.
The victim first reported the abuse to the then Bishop of Chichester, Eric Kemp, in August 1995 but no action was taken until contact was made with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby's office in 2013.
Following settlement of the claim, Bishop Warner wrote to the survivor formally apologising and expressing his deep sorrow.
The victim's solicitor said they remained bitter their 1995 complaint was not properly listened to or dealt with.

""There's potential to keep building and take the club to where it belongs.
""That's the long term goal [to try and win the league]. It's not going to happen overnight. We need to try and build the young players coming through. We have to balance it off with selling players and producing our own and bringing good talent in.""
Hearts missed two attempts from the penalty spot as they were made to battle for all three points at home to Kilmarnock, with Jamie Walker managing to score on the rebound from his effort.
""It's good to get three points against a tough team,"" said Neilson. ""We had a couple of chances to kill the game off, it's something we need to improve.
""It gives us a lift after the disappointment last weekend at Dundee United.
""There will still be a lot of twists and turns before the end of the season, everyone can beat everyone in this league. You see today we're playing second bottom and really had to grind out a 1-0 result. Dundee United go to Ross County and win 3-0 so it just shows you there's a good standard here.""
Kilmarnock manager Lee Clark thought his side played well enough to earn at least a point but said his players have much to improve on if they are to avoid the relegation play-off.
The Rugby Park men are two points adrift in 11th, while Dundee United closed the gap at the bottom to eight points, with Mixu Paatelainen's men having a game in hand.
""We're disappointed with how we've given the penalty away,"" said Clark. ""It is a penalty. I'm disappointed we haven't done more to help out our goalkeeper after a terrific save.
""In our predicament we need to get results. Good performances and not getting points on the board aren't sufficient for us.
""I've said to the players I think we've wasted the first half because we were waiting for things to happen rather than making them happen. We did that better in the second half.
""Our defensive displays have been good. We've given a disappointing penalty away, two disappointing penalties really. We've had lots of possession, lots of situations, but we need to work the goalkeeper a lot more.""",Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson says he extended his Tynecastle contract because he wants to lead the club to the Premiership title.
"The footage, apparently filmed in December, shows 15 girls in black robes identifying themselves.
The girls were taken from a school in the town of Chibok by members of the Islamist group Boko Haram.
Relatives of the girls marched in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday, the second anniversary of their abduction.
The kidnapping of the 276 girls triggered the global social media campaign #BringBackOurGirls, involving US first lady Michelle Obama and a host of celebrities.
But despite their efforts, most of the girls are still missing.
The footage of the girls is the first to be seen since May 2014, when around 100 of them were shown in a video.
It was broadcast after being handed to the Nigerian government.
The BBC's Martin Patience in Abuja says hundreds of parents marching on Thursday blame the previous government for doing nothing when the abduction took place, as well as the current administration for failing to devote enough resources to the search.
Boko Haram militants attacked the government boarding school in Borno state on 14 April 2014, seizing the girls who had gone there to take exams.
Shortly afterwards they released a video of them and demanded a prisoner exchange.
The video is too short for any meaningful comment on the state of health of the girls, but the 15 that appeared looked well fed and do not seem to show any sign of distress. However, their captors may have selected them from among the 219 girls still in captivity specifically to give that impression.
It has always been clear that Boko Haram regard the Chibok girls as high-value and a potential negotiating tool. In the past they have indicated their desire to exchange some of the girls with some of their commanders arrested by the government.
Recently, the military authorities in Nigeria have been claiming victory over the insurgents, pointing to the destruction of various militant camps spread across the group's stronghold in north-eastern Nigeria and the killing of many members of the group.
However the video indicates that despite these successes, the group has been able to hold secure locations where they can hide the girls, even if only in small groups.
These safe havens may provide many of the group's leadership an environment in which they can lie low and regroup at a later time, as they did after the premature victory declared by the Nigerian government against Boko Haram in 2009.
The video has however raised other questions as to how talks are proceeding over the girls' release -  what is the motive for releasing the video to a media house in the middle of negotiations that have the trust of all involved?
Boko Haram's leader, Abubakar Shekau, said the girls had converted to Islam and he threatened to force them into marriage with his fighters or sell them into slavery.
As the months passed, about 57 students managed to escape but at least 219 are still missing.
The latest video, apparently filmed on Christmas Day 2015, shows the girls pleading with the Nigerian government to co-operate with militants on their release.
They said they were being treated well but wanted to be with their families.
Two other mothers, Rifkatu Ayuba and Mary Ishaya, also said they had recognised their daughters in the video while a third mother, Yana Galang, identified five of the missing girls, Reuters news agency reports.
They were shown the video at a screening organised by local officials in Maiduguri, capital of Borno state.
""They were definitely our daughters... all we want is for the government to bring back our girls,"" said Mrs Galang.
Amnesty International says about 2,000 children have been abducted by Boko Haram since 2014. Many are used as sex slaves, fighters and even suicide bombers.
Although the militants are still launching attacks, the Nigerian army has made progress in its fight against them over the past year, our correspondent adds.
It has retaken towns and villages controlled by Boko Haram and has also freed hundreds of women and children held captive.

"AC London were formed in 2012 by Prince Choudary to help stop teenagers in Croydon falling into a life of gangs.
They entertain Crawley Down Gatwick in the extra preliminary round on Saturday (15:00 BST), with Choudary set to become the youngest manager in the competition's history.
""In 2011 we didn't exist, now we're in the FA Cup,"" said the 21-year-old.
As well as founding and managing AC London, trainee solicitor Choudary is also chairman of the 10th-tier Combined Counties League Division One club.
Choudary was at school when rioting took place across London in the summer of 2011.
Croydon, where Choudary was born and raised, was one of the areas badly hit.
""They broke into my uncle's clothes shop, causing him to sell up his livelihood. They went past our house but luckily nothing happened,"" Choudary told BBC Sport.
""The problem is the youth are misled in today's society and go down the wrong path; they choose the street life.
""It was soon after the riots that I had the idea to start a new football club. There was little in terms of activities in Croydon and I wanted to make a change.""
AC London has grown rapidly since being founded as a youth team in July 2012.
Within three years they were elected into the football pyramid for the first time and spent 2015-16 in the Kent Invicta League before being transferred to the Combined Counties.
""Setting up a club from scratch is an extremely hard task to achieve,"" added Choudary, who has FA Level 1, FA Level 2 and Uefa B coaching badges.
""I worked part time at a local solicitor's office as a cleaner to get the extra cash.""
The current squad is made up of 16 nationalities, including players from Venezuela, Brazil, Cameroon, Spain, Bulgaria, Finland, Greece and Nigeria.
AC London groundshare at Whyteleafe's 2,000-capacity Church Road ground, close to Croydon.
James Phillips is believed to be the youngest boss in FA Cup history after he led Romsey Town in the competition at the age of 22 in 2014.
Choudary was not born when Everton beat Manchester United in the 1995 FA Cup final at Wembley.
""Being the youngest manager and chairman has taken years of sacrifice and hard work that I invested to make this a reality,"" added Choudary, who played as a goalkeeper for the club but now concentrates on his off-field roles.
""The one advantage about being chairman and manager is that I can't sack myself.""
AC London's squad includes club captain and defender Ernest Simon, who is more than 10 years older than Choudary.
Choudary said he hoped for a crowd of about 400, which would be a club record, for the visit of Crawley Down Gatwick, who play one tier higher in the Southern Combination League.
It is just 68 days since Arsenal beat Chelsea to win the 2016-17 FA Cup at Wembley.
The extra preliminary round features 370 teams who will have to win six games if they are to advance to the first round in November. Winning clubs at this stage will receive £1,500.

When he went upstairs to check on Kian he had drowned.
Prosecutors said Passey and her friend had been drinking coffee and smoking outside.

"A third of London's boroughs suffer from high rates of TB, with more than 40 incidents per 100,000 people.
Some wards in Brent, Ealing, Harrow, Hounslow and Newham have rates of more than 150 per 100,000.
The report said prisoners, homeless people, people with substance abuse issues, refugees and migrants were particularly at risk.
Although the BCG vaccination against TB is recommended for all newborn babies in London, eight of the 24 boroughs do not offer it.
The rate of infection among UK-born Londoners has risen, while among the non-UK-born it has fallen - and the report said it would be wrong to assume TB was a disease of migrants.
The borough with the highest rate per 100,000 people was Newham, with 107 cases. Figures for 2013 from the World Health Organisation showed in Rwanda the figure was 69, while in Iraq it was 45.
Algeria and Guatemala also had a lower incidence than the capital, the reports points out.
The average rate per 100,000 in the UK as a whole was 13.
A few strains of the disease are now resistant to antibiotic treatment and the cost of treating them can be as high as £500,000 per patient.

Source: Tackling TB in London
The London Assembly is calling on Mayor Boris Johnson to educate Londoners about TB, saying many people in the capital are unaware of how TB spreads.
More than half of those surveyed thought spitting could transmit it. In fact, TB is usually spread by close and prolonged contact with someone who is coughing and sneezing.
""Prevention is poor and awareness low, even among the medical profession itself,"" said Dr Onkar Sahota, the chairman of the Assembly's health committee.
He described the treatment for drug-resistant strains as ""expensive, complicated and terribly gruelling"".
""The quality of care for TB sufferers also varies across the capital,"" he said.
The Assembly said it was ""unacceptable that children are put at risk of developing a potentially life-threatening illness on the basis of which borough they are born in"" and that offering BCG would not cost boroughs more.
Prisoners were among the groups highlighted as being particularly at risk, but TB screening in prisons is not effective enough and the capital's approach to tackling the disease is ""fragmented"", the report says.
The report calls on the Mayor and the Greater London Authority to fund a new ""find and treat"" service and use the Team London volunteer network as TB community health champions.
The Mayor's office said he remains ""committed to tackling TB"" although recent figures show in the three years to 2014, the number of people infected in the capital fell.
He is ""assured by Public Health England that every effort continues to be made to prevent and treat the disease in London"", a statement said.","Parts of London have higher rates of tuberculosis than Rwanda or Iraq, a report from the London Assembly says."
"Set 302 to win from 46 overs at Taunton, Middlesex needed eight from the last and Simpson lofted Jim Allenby over long leg to finish 79 not out.
Nick Gubbins contributed 76 and James Fuller smashed 36 from only 18 balls.
Somerset, 348-6 overnight, earlier declared on 446-9 to give Middlesex an invitation they were happy to accept.
The visitors, who began the game with a one-point lead at the top of County Championship Division One, extended it to 14 points because of Warwickshire's draw with Hampshire and Lancashire's week off.
The catalyst for victory came from Fuller, who took three wickets in the morning session then provided acceleration to the run chase.
With 109 needed from nine overs, Fuller, who had survived a loud appeal for caught behind off Tim Groenewald, hit the same bowler for successive sixes over extra cover in an over that cost 22.
His onslaught jolted Simpson into life, with the wicketkeeper taking up the chase after Fuller and Ollie Rayner fell in the same Jack Leach over.
Allenby was given the responsibility of the final over and with six needed from four balls, Simpson swept a leg-stump delivery over the longest boundary on the ground.
It completed a remarkable chase, one that Middlesex looked to have abandoned after Sam Robson, Dawid Malan, Gubbins and George Bailey fell in quick succession, all four to Groenewald, who finished with 5-90.
A sedate passage with Simpson and James Franklin at the crease followed, but Fuller arrived to make things happen, just as he had with the ball in the morning session.
He took all three wickets to fall before lunch, including Peter Trego, who made 138, for figures of 3-125.

It is the latest in a series of steps by Mr Abadi to ease sectarian tensions and crack down on corruption.
Baghdad has seen weeks of protests over poor services and abuses of power.
Earlier this month, in a rare show of unity, the Iraqi parliament backed Mr Abadi's programme to abolish top government posts and cut spending.
On Friday, the prime minister issued instructions to lift restrictions on the Green Zone. It is not clear when the plan will be implemented.
The compound, in the Karkh district on the west bank of the Tigris, is surrounded by concrete walls and heavily guarded by checkpoints and tanks.
It houses former palaces of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and was the administrative headquarters of the US occupation authorities. Several foreign embassies, including those of the US and UK, are situated there.
Most Iraqis have been excluded from the Green Zone unless they have special permission, and large bribes have been paid to get round stringent entry procedures, according to AFP news agency.
The zone has been targeted by bombings and rockets over the years, and the fortification measures were aimed at making it more secure, although attacks in Baghdad are still commonplace.
Mr Abadi also ordered the removal of barriers and checkpoints set up on main roads and sidestreets in Baghdad and elsewhere by prominent figures and militias.
The order to lift the restrictions is part of a series of measures to defuse tensions and root out corruption. A panel will also be set up to recover state property appropriated by elites which are found to have been illegally obtained.

"Resuming in a strong position at 182-3, the tourists were bundled out for 242 in a dreadful morning session in Dubai.
Joe Root, Ben Stokes and the out-of-form Jos Buttler fell victim to Wahab Riaz's pace, before Yasir Shah's leg-spin bamboozled the lower order.
By the close, Pakistan reached 222-3, a lead of 358 runs, with Misbah ul-Haq 87 not out and Younus Khan 71 not out.
After coming so close to winning the first Test, and contesting the first two days of this match fiercely, this was a hugely disappointing day for the tourists - and one that seriously imperils their chances of getting a result in this series.
Alastair Cook's men will have to hope they can dismiss the hosts quickly on day four, then set about a huge run chase - but their chances of avoiding defeat on a turning fourth-innings track with the wily Yasir in operation appear slim.
England's chances of getting close to, or even overhauling, Pakistan's first-innings total of 378 were always likely to depend on the influential Root - unbeaten on 76 overnight.
But the day got off to the worst possible when the Yorkshire batsman swished at a wide delivery from Wahab and was caught behind for 88.
From then on, England's increasing over-reliance on Root and Cook was horribly exposed as the remaining six wickets tumbled for only 30 runs.
Wahab, bowling with real hostility to exploit England's uncertainty against genuine pace, had Stokes (4) and Buttler (0) caught behind in quick succession in a superb spell of 3-15 in nine overs.
Then it was over to Yasir - bowling in tandem with Wahab for the first 18 overs of the day - who justified his status as the world's top-ranked spin bowler with a display of high-class leg-spin.
Memories of England's awful performances against spin on their last tour of the UAE were revived as Adil Rashid (0), Jonny Bairstow (46) and Mark Wood (1) all perished with poor shots to Yasir.
After conceding a first-innings lead of 136, England desperately needed early wickets, and their seamers got two quick breakthroughs.
James Anderson dismissed Shan Masood (1) for the fourth time in the series before Shoaib Malik (7) was bowled trying to drive Mark Wood.
But England could not capitalise on that good start as their spinners struggled.
Mohammad Hafeez smashed Moeen Ali and Root for sixes before he was caught at slip off Wood for 51.
That brought first-innings centurion Misbah to the crease with Younus - a partnership with a combined age of 78 and one that has thwarted England throughout this series.
Playing cautiously against the seamers and looking to dominate the spinners, the duo - who have now put on a fifty partnership in nine out of the last 10 occasions they have been at the crease together - batted England further and further out of contention.
To win, the tourists will have to surpass the highest-ever fourth-innings chase at Dubai - 137 - and record at least the fifth-highest run-chase this century.
While Stokes is averaging just 24 since the start of the Ashes and Bairstow remains without a Test century, it is the form of Buttler that is the biggest concern in England's malfunctioning middle order.
The wicketkeeper - whose average after his first eight Tests was 52.67 - is averaging just 13.55 in his last seven matches against Australia and Pakistan, with 149 runs in 11 innings.
""Buttler's numbers are not good,"" said former England captain Michael Vaughan on Test Match Special. ""He's got a huge problem: he's not lining up the ball, he's playing it two feet away from his body.""
In addition, even his usually reliable keeping faltered as he dropped a simple chance presented by Shan Masood off the bowling of Stuart Broad, and saw another chance fly between him and Joe Root at first slip.
Bairstow is also capable of taking the gloves and James Taylor could replace Buttler in the middle order should England decide to change their side for the third Test in Sharjah.
Ex-England spinner Graeme Swann on BBC Test Match Special: ""I think there will be two changes [for the next Test]. The way they're going, they're going to lose unless something ridiculous happens.
""Barring a big score from Buttler or Bell, I think they'll be asked to sit out the last Test. That will allow you to bring in an opening batsman in Alex Hales, and James Taylor at three, with Moeen Ali moving to seven. He's not an opening bat, he showed in Abu Dhabi it's not his natural game.""
Michael Vaughan on BBC Test Match Special: ""My frustration with England is that they keep having these horrible sessions that lose them the game. Losing seven wickets for 36 runs... it's over. You can say I'm being negative but this game is done.""",England require their best-ever fourth-innings run chase to beat Pakistan in the second Test after a dire third day.

"Sandy Hamilton, 35, and Kevin James McKinley, 46, both of Larkhall, South Lanarkshire, were pulled from the water off the Galloway coast on Sunday.
BBC Scotland understands that both men were suspected by the authorities of involvement in the illegal puppy trade.
Mr Hamilton also faced trial over the deaths of two people in a road crash.
He was accused of causing death by dangerous driving after a head-on crash killed 85-year-old Giovanni Coppolaro and his wife Maria, 83, from St Ives, Cambridgeshire, in July 2015.
Mr Hamilton and Mr McKinley were reported missing on Saturday evening after failing to return from a boat trip from Port Logan, Wigtownshire.
Police confirmed on Sunday that their bodies had been recovered from the Irish Sea.
Officers are still trying to determine the circumstances surrounding their deaths.
BBC Scotland has learned that both men were known to the authorities in connection with the illegal trade of puppies from the Republic of Ireland.
A major route for the trade sees vehicles transporting puppies across the Irish sea by ferry into Scotland.
A BBC Panorama investigation into the trade - Britain's Puppy Dealers Exposed - was broadcast last year.
The programme obtained footage which showed Sandy Hamilton being stopped in September 2015 on a ferry from Northern Ireland.
A concealment of puppies was found in the boot of his car and on that occasion he was allowed to continue on his journey and keep the dogs.
The stop was carried out by the Scottish SPCA as part of Operation Delphin.
This multi-agency initiative, which includes Stena Line, Police Scotland, Trading Standards and HM Revenue and Customs was set up to tackle the puppy trade business and protect the welfare of puppies and their breeding.
It is now believed that Mr Hamilton and Mr McKinley may have been on their way to collect more puppies in a speedboat at the weekend when the fatal accident happened.
BBC Scotland understands that Mr Hamilton's body was recovered, along with a substantial amount of cash.
Police Scotland would not comment.
A Scottish SPCA undercover inspector told the BBC: ""Puppy trafficking has been monitored for some time under Operation Delphin and we have identified a particular route between Scotland and Ireland.
""Operation Delphin has gained success tackling the illegal trade involving puppy trafficking in an attempt to improve animal welfare.
""We have seen the perpetrators develop more elaborate ways to source puppies undetected.""
Mr Hamilton was due to stand trial on the death by dangerous driving charge in July 2017.
Mr and Mrs Coppolaro had been travelling in a Jaguar car on the A73 in North Lanarkshire when it was hit by a Volkswagen Golf being driven by Mr Hamilton.
He had denied overtaking a lorry on a bend when it was unsafe to do so.
Mr Hamilton was also accused of driving without insurance.","Two men who died in a speedboat accident off the west coast of Scotland at the weekend were suspected puppy smugglers, it has emerged."
"Burgess went over to put the visitors ahead and the boot of George Williams ensured they led 8-4 at the break despite Vincent Duport's try.
After the restart Duport scored in the corner as Catalans took a 10-8 lead.
But Burgess put Wigan back ahead and further tries by Williams and Sam Tomkins followed by another Burgess effort saw Wigan home.
The Warriors move up to seventh, four points clear of ninth-placed Warrington with two games remaining before the Super 8s. And they are now four points behind fourth-placed Hull - and the top four spot that would give them the chance to defend their title.
Catalans are 10th, four points behind Huddersfield, who are eighth.
A Wigan win or any sorts looked in doubt when Duport collected a last-tackle kick to go over, with Luke Walsh adding the two points to give the French side their two-point advantage.
But Wigan, who were without coach Shaun Wane as he recovers after a hip operation, then dominated.
A brilliant team try ended with Burgess going over in the corner and Williams skipped through to give them a 10-point lead.
A Tony Gigot error then gifted Tomkins the away side's fourth try and the Burgess treble came when he went over from close range.
Catalans head coach Steve McNamara: ""For 60 to 65 minutes, there was not a lot to choose between the two teams - in fact I think we were two tries to one up.
""It was really pleasing that we were in that contest but really disappointed with the last 15 minutes. I don't think we deserved that scoreline.
""Having said that, if you give Wigan those opportunities they'll take them and that's what they did. I think that our performance today was a whole lot better than our win over Leigh last weekend.
""We can take a lot of positives out of that and hopefully we can improve next week as much as we have this week going into next week's game against St Helens.""
Wigan assistant John Winder: ""I was really pleased with the result. For 60 minutes I thought it was a real arm wrestle and it was a really tough game.
""Both sides were very competitive. We just stuck at it and got through that 60-minute mark and things just started to open up for us.
""I thought we got what we deserved and we stuck with the process long enough and we managed to snag a couple of tries before the momentum went with us at the end.
""It was very hot out there and a really physical game. The quality of the game was really high, the opening 15 minutes saw both teams complete in the high eighties and there weren't a lot of errors.""

"Glen Hunt, from Conars Court in Londonderry, must spend 10 months in prison with a further 10 months on licence
The attack happened at his partner's home in the Shankill area of Belfast on 3 September last year.
A Belfast Crown Court judge described it as a ""shocking incident"".
The court was told that Hunt returned to his partner's home after spending the day watching band parades and drinking. Prior to going home, the father of three got into an altercation with his partner's brother, who he claimed assaulted him.
A prosecution barrister said Hunt returned in an ""intoxicated and agitated"" state.
Hunt's partner was upstairs, and while in the bathroom she felt a thud to her shoulder. A struggle between the couple then ensued, during which she was pushed into the bath. She them saw Hunt raise his hand, and he struck her twice with a hammer.
The barrister said the woman was able to get the hammer from Hunt, adding ""the struggle came to an end when her grandson came into the bathroom"".
She left with the toddler, reported the matter to police and later sought hospital treatment for two wounds. She required stitches for a cut to her forehead, and also suffered a chipped tooth and a wound to her lip.
Hunt handed himself in to police in Derry three days later, and during interview made the case that he had been assaulted by his partner's brother. He said that when he got home, his partner was on the phone with her brother and that he was ""in fear"".
He subsequently pleaded guilty to wounding the woman, and to possessing the hammer with intent to commit assault.
The court heard the hammer used was already in the house. It also emerged that while Hunt has a criminal record of 25 convictions, there were no convictions for violent offences.
A defence barrister said there was no history of domestic violence between the two, adding that when Hunt returned home drunk after being assaulted, he felt in fear.
Passing sentence, the judge said that the woman was traumatised by the attack, and ""continues to feel the after-effects of what was clearly a shocking incident"".",A 53-year-old man has been jailed for attacking his partner with a hammer in the presence of her three-year old grandson.

"The taskforce was appointed by the Social Development Minister Nelson McCausland.
It was asked to examine the impact of negative equity and repossessions.
The taskforce has warned that the number of people falling behind on their mortgage payments could increase as interest rates begin to rise.
The taskforce is now undertaking further work aimed at developing policy recommendations.
Northern Ireland suffered a huge housing bubble followed by a crash that saw prices fall by almost 50%.
As a consequence, rates of negative equity are much worse than elsewhere in the UK and repossessions have also increased.
A major ""at risk"" group identified by the taskforce are households who undertook ""equity release"" remortgages at the height of the market.
They are people who increased their mortgages to release cash for other purposes, such as home improvements or to finance buy-to-let properties.
In 2007, 74% of remortgaging in Northern Ireland was for equity release.
The taskforce said this category of ""credit hungry"" borrower was disproportionately active in Northern Ireland.
Lower income groups who took out ""second charge"" mortgages with subprime lenders are also at high-risk.
The taskforce said those lenders have shown ""a more tenacious approach to arrears management"".
However, it said, in general, lenders have shown ""forbearance"" and if they had not done so rates of repossessions would be higher.
The taskforce warned that, despite a gradual recovery in the Northern Ireland economy and the housing market, major risks remain.
It said that the Northern Ireland economy ""remains some distance from reaching escape velocity""' and that borrowers are ""poorly equipped to absorb future income shocks"".","The Northern Ireland housing market remains ""dysfunctional"" and poses a risk to economic recovery, a Stormont-backed taskforce has concluded."

"The towns of Virginia Water and Cobham, in Surrey, have become Britain's first million pound towns - where average house prices are more than £1m.
Beaconsfield in Buckinghamshire is also in the millionaire's club, according to research by Lloyds Bank.
They are the first towns outside London where prices have hit seven figures.
The research was based on data from the Land Registry for the first half of 2015.
Prices in Virginia Water - home to the likes of Sir Cliff Richard and Sir Bruce Forsyth - average no less than £1.169m, making it Britain's most expensive town outside the capital.
No wonder that the town's famous golf course, Wentworth, feels able to charge joining fees of £125,000. That is on top of the annual membership fee of £16,000.
Cobham - familiar to Chelsea footballers and their WAGS - has average prices of £1.043m.
And anyone wanting to buy in Beaconsfield can expect to pay £1.003m.
""We're seeing the emergence of towns where the average price is at least £1 million,"" said Sarah Deaves, private banking director at Lloyds Bank.
""Whilst there are several London neighbourhoods where prices are already at this elevated level, outside of the capital this is a first.""
However the figures also show a sharp slow-down in the number of homes sold for more than £1m.
In the first half of 2015 there were 5,599 such sales, down from 6,303 in 2014. That amounts to an 11% fall.
One reason for that is the change in Stamp Duty rates, introduced in December 2014.
The buyer of a £1m house will now pay £43,750 in Stamp Duty, up from £40,000 previously.","One has a golf course that charges £125,000 to become a member, and the other has a post office said to stock bottles of Bollinger and Dom Perignon."

"It is the first major competition the venue has hosted since under-going a post-Games makeover.
The venue looks amazing and we can't wait to get diving
Diver Daley relocated from Plymouth to the centre earlier this year and is part of a nine-strong GB squad.
""It's the first time the whole team has been back here and it's going to be pretty special,"" he told BBC Sport.
The venue, which hosted all of the aquatic disciplines at the London Games apart from water polo, cost more than £250m to build and had its capacity reduced from 18,000 to around 2,500 before it was re-opened to the public in February.
Although long-term Chinese rival Qui Bo is missing the event, Daley will face tough opposition in the form of US Olympic gold medallist David Boudia and world synchro champion Sascha Klein of Germany.

Daley is currently without a partner for the 10m synchronised platform competition and likely to skip the event at the Commonwealth Games, so teenage duo Daniel Goodfellow and Matty Lee lead the British challenge in the event.
""It's our first time in the pool as we weren't in the team for the Olympics, so we're really excited,"" Goodfellow told BBC Sport.
Lee, who has won two World Series bronze medals with his team-mate so far this season, added: ""Our partnership has clicked really quickly and we have a great relationship, which I think is behind our success so far.""

World champions Argentina went ahead through a penalty corner in the sixth minute and Carla Rebecchi got the crucial second just before the break.
Alex Danson got one back on 65 minutes but there was not enough time to break down a strong defence again.
Argentina will play reigning champions the Netherlands in the final on Friday.
The Dutch earlier beat New Zealand in a penalty shoot-out after a dramatic match ended 2-2 in normal time.
""Great Britain will be so disappointed. In this situation, if you can come off the pitch knowing that you gave absolutely everything and you just weren't good enough then you can take some kind of comfort in that. 2-0 down against the number two team in the world? It's a tough ask to come back and win it.
""GB gave it absolutely everything in the second half but they just weren't getting it into the Argentine circle and causing problems.""
Britain will have to console themselves with a bronze medal match against New Zealand and the opportunity to match the team of Barcelona 20 years ago.
""I thought we were the dominant side in the second half,"" said GB coach Danny Kerry.
""The reason for not winning was the half-chances, not converting the opportunity, but I couldn't have asked any more from the girls. I felt Argentina were really just defending, not offering much other than that, but they did that well.""
Argentina repeated the formula of rock-solid defence and clinical finishing which won them the Champions Trophy final on home soil against Great Britain in January.
They got off to the perfect start with their first attack when Noel Barrionuevo coolly converted a penalty corner.
From that moment on, the task was considerable for Great Britain. They had much of the possession without creating a real shooting opportunity until Danson attempted an ambitious reverse-stick finish on the half hour.
Rebecchi then made them pay when she linked up with Luciana Aymar's surging run down the left and forced the ball into the goal despite a strong challenge from two British defenders and keeper Beth Storry.
The second half was a more positive affair, with Crista Cullen getting an early penalty corner, but it was charged down by Macarena Rodriguez Perez.
Helen Richardson had the clearest chance in open play on 55 minutes when the ball fell to her in space in the 'D', but she snatched at her shot.

"The upper house cleared Mr Kuroda after he won approval from the lower house on Thursday.
Mr Kuroda has said he will do whatever it takes to bring inflation up to 2%.
Japan has seen 20 years of intermittent falling consumer prices, which analysts say has hurt its economy.
The upper house also voted to approve the appointment of Kikuo Iwata and Hiroshi Nakaso as deputies to Mr Kuroda, who is leaving his current job as president of the Asian Development Bank.
All three were nominated by new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who came into office on the promise of bringing Japan's economy out of its prolonged slump.
Mr Kuroda, who has long been a critic of the central bank's policies, is a supporter of Mr Abe's plan to ease monetary policy and increase government spending.
""This is kind of an experiment,"" said Masayuki Kichikawa from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. ""It's worth trying,"" he adds.
Mr Kuroda and Mr Iwata have said they are in favour of buying government debt with longer maturities in order to achieve the central bank's new inflation target of 2%.
Deflation, or falling prices, discourages investment and spending by businesses and consumers, and makes debts more difficult to repay.
The three will take control of the central bank after current governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, steps down on 19 March.
Mr Kuroda's stance marks a stark contrast to that of Mr Shirakawa, who was not a proponent of aggressive monetary easing.
In the run-up to the change of the leadership, the Japanese economy has been showing positive signs.
The yen has fallen more than 20% against the US dollar, which is a relief for exporters. A strong yen makes them less competitive abroad.
The stock market has also surged, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 index rising 27% in the last three months.
The economy expanded slightly in the last quarter of 2012, instead of an expected shrinking, as Japan emerged from its latest recession.","Japan's parliament has approved Haruhiko Kuroda as governor of the Bank of Japan, who is expected to push for monetary stimulus to boost growth in the world's third-largest economy."
"But on the 100th anniversary of the 10 October 1911 rebellion that sprang from the Xinhai Revolution, which ended 2,000 years of imperial rule and ushered Chinese people into a modern era, mention of the ROC is rare - except in Taiwan.
In mainland China, the anniversary will be marked by mostly official activities that focus on the revolution and Sun Yat-sen, who inspired it, not the founding of the republic or Sun's principles of democracy.
That is because the Communist Party, which had nothing to do with the revolution, does not want to give much credit to the ROC and its founders, the Nationalists (or Kuomintang, KMT).
The two sides later fought a bloody civil war that ended with the Kuomintang fleeing to Taiwan in the late 1940s and re-establishing the republic there.
But in Taiwan, the government - currently led by the Kuomintang - is sparing no efforts to make sure the world does not forget the 100th birthday of the republic.
""It was the biggest event in China's 5,000-year history and a major change in political system which established the first republic in Asia,"" said the Kuomintang's historical archives director Shao Ming-huang.
""That planted the seeds of rebellion in Asia against foreign forces' control,"" he said, saying one of the reasons why Sun wanted to overthrow the Qing was because it was too weak to fend off foreign invasions.
On the island, the anniversary is being celebrated with much fanfare on Monday. A 40-minute fireworks show is planned in central Taiwan. Fireworks will also light up the skies in other areas, including Taipei.
Many ordinary people watched the flag-raising ceremony in the morning and the subsequent activities, including a military parade involving more than 1,000 military personnel, 71 aircraft and 168 vehicles.
Numerous couples got married in a mass wedding, and President Ma Ying-jeou made a speech. Even tourists were reminded - those arriving on Monday were presented with a centennial souvenir gift.
But on the eve of the anniversary, the legacy of the ROC is inevitably debated.
Some people blame it for corruption and incompetence which led to it losing mainland China to the Communists in the civil war.
And in Taiwan, a still significant segment of the population views the KMT and ROC with resentment because of suppressive rule after relocating to Taiwan in the 1940s.
Beijing cautious on centenary
It is blamed for the 2/28 Incident in 1947 (an uprising sparked by the beating of a female vendor that lead to deadly riots) and a subsequent crackdown against dissidents known as the White Terror, which led to thousands of people being arrested, tortured, killed or persecuted. Martial law was not lifted until 1987.
""The ROC is a Chinese government exiled in Taipei. It should be out of Taiwan,"" said Tsay Ting-kuei, who is one of a group of people who believe that when Japan lost WWII, Taiwan technically should not have been handed over to the ROC because that was not specified in the treaties signed between Japan and the Western victors in the war.
Yeh Tsai-chu, a business woman, said she and her family will not be celebrating the anniversary - also known as Double Ten National Day.
""The ROC's 100th anniversary has nothing to do with Taiwan. Besides, what is there to celebrate? The ROC is not even recognised as a country by the rest of the world,"" Ms Yeh said.
She is referring to the fact that the ROC lost its seat in the United Nations in 1971 to the People's Republic of China.
Taiwan's government and most people, however, strongly believe the ROC is a legitimate, sovereign country, despite claims to the contrary by China and only about 20 mostly small countries officially recognising it as such.
Ahead of the anniversary, passers-by expressed genuine pride in not only Taiwan but also the ROC. Many of them were descendants of long-time Taiwanese, not Chinese immigrants who came here after the war in the 1940s.
""It's done some good and bad, but it's mostly good. It raised Taiwan's living standards and the best thing is, it allowed Taiwan to become an open and free society,"" said Kevin Wun, 26, a financial risk manager.
Many people also credit the ROC with saving Taiwan from a Communist takeover and helping the island become a prosperous economy and thriving democracy.
""What happened in the past has passed. Taiwan is the ROC, we've sung our national anthem for so many years. We're made up of longtime Taiwanese, more recent immigrants from China and South East Asian brides. We have such a free society today,"" said Chai-yun Lee, who is in her 60s.
Pressed for an answer, a Chinese tourist visiting Taiwan also agreed that perhaps the ROC's legacy may be more good than bad.
""We recognise Sun Yat-sen. We recognise the Xinhai Revolution, but not Double Ten National Day and not the ROC, but the ROC did more good than bad; it overthrew the emperors,"" said a Chinese woman who declined to be named.
Despite the dark chapters in its history of rule in Taiwan, many Taiwanese people recognise the ROC as Taiwan, although they might define it differently from the ruling party.
""The ROC is Taiwan. It doesn't include the mainland,"" said Sidney Cheng.
""We're very proud of ourselves. Our country has a lot of great things, such as democracy, its high-tech industry, its economy and its friendly people.""
The relevance of the ROC, however, could face threats in the future.
Mr Cheng and others noted when they travel abroad, people including customs officers are confused by what the ROC stands for, thinking it is China.
""When I went to Brazil, they stamped on my visa that I was Chinese,"" said Mr Cheng.
Most people overseas know Taiwan as Taiwan, not the Republic of China.
But the KMT's chief historian Mr Shao insists the ROC's relevance will not diminish with time.
""The ROC not only achieved Dr Sun's ideals of nationalism, democracy and livelihood for the Chinese race [in Taiwan], things that have not been achieved by China, it will also play a very important role in eventually resolving the differences between Taiwan and mainland China,"" Mr Shao said.
""Even China has some feelings for it, because it was created by Sun Yat-sen and they respect Sun Yat-sen.""
But the ROC's road to democracy is not complete.
On the eve of the centennial, an indigenous tribe in Taiwan vowed to carry out a symbolic headhunt of the ROC - to express frustration at its history of not respecting indigenous people's rights.
But such an activity would not be tolerated in mainland China, and such is the legacy of the ROC.","One of the most important events of the 20th Century was the overthrow of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, and the founding of the Republic of China (ROC)."
"Sir Philip Bailhache, then Jersey's attorney general, supervised Roger Holland's appointment to the honorary police in 1992.
Holland had been convicted of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl with learning difficulties in 1986, when he worked for St John Ambulance.
Sir Philip said he had not known before Holland's inauguration.
Holland was jailed for two years in 2008 for eight sexual offences, some of which were committed while he was in the honorary force.
Despite including the 1986 conviction on his application form, he was elected to the St Helier honorary police in 1992, where he held office for another six years.
Sir Philip said he was only informed of Holland's conviction after the election, and ""it was reasonable to conclude he had been re-habilitated"".
""What Holland did was put his hand up a girl's pullover. It was an unpleasant thing to do but across the range of sexual offences it was at the lower end of the scale."", he said.
The Jersey Care Inquiry is investigating allegations of child abuse in Jersey's care system since 1945.
Sir Philip, Jersey's current external relations minister, also denied he deliberately distracted attention from abuse victims in a speech he gave in 2008.
He told people on Liberation Day :""All child abuse is scandalous but it is the unjustified and remorseless denigration of Jersey and her people that is the real scandal.""
Sir Philip told the inquiry he was not ""diminishing the gravity of child abuse"" but that his choice of words were possibly ""unfortunate"".","A former senior judge was ""not aware"" a man was a convicted sex offender when he was admitted to a voluntary police force, an inquiry has heard."

What is behind South Sudan army clashes?
The whereabouts of Mr Machar are unclear. He told the BBC he was still in South Sudan and was ""not going to leave the country"".
He blamed Sunday's fighting on a conflict between members of the presidential guard, and said it spread across parts of the capital, Juba.
He added that government troops used the incident to arrest some of his supporters on Monday, and that he himself escaped.
""Salva wanted to frame me,"" he said. ""I had to flee. They are hunting me down.""
Mr Machar said his disagreement with Mr Kiir was on reform of the SPLM, which the president had rejected.
""So we are asking him to resign and leave the presidency,"" Mr Machar said.
Mr Kiir said he was willing to enter into talks with Mr Machar but said he did not know what the result would be.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon on Wednesday welcomed the offer, saying he was ""deeply concerned"" about the situation in the country.
He said that this was ""a political crisis that needs to be dealt with through political dialogue"" and that there was a risk of the violence spreading further.
Mr Ban confirmed that some 20,000 people had taken refuge in the UN mission in Juba, and several hundred more in Jonglei state.
French UN ambassador Gerard Araud, who holds the rotating presidency of the Security Council, said the conflict had ""the potential of a civil war"" between the two main ethnic bodies, the Dinka - Mr Kiir's group - and the Nuer, from which Mr Machar hails.
Information Minister Micheal Makuei Lueth confirmed to the Associated Press that at least 500 people, mostly soldiers, had been killed.
There were reports that fighting had continued on Monday and Tuesday near the presidential palace and many other areas of Juba.
On Wednesday a businessman living in Juba, Muhammad Waqas ur-Rehman, told the BBC the city was tense and that he and many others were trying to leave.
There were also reports of people fleeing clashes in Bor, the capital of Jonglei state, about 150km (90 miles) to the north.
The South Sudan Red Cross Society said at least 19 people were killed in overnight fighting there.
However, presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny told the BBC that government forces were in full control of Juba and all other cities, and that there were no major engagements.
Riek Machar in profile
Mr Ateny played down the prospect of civil war and said that while it was likely that civilians had been caught in the fighting, no-one was ""targeting ethnic groups"".
BBC world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge says it remains to be seen what impact such government assurances will have in what has been a tense and volatile situation.
The UK's Foreign Office said it was pulling some of its embassy staff out of Juba ""due to the current instability"".
It said the embassy remained open but that it now advised ""against all travel to Jonglei state and Juba"".
The US has suspended embassy operations and on Wednesday flew out 120 evacuees, including 28 foreign diplomats, on two C-130 aircraft.
On Tuesday, the South Sudan government said former Finance Minister Kosti Manibe, former Justice Minister John Luk Jok and former Interior Minister Gier Chuang Aluong were among 10 opposition figures who had been arrested.
Many were members of the cabinet that was sacked in its entirety in July.
South Sudan has struggled to achieve a stable government since becoming independent from Sudan in 2011.
The independence referendum was intended to end a decade-long conflict, led by the SPLM, against the north. But the oil-rich country remains ethnically and politically divided, with many armed groups active.
After a peace deal was signed in 2005, the southern rebel group appointed Mr Machar as vice-president of the South Sudan regional government, a position he retained after independence in 2011 until he was dropped in July.",Fugitive former South Sudanese vice-president Riek Machar has denied government allegations that he tried to stage a coup at the weekend.
"He has launched a consultation to try to find agreement on how universities should be paid for.
The consultation has been called the 'Big Conversation'.
Speaking in the assembly, Mr Farry said that Northern Ireland was the only part of the UK actively ""disinvesting"" in higher education.
The consultation process will involve a number of events and online presentations in order to seek opinion from students, university staff, unions and the wider public.
Just under 40% of funding for Queen's University, Belfast (QUB) and Ulster University comes directly from Stormont's Department for Employment and Learning (DEL).
However, the universities faced cuts of more than £16m in funding from DEL in 2015/16, which followed cuts in funding during previous years.
Ulster University is shedding about 200 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,200 student places over the next three years, while Queen's University announced in April that it was cutting 236 jobs in 2015/16 and 1,010 student places over the next three years.
Ulster University also closed a number of courses and departments including their School of Modern Languages at Coleraine, County Londonderry.
The universities also draw about 30% of their annual funding from student tuition fees, which are currently £3,805 per year for students from Northern Ireland.
Some students also study for degrees at further education colleges, and that budget was also reduced this year by about £12m.
DEL's budget was reduced by £62m earlier this year, and its budget for higher education institutions fell from £203m to £186m, a reduction of 8.2%.
Mr Farry said that, given its importance to the local economy and the fact that just under half of young people in Northern Ireland entered higher education, the status quo was no longer an option.
During subsequent questions, a number of MLAs including Phil Flanagan of Sinn Féin, Jim Allister of the Tradition Unionist Voice (TUV) and Basil McCrea of NI21, expressed concern about a possible rise in tuition fees.
In response, Mr Farry said that he had an ""open mind"" and that ""this is not a conversation about whether we have fees or don't have fees"".
""All options have to be on the table and fees are only one of many options facing us. This is not a done deal process.""
The consultation ends on 23 October, and Mr Farry said he wanted to present options to the Northern Ireland Executive in the autumn.","The way that higher education is funded in Northern Ireland is ""no longer sustainable"", Employment and Learning Minister Stephen Farry has said."
"Merseyside Police were called to Crete Towers on Jason Street, Everton, on Tuesday morning after someone noticed a strong smell coming from the building.
It comes two weeks after one of the biggest ever cannabis farms in Liverpool was found on the same street.
Police estimate the total crop had a street value of more than £1.3m and described the farms ""a sophisticated and industrial-scale criminal set-up"".
Det Insp Lee Wilkinson said: ""This was an elaborate series of cannabis farms spread across four separate flats.
""We discovered a total of 339 plants but believe much more could have been grown.""",Four cannabis farms have been found in flats at a tower block in Liverpool.
"Recordings released on paid-subscription platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music and Tidal will now qualify.
Nominees previously had to be available on a CD, or downloadable.
Grammy members will also vote in fewer categories, the Recording Academy announced.
The changes will come into force in time for next February's awards.
Bill Freimuth, the Academy's senior vice president of awards, said: ""We noticed that there were a number of higher-profile artists who were choosing - for philosophical reasons as much as anything - to release their music through streaming-only, and we did not want to be exclusionary toward them.""
Some musicians, including Prince and Beyonce, have released debuts exclusively on Tidal, before then releasing them on iTunes and other platforms.
Grammy members will also have the number of categories they can vote in reduced from 20 to 15. However all members will still be able to vote in the top four categories: album of the year, song of the year, record of the year and best new artist.
Other changes include an update for the best new artist category. Rules now allow a performer who releases at least five singles to qualify. Previously, acts had to release an album to be eligible. Acts can qualify for best new artist until they have released three albums or 30 singles.
The best rap/sung collaboration, which was given to rap and R&B acts who team up on a track, is being renamed to best rap/sung performance, and can now be given to solo acts.
Best blues album has also been split into two categories: best traditional blues album and best contemporary blues album.
Freimuth added: ""The effort here is to protect the integrity of the Grammy Awards, and so sometimes that means typing up some rules, and sometimes that means loosening up some rules, sometimes that means contracting a category, sometimes that means adding a category.""
This year's awards saw Taylor Swift's 1989 win the coveted album of the year award.
The singer - who is the first woman to win the award twice - also won best pop vocal album and best music video, for her track Bad Blood.
Rapper Kendrick Lamar won the most prizes on the night with five awards.
British singer Ed Sheeran also won his first two Grammys for song of the year and best pop solo performance, for his number one hit Thinking Out Loud.
Songs need to have been released between 1 October 2015 and 30 September 2016 to be eligible for next year's awards. The nominations will be announced on 6 December.","Songs released only on streaming services are to be eligible for Grammy nominations for the first time, as part of changes to the music awards' rules."
"As reported by The Sun, a utility worker had planned to buy a Persimmon Homes property near Colchester.
But he pulled out after learning a clause in the contract meant he would not be able to park his van outside.
The town's Conservative MP Will Quince said the ban ""seemed unreasonable"". Persimmon has yet to respond to the BBC.
LIVE: For more on this and other Essex stories
It is understood the restrictive covenant on homes in the new Oakwood Meadows development also bans boats and caravans from being parked either on the property or out on the road.
Mr Quince said: ""I am a former property solicitor and am well used to these kinds of covenants and there's always a reason why they are included.
""The commercial vehicle one has always seemed unreasonable to me, particularly in a county like Essex which is an entrepreneurial county and many of those people will operate out of vans.
""They cannot always afford to own a car as well so effectively you're saying van drivers are not welcome in Essex which is a particularly snobby attitude.""
Commonly used restrictive covenants can dictate parking arrangements, letting, the display of advertising posters on property and pets.
Restrictive covenants are not only imposed on commercial or other large vehicles.
Residents on a new development in Beverley, East Yorkshire, for example, are subject to a covenant banning them from hanging out the washing or airing clean clothes outdoors.
Covenants prohibiting hanging washing in the front garden are not uncommon, but the one at Westwood Park covers windows, balconies, roof terraces, communal gardens and potentially even the back gardens of individual houses on the site.
The developers, though, did fit every home with a washer-dryer to help the enforcement of the covenant.
Other common covenants prevent occupiers from erecting fences in their front garden, keeping livestock other than domestic pets, washing their cars on the premises and removing any grassed areas.
Covenants can also be imposed on who can buy a property. In Wales, for example, a covenant on a home in Maentwrog meant it could only be bought by a local person.","A housing developer has been accused of ""snobbery"" for banning traders from parking vans outside their homes."
"In a statement
, Nato described Saudi-born Sakhar al-Taifi as the group's second most senior figure in Afghanistan.
He commanded foreign insurgents and directed attacks against coalition and Afghan forces, the statement said.
But Taliban sources in Kunar deny Al-Taifi was killed and claim he left the area three months ago.
Sakhar al-Taifi died in ""a precision air strike"" in the Watapur district of Kunar province on Sunday night, according to the Nato statement. Another rank-and-file member of al-Qaeda was killed at the same time, it said.
But Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told the Afghan Islamic Press news agency that a bombing raid in the area had killed two Afghan Taliban.
""There are no al-Qaeda fighters in Watapur and no foreign national was killed there,"" he said.
Al-Taifi, who also went by the names of Mustaq and Nasim, arranged for weapons and insurgent fighters to be transported into Afghanistan, Nato says.
He reportedly had strong links to Taliban fighters in the area.
Senior intelligence officials have told the BBC's Bilal Sarwary that al-Taifi had expertise in making roadside bombs and suicide vests, but that he also funded and trained suicide attackers in Kunar.
Al-Taifi replaced the al-Qaeda commander Abu Ikhlas al-Masri who was captured in Afghanistan's volatile Kunar province.
Nato estimates that there are fewer than 100 al-Qaeda operatives in the country. However, the border with Pakistan where the fighters operate is porous, says the BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Kabul.
Troops on the ground often report hearing the voices of Arabic-speaking insurgents over radios - when they do, immediate attacks are launched against those sites, he says.
Kunar has always been known as a crucible of conflict - a haven for millitants in the north-eastern corner of Afghanistan and bordering Pakistan's tribal areas.
Correspondents say it is one of the first ports of call for insurgents crossing the mountain passes from Pakistan.
Among the many  
          documents seized from the compound
 of Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan after he was killed last May was a letter to Atiya Abdul Rahman, al-Qaeda's top operational planner, in which the al-Qaeda leader advised militants to seek refuge in Kunar because of its terrain.
""Kunar is more fortified due to its rougher terrain and many mountains, rivers and trees, and it can accommodate hundreds of the brothers without being spotted by the enemy. This will defend the brothers from the aircraft,"" he wrote.","One of the most senior al-Qaeda figures in Afghanistan was killed in a weekend air strike, Nato-led forces say."
"The Powys community, near Brecon, which has about 1,000 residents, is the only ward in Wales where no-one wants to stand as a councillor.
It is set to go unrepresented on Thursday as voters across Wales go to the polls for the local elections.
But why does nobody want to represent Yscir?
Elsewhere in Wales, there are 92 uncontested seats, where councillors will be returned without any votes being cast, but Yscir currently stands alone as being unrepresented.
Incumbent Gillian Thomas, one of several independent councillors in Powys, is retiring and, so far, no-one wants to replace her.
And the impending void is news to some people.
Retired couple Tess and Brian Birtles, of Aberyscir, had not heard their ward would be left without a voice.
Mr Birtles, a former communications firm boss, said he was disappointed, adding: ""Powys could have done more to encourage people to stand in the ward, because ultimately it will mean that we're not represented at the local government.""
Still, he does not want the job himself.
""I'd find it immensely frustrating,"" he said, ""because it doesn't seem very much is done by the councils these days apart from cutting services and reducing costs.""
""It's quite sad"", Mrs Birtles added, speculating people might not want to stand ""because we're not suffering the austerity measures that some areas are experiencing"" with many of the residents retirees.
People, in Yscir, she said, were ""living the good life"".
But that is not to say they all think it is rosy in the garden.
There have been complaints about changes to waste services, while the decision to close Welsh-medium stream at Brecon High School has also sparked debate.
Ms Thomas, 79, said it was ""not good for democracy"" no-one had put their name forward.
""When I won the last election I said that would be my last term,"" she said. ""My age is getting on, and I want to do things I want to do.""
Ms Thomas, who had previously had a farm in the ward before moving to Brecon, said she had found the job ""very rewarding"".
""When my husband died very suddenly at an early age, it really saved me that I had an outside interest,"" she said.
So, what is putting people off taking up the cudgels in Ms Thomas' absence?
""I think it's quite big shoes to fill,"" said Valerie Davies, who has lived with her husband, Peter, in Aberyscir for eight years.
She said the lack of a willing replacement was a ""sad reflection"" on the community, but also questioned who would want to join a club ""being continually attacked by the rest of the populace"".
Mr Davies - 35-year army veteran who, like his wife, is now retired - said most people's dealings with the council concerned planning.
""It wasn't advertised or publicised that nobody was standing,"" he added.
He said he might consider it, but added: ""The dealings I've had with parish councils over the years, it always ends up looking a bit petty.""
What about younger residents?
Eliot Lawrence, 32, of nearby Cradoc, was also unaware of the vacancy.
""It's not ideal, really,"" he said. ""I've not got any major, pressing concerns, but if something did happen and there's no-one to fight for it, it would be an issue then.""
But he admitted he would not consider battling for the seat, adding: ""It's not something that interests me really.""
Colin Badhan, 76, who runs a B&B in Battle, also did not fancy the job.
""When I get the local magazine pushed through the door it all seems pretty petty stuff, to me anyway,"" he added.
While fellow Battle resident Jennifer Puttick was ""shocked"" no-one was standing, she could understand why.
""Maybe a lot of people are wising up. There's not a lot you can do now,"" she said. ""There's rules and regulations already set in place.""
But residents' reasons for not throwing their hats into the ring seem no more exotic than those you might find across Wales.
So, it is just...
There are 92 uncontested wards across Wales this year - where not enough people have been nominated to trigger an election and where those nominated are elected by default.
And Powys also has the second largest number of these - 16 - behind Gwynedd's 21.
A rural county, Powys' HQ is situated 25 miles (40km) from Aberyscir in Llandrindod Wells.
One senior political figure at the authority said it meets during the day and not the evening, due to distances members have to travel, and this reduces the candidate pool.
Jessica Blair of Electoral Reform Society Cymru said: ""Rural areas do see higher rates of uncontested seats and there are likely numerous factors for this, such as geography and smaller population size.""
But she pointed out Scotland, with fewer councillors over a larger geographical area, had only three uncontested seats. She argued it was an indicator of the ""health of local democracy and a failure of councils to modernise their approach to working in rural areas"".
Steve Thomas, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association, said he was unsurprised there were uncontested seats in rural areas and distances were ""an issue"".
But he said the lack of political organisations had an impact - with the prevalence of independent candidates ""who rely solely on their own resources"" proving a differentiating factor from some other elections in other parts of Wales.
For its part, Powys said timings for meetings would be reviewed after the elections, with views sought from councillors.
To fill the Yscir post, Powys will need to re-open the nominations and hold a separate election later in 2017.
In the meantime, the little ward, with its assortment of opinions, concerns, frustrations and voices, will remain silent in the council chamber.","It is picturesque, with stunning views of Pen y Fan and a charming rural setting, but Yscir has a unique problem."
"Georgina Edmonds, 77, was found dead after being tortured at her home near Eastleigh in Hampshire in 2008.
Matthew Hamlen, of nearby Bishopstoke, told the court he was ""not an expert"" but said if DNA found on the blouse was his ""it didn't get there at the time"".
Mr Hamlen, 36, denies murder in the trial at Winchester Crown Court.
Prosecutors claim DNA found on Mrs Edmonds's clothing and on the rolling pin was that of Mr Hamlen.
He was asked: ""The matching results are approximately 26 million-times more likely if the DNA has originated from you, than if it is from someone unrelated to you - how did it get there?""
Mr Hamlen replied: ""I know I didn't do this, I could not do something like this.
""As far as the DNA goes, I'm not an expert. All I can tell you is, it didn't get there at the time, if it is mine.""
The jury was previously shown CCTV footage of a man in a high-visibility jacket attempting to withdraw money with Mrs Edmonds's debit card on the day she was killed.
When asked if it was him in the images, Mr Hamlen replied: ""No.""
During cross-examination, the defendant was also asked about his relationship with his partner at the time of the killing.
He admitted it had not been good, that his partner had been violent, and he told police in an interview that during one incident he hit her around the face with an ironing board ""a few times"".
The 36-year-old is on trial for murder for a second time after being acquitted of the same crime in 2012.
The trial continues.",A man accused of beating a pensioner to death with a marble rolling pin has cast doubt over the reliability of DNA evidence found on the victim's blouse.
"Since 2010 there have been more than 1,800 reports of attacks involving corrosive fluids in the capital.
It is thought acid is becoming a preferred weapon for gangs due to its ease to obtain and lack of trail to the perpetrator.
Last year it was used in 454 crimes, compared to 261 in 2015, according to Met Police figures obtained by the BBC.
Almost a third of these attacks were carried out in the borough of Newham in east London.
Men are twice as likely to be victims of acid attacks in London than women, it was found.
The vast majority of cases never reach trial, according to the figures.
Since 2014 about 74% of investigations have been wound down due to problems with identifying perpetrators, or victims being unwilling to press charges.
According to figures obtained through a Freedom of Information request to the Metropolitan Police Service ""corrosive fluids"" were used in murders, robberies and rapes.
Wayne Ingold was attacked in 2014 in a case of mistaken identity after opening the door to a teenager.
""The pain on my face was indescribable. My face was melting and turning yellow,"" he told BBC London.
""One of the police officers was physically sick when he saw my face.
""Internally I'm scarred as well. For ages I was scared of reprisals. I had to move because of it and lost my home.
""It turned out the boy who did it was 15, and a convicted dealer of cocaine.""
Since the start of 2017 there have been 49 crimes where ""corrosive fluids"" were thrown with ""intent to cause grievous bodily harm"" or to ""cause an explosion"".
Dr Simon Harding, Criminologist and expert on gangs at Middlesex University, said there was anecdotal evidence gangs are switching from carrying knives to acid.
""It's not prohibitive to carry bleach, you can buy it online or any DIY stores, it's difficult to prove any illegal motive in carrying it and you can hide it or disguise it in a drink bottle,"" he said.
""A knife attack is attempted murder, but if you're caught in an acid attack it would be GBH.
""There's no specific offence regarding acid attacks"" he added.","The number of acid attacks in London has risen sharply in the past four years, according to new figures."
"A team from America have looked at how ants have evolved and found that the insects had complex underground farms, growing different types of fungi.
Not only that, the ants had taken fungus from its natural environment to nests in much drier climates.
The fungus couldn't survive without the ants so it is a very early example of agriculture.
Agriculture is what we call the practice of farming. Such as preparing soil for growing crops and raising animals for food and other products such as wool.
Dr Ted Schultz who specialises in ants and works at the Museum of Natural History said that ""Ants have established a form of agriculture that provides all the nourishment needed for their societies using a single crop that is resistant to disease, pests and droughts at a scale and level of efficiency that rivals human agriculture.""
There are many species of farmer ant, over 250 have been found in tropical forests, deserts and grasslands in the Americas and the Caribbean.",Scientists have found out that ants began farming millions of years before humans did.

"Sundowns went to Uganda leading 2-1 from last weekend's home leg, with the Kampala City outfit buoyed by their away goal.
It was KCCA who went ahead in the second leg of the last-32 tie, leaving the defending champions stunned.
Geoffrey Sserunkuma, who had scored in all three of Kampala City's African Champions League games during this campaign, netted again after half an hour to make it 1-0 on the day and 2-2 on aggregate.
Crucially, because of their away-goal, that strike also meant that if the score stayed that way, KCCA would oust the holders and advance to the last sixteen.
However, the hosts' fairy-tale run came to an end ten minutes from time when substitute Anthony Laffor of Liberia smashed the ball into the net to equalise and give Sundowns a 3-2 aggregate lead.
That was how the match ended, with Laffor later revealing what his coach Pitso Mosimane had urged him to do before coming off the bench.
""I'm happy to have been trusted to make the difference,"" Laffor said on Sundowns' official twitter feed.
""The coach said to me that I must get in the box and fight,"" the Liberian added.

"The 49-year-old Colorado native, whose legal pedigree includes Harvard and Oxford, would succeed the late Justice Antonin Scalia if confirmed.
He is favoured by many conservatives who consider him to espouse a similarly strict interpretation of law as Scalia.
Judge Gorsuch was first nominated to the 10th US Circuit Court of Appeals by former President George W Bush in 2006.
Judge Gorsuch began his law career clerking for Supreme Court Justices Byron White and Anthony Kennedy, the latter of whom he could now serve alongside.
He worked in a private law practice in Washington for a decade and served as the principal deputy assistant associate attorney general at the Justice Department under the Bush administration.
Judge Gorsuch graduated from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, where former President Barack Obama was a classmate, and earned a doctorate in legal philosophy at Oxford University.
Perhaps it was during his time in England that he accumulated what his former law partner, Mark Hansen, has said was ""an inexhaustible store"" of Winston Churchill quotes.
Judge Gorsuch - who reportedly likes to fly-fish and hunt - lives in Boulder with his wife Louise and two daughters, where he is also an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado.
If confirmed by the Senate, he would become the only Protestant on the current bench. The other justices are Jewish and Catholic.
His family is well-connected in Republican establishment politics.
His mother, Anne Gorsuch Burford, was the first female director of the Environmental Protection Agency during the Reagan administration.
He is known for his clear and concise writing style, navigating the most complex legal issues as deftly as the double-black diamond slopes on which he is reputedly an expert skier in the snow-capped mountain state he calls home.
Judge Gorsuch's published writings reveal his conservative leanings.
He argued against euthanasia in his 2006 book The Future of Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia.
""All human beings are intrinsically valuable and the intentional taking of human life by private persons is always wrong,"" he wrote.
In a 2005 article in the National Review, Judge Gorsuch argued that ""American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom"".
He said they keep ""relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda"".
Judge Gorsuch has never ruled on abortion, and he is not expected to call into question high-profile rulings on that issue or gay marriage.
His conservative outlook cements Mr Trump's campaign promise to nominate a judge ""in the mould"" of Justice Scalia, restoring the nine-seat high court's 5-4 conservative majority.
Much like the late Scalia, the Ivy-League educated judge is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text.
He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers.
While sitting on the bench of the 10th Circuit, Judge Gorsuch sided with groups that successfully challenged the Obama administration's requirements for employers to provide health insurance that includes contraception in the Hobby Lobby Stores v Sebelius case.
Judge Gorsuch has also expressed concern about ""executive overreach"", a criticism that was often directed at the Obama administration's use of presidential orders to overcome congressional gridlock.
He has sharply questioned a landmark Supreme Court ruling determining that courts should defer to government agencies when it comes to interpretations of ambiguous federal laws.
Conservatives blame the 1984 decision involving the Chevron oil company for handing too much power to the regulatory state.
In an August 2016 concurring opinion, Judge Gorsuch wrote that ""executive bureaucracies [were being allowed] to swallow huge amounts of core judicial and legislative power and concentrate federal power in a way that seems more than a little difficult to square with the Constitution of the framers' design"".
In a 2013 case, he upheld a lower court's ruling that a police officer was protected under qualified-immunity law after he used a stun gun on a 22-year-old student, who died from the incident.","President Trump's Supreme Court pick, Judge Neil Gorsuch, is the youngest such nominee in a quarter of a century."
"Money will be given to other projects, and potentially county football associations, if changes are not made, she told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek.
Crouch said: ""I'm not shy to say to the FA 'if you don't reform your governance structures, I will give that money to other bodies that deliver football'.""
She said the governing body receives £30m to £40m of public funding.
Earlier this month, former FA chairman David Bernstein said the organisation was ""outdated"" and needed reform.
""We have a massive problem in this country at the centre of English football. I'm talking about an outmoded structure which is not modern enough and not independent enough,"" he said.
Asked about his comments, Crouch replied: ""I share David's frustration. That's why we've made it clear that all sports governing bodies have to reform their governance codes.
""The FA is not excluded from that, and if they don't, they won't get public funding. It's as simple as that.""
A report from the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee in 2013 called for reforms in English football - and outlined concerns including financial management as well as the balance of power between the Premier League and the FA.
Crouch said there was good work being carried out by association executives but problems revolved around the FA Council, which has 124 elected members.
""If there's no move whatsoever, and at the moment we are seeing nothing from the FA in terms of progress, they are likely to lose some public money or it will go elsewhere in the delivery of football,"" she added.
The FA declined to comment, although a source stressed that it is a not-for-profit organisation with government funding ploughed into grassroots football.","The FA could lose millions of pounds of funding if it does not reform, says Sports Minister Tracey Crouch."
"Eleven of Scotland's 14 territorial health boards were hit by the ""ransomware"" attack linked to other IT attacks around the world.
The hack has encrypted information on NHS computers, denying access unless a payment is made.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said work to fix the systems affected had entered a ""recovery phase""
She called the attack ""hugely concerning"" but said there was no evidence as yet to suggest outdated computer systems were responsible for the breach.
Scotland's Health Secretary Shona Robison said there was a ""level of confidence"" that systems would be back up and running by Monday and that no breach of patient confidentiality had been detected.
The health boards which have been affected are:
The Scottish Ambulance Service has also been affected, along with NHS National Services Scotland.
The incidents are thought to be part of a wider attack affecting organisations in about 100 countries around the world.
IT problems have also caused disruption in about 30 health authorities in England, while the NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland are so far unaffected.
The Scottish government said most incidents had been confined to desktop computers in GP surgeries, dental practices and other primary care centres.
A spokesman said the only acute hospital sites so far affected had been in NHS Lanarkshire.
BBC Scotland understands that computer systems at Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride were compromised.
Ms Robison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that IT specialists had been working non-stop to get GP systems back up and running.
She said: ""People are working very, very hard and have worked through the night. The update I've got this morning is that we're very much into recovery phase now, with a lot of work going on to get systems back up running.
""The GP systems, which of course were the main problem across our health boards - work is going on, and there is a level of confidence that many will be back up and running before GP surgeries open on Monday morning.""
Ms Sturgeon told the BBC: ""Obviously cyber-attacks of this nature are hugely concerning and I think they underline the vulnerability not just of the public sector, but also of society generally to cyber-attacks, but they also underline the importance of all organisations making sure that they have all appropriate measures in place to protect against those kinds of attack.""
She added: ""Obviously there is a lot of investigation into exactly why the health service has been affected in the way it has. I think it's important to stress that this has been a global international attack.""
Shona Robison said NHS Lanarkshire had been more affected in terms of its acute hospitals, but said manual systems had worked safely and insisted that patients had not been negatively impacted by the breach.
""The intention today is to begin testing those IT systems and to gradually and safely try to bring those back on over the course of the weekend.""
Ms Robison added: ""Throughout all of this there's been no breach to patient confidentiality that has been detected to date so patients should be reassured by that.""
Patient services, including emergency services, are continuing to operate across Scotland, the Scottish government confirmed.
Ms Robison emphasised there had been no impact on the majority of the out-of-hours systems across Scotland, with NHS 24 working as normal along with the Scottish Ambulance Service, where the only issue had been with desktop PCs that were ""non-patient facing"".
""All the other parts of the system that people would use over the weekend are working as normal,"" Ms Robison said.
In NHS Lanarkshire, non-emergency patients have been urged to stay away from its hospitals as it deals with the ransomware attack.
Dr Helen Mackie, chief of medical services at Hairmyres Hospital, said staff had reverted to paper and manual records for patients.
She has urged any patients turning up at the authorities emergency departments to bring their medication with them because medics may have problems accessing their records.
She said: ""Help us by bringing as much information with you, So bring your medicines, bring any information you have about health care. Relatives can really help us as well because they're a wealth of information for us.""
Dr Mackie said the IT issues were leading to the cancellation of planned out-patient appoints for tests such as CT scans. However, she said that any emergency diagnostic tests would continue to take place.
She added: ""It's business as usual in terms of emergency care in our Lanarkshire hospitals. We are asking the public to help us by only coming to emergency departments if it is an emergency. But please be reassured that all our emergency access to treatment and care is up and fully running.""",The Scottish government says it is working closely with health officials following a global cyber hack.
"Supermarket worker David Sinclair, 34, shook his five-month-old son Joshua in a fit of anger, causing him to die at Hairmyres Hospital hours later.
At the High Court in Glasgow, Sinclair pleaded guilty to culpable homicide in regard to the infant's death on 6 December, 2012.
He is due to return to the court for sentencing next month.
Sinclair was originally charged with murder, but admitted the reduced charge of culpable homicide, just days before he was due to go on trial.
Prosecutor Ashley Edwards said that on the day the child died, Sinclair and his now wife Kirsty and Joshua went swimming and then shopping in East Kilbride.
At 17:30 Kirsty Sinclair went out to meet her mother and sister.
Just 11 minutes later she received a phone call from Sinclair, who sounded ""shocked"". He told her: ""Joshua isn't breathing properly, come home right away."" He then hung up and dialled 999.
The court heard that Kirsty Sinclair, who is pregnant, married Sinclair on the anniversary of their son's first birthday on 9 July 2013, and had said she was standing by him.
Initially the cause of Joshua's death was unascertained, but the case was reviewed by a team of medical experts who discovered evidence of trauma in the eyes and brain which could only have been caused non-accidentally close to the time of death.
One of the experts, Dr Peter Richards, consultant paediatric neuro-surgeon at John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, said: ""This would be compatible with him having suffered a shaking injury involving handling at greater force than encountered in everyday life.
""It would be compatible with a shaking event where a carer, who has not planned to injure a child, has a momentary loss of control with tragic consequences.""
Defending QC, Ian Duguid, told the court that Sinclair had found it ""unimaginable"" that the handling of his child would have resulted in such catastrophic injuries.
The  barrister added: ""He is extremely remorseful for the events which have ensued. Witnesses in double figures would have come forward to talk of his caring abilities as a parent.""
Det Ch Insp Laura McLuckie, who was the senior investigating officer in the case, said: ""David Sinclair admitted to being responsible for the death of his baby son, Joshua, who died needlessly at a young and vulnerable age.
""My sincere condolences go out to Joshua's extended family, who have endured this harrowing incident and continue to live with the pain of Joshua's untimely death.
""A defenceless baby died at the hands of his father, the one person whose role was to protect and care for him.""","A man has admitted killing his baby son in a ""harrowing incident"" at his home in East Kilbride."
"Kyle Sheehan was stabbed in the leg in Jiggins Lane, Bartley Green, at about 22:15 BST on 21 September.
A man, 23, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. Three people, aged 16, 18 and 29, arrested on suspicion of wounding have been released on bail.
Kyle had been in intensive care but died on Friday night, West Midlands Police said.
Det Ch Insp Wayne Jones: ""He leaves behind a family and many friends who are distraught and struggling to come to terms with what has happened.
""We know many people were in the area and would have seen what went on that night but many are still yet to come forward.
""We appeal to you to speak to us and help us find those people responsible for killing Kyle.""","A 16-year-old boy who was stabbed in Birmingham has died, prompting a murder investigation."
"Kim Eacott's terrier, Scally, had ""separation anxiety"" and would bark constantly at her Hereford cottage.
Angela Waring, of Crickhowell, Powys, was held jointly responsible by a judge in the noise nuisance complaint as she owned the home.
She has contested the decision at London's Appeal Court, which will make a ruling at a later date.
Mrs Waring paid for her daughter's cottage despite the pair having fallen out.
The court heard Scally barked incessantly when Miss Eacott was not at home in 2011 and 2012, prompting neighbours Bryn and Diane Cocking to file a claim the noise was ""unreasonable in its frequency and duration"".
Mrs Waring said she offered to take Scally to a ""dog whisperer"" to try to calm him down, despite not being on speaking terms with her daughter.
In Worcester County Court in 2013, judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins upheld the Cockings' noise nuisance claim.
Miss Eacott was ordered to pay £3,500 in damages and her mother £1,000. Both were hit with a £31,000 legal costs bill.
Mrs Waring has asked the court to rule that she was not responsible for her daughter, so should not have to pay for her failing to control Scally.
Hamish MacBean, for Mrs Waring, said she had done her best to defuse the row and wrote to her daughter, telling her: ""If Scally barks when you are not there, there is a dog whisperer in Abergavenny who can cure him in a gentle way.""
The court heard their relationship was so strained Mrs Waring had been advised by police not to talk to her daughter following a harassment complaint.
Catherine Doran, for the Cockings, said: ""Were it not for Mrs Waring's failure to abate the nuisance, Mr and Mrs Cocking would not have had to issue a claim at all.""
Lady Justice Arden argued Mrs Waring had ""turned a blind eye"" to the problem.
The court heard Scally has since been put down.
Appeal Court judges reserved their decision until an unspecified future date.","A woman is fighting a £30,000 legal bill after her daughter's yapping dog prompted legal action by neighbours."
"The pensioner was found dead at an address in Park Lane at about 22:30 BST last Wednesday, West Yorkshire Police said.

"The Cumbrians have lost their last four league games, including damaging defeats to fellow challengers Plymouth Argyle and Portsmouth.
And Saturday's loss to Cambridge saw them concede three goals without reply for the second home game in a row.
""There's a nervousness about the group,"" Curle told BBC Radio Cumbria.
""There's a nervousness about the supporters as well. They're desperate for us to and the players want to do well to get over the line and finish top three.""
Despite the downturn, Carlisle remain fifth in the League Two table, four points behind Portsmouth in the third automatic promotion place, and six points above eighth-placed Mansfield.
But the tough games continue with sixth-place Luton and Mansfield next for Curle's side.
""Teams won't come here and roll over,"" he added. ""So we need to go back to basics, scrap and fight for everything which means we need a level of aggression about us.

"A BBC investigation has uncovered the two men staging ""Botox parties"" in homes and beauty salons for people desperate to banish wrinkles.
While they were once registered nurses, both have been ordered to stop practising - making it illegal for them to prescribe medicine.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) is investigating the BBC's findings.
The appeal of Botox parties is that procedures costing upwards of Â£400 can be half the price - with the organiser often given a free treatment.
Updates on this and more stories from Herefordshire & Worcestershire
But clients of one man, Jonathan Henk, who calls himself ""Jonny Botox"", have claimed they were left in severe pain.
Mr Henk, 50, describes himself as a nurse of 26 years, but was struck off by the NMC in 2012 for having sex with a mental health patient without her consent.
He is now prescribing Botox to people for Â£200 a time - something that should only be done by registered practitioners.
An undercover reporter filmed him at a Botox party at a house in Wolverhampton, where he injected three women.
Mr Henk offered to give our reporter as much Botox as required.
Wearing gloves and taking the syringe from a flask, he prepared to inject her before she told him she had changed her mind.
Diane Roberts, 52, was a patient of Mr Henk's - but she says she was left with severe headaches after being injected with a substance that did not alter her appearance.
""It felt like someone had put an axe in the middle of my head. It was horrible,"" she said.
""I'm concerned as to what was being injected because I thought that Botox had an instant effect.""
Botulinum toxin is a prescription-only medicine meaning it is regulated by legislation.
It can only be prescribed by a doctor, dentist or nurse in a specific patient's name - and can only be used for that patient.
Once a prescription has been written, the Botox is purchased and dispensed from a pharmacy.
It is not illegal for an untrained person to inject Botox - but the Royal College of Surgeons said laws should be tightened to ensure only those with proper training administer it.
Health Education England has published two reports with guidelines on the qualifications individuals should have - but no new laws have yet been passed.
James Kearsey advertises his services via Facebook on the page Estetica Cosmetics, and also describes himself as a nurse.
But in November 2015 he was suspended by the NMC after hiding a conviction for assault from his bosses at Russells Hall Hospital, Dudley.
Mr Kearsey agreed to a consultation at his home in Stourbridge, where he told our reporter he was a nurse consultant - ""the same level as a doctor"" - and that he makes thousands of pounds training others.
He sterilised her forehead and prepared to inject her before she told him she felt sick and left.
When later approached by our reporter as he attended a clinic in Blackpool, Mr Kearsey said ""no comment"" and ran away.
Mr Henk, of Bromsgrove, admitted he knew what he was doing was wrong.
""It's actually almost like doing a brain operation without a licence, so it is actually quite a serious offence,"" he said.
He denied knowledge of patients having bad side effects and said it was very rare that anyone was unhappy with his work.
""It is very rare that people get bruises. You get the odd one or two.
""Everyone said they were really happy. It's quite upsetting to hear that people aren't happy.
""I am looking at stopping and I am looking for other jobs. It's just very difficult because you've got bills to pay.""
Despite breaking the law by prescribing the medicine, the legislation around cosmetic procedures continues to be a grey area.
NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh led a review into cosmetic surgery and non-surgical beauty treatments in 2013 in the wake of the PIP breast implant scandal.
And while the government promised new rules meaning treatments would no longer be allowed to be administered by untrained workers, legislation has not yet been passed.
The NMC said it would investigate Mr Kearsey, adding: ""As he is currently temporarily suspended from the register he should not be undertaking any activity that would be done by a registered nurse, including prescribing medicines.""
A spokeswoman added: ""In relation to Mr Henk who has been struck off the register, he should not be claiming to be a registered nurse or undertaking any activity that would require him to be on the professional register, including prescribing medicines; to do so is a criminal offence.""
Mandy Luckman is a clinical negligence lawyer for Irwin Mitchell who specialises in cosmetic surgery. ""The legislation around Botox is non-existent. And yet the industry is huge,"" she said.
""There have been many injuries reported. The government needs to take it seriously.""
A spokesman for the Department of Health said: ""In adopting the recommendations of the Keogh Review, we are working to improve the safety of cosmetic interventions through better training and robust qualifications for practitioners.""

It ends a long wait for success, with Great Britain's 3-0 victory over the Kiwis in 2007 their last triumph against either New Zealand or world champions Australia.
England took an 8-0 lead with Gareth Widdop's penalty followed by a converted Elliott Whitehead try.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Jason Nightingale superbly touched down in the corner before the break and the match became increasingly tense after the restart.
The Kiwis, trailing 8-6, looked to be wrestling the ascendancy but NRL-bound Whitehead burst through to score.
And there was a huge cheer from the sold-out Wigan crowd when the video referee awarded a try after skipper Sean O'Loughlin touched down under the sticks late on.
Even then, the Kiwis kept coming as Roger Tuivasa-Sheck and Jordan Kahu scored to make it 20-14 and leave England desperately hanging on, desperate to close out the game, in the final minute.
The match was England coach Steve McNamara's last before his contract expired - and he may well find himself with a new deal now his team have finally won a series.
Going into the contest, his side had a record of just two victories from 11 matches against Australia and New Zealand.
McNamara is still waiting for his first win against the Kangaroos but after near misses in the 2013 World Cup and 2014 Four Nations, the significance of Saturday's win cannot be overstated.
McNamara has established a base for his team in Burton and maintained all along that they are building and progressing - and now he has something to show for it.
An England team with class in all areas, and players such as Sam Burgess, George Burgess and Sam Tomkins absent from the current squad, can look forward to the 2016 Four Nations in England and Scotland with great confidence.
McNamara made two changes to his starting XIII for this game, and as former GB coach Brian Noble acknowledged: ""You've got to hand it to Steve for those.""
Huddersfield winger Jermaine McGillvary, the top try scorer in Super League last season, was a menace to the Kiwis with his powerful and aggressive kick returns. He also made a brilliant tackle under extreme pressure from Nightingale at a point when the match was in the balance.
Even more significant was the presence of Wigan half-back Matty Smith, who brought a measure of control and menace with his smart kicking game.
Not only did he help manoeuvre his team around the park, it was his smart grubber that allowed Whitehead to touch down for his team's opening try.
Questions were asked about the atmosphere at the previous two Test matches in Hull and London, but there could be no complaints in Wigan.
Sold out weeks ago, the knowledgeable crowd fully embraced what former former GB captain Jamie Peacock described as a ""blood and thunder"" match.
Spray flew off the players during collisions on a greasy surface and the crowd roared on every England attack, with the noise ratcheting up even further when Whitehead scored the game's decisive try after a lengthy pointless period in the second half.
And yet they also acknowledged brilliance from the opposition, applauding when watching a replay of Nightingale's brilliant athletic leap to avoid Zak Hardaker and touch down in the corner shortly before the break.
Of course, the teams were playing to the converted in Wigan and it does not change the fact the chance to win over some new fans was lost during the poor game at the Olympic Stadium last weekend.
Good question. McNamara is out of contract and the issue of his future needs to be resolved. England and Scotland will co-host the 2016 Four Nations at the back end of next year, which will also see Australia and the Kiwis compete. The fixtures for that tournament have yet to be announced.
England: Z Hardaker (Leeds); J McGillvary (Huddersfield), K Watkins (Leeds), J Bateman (Wigan), R Hall (Leeds); G Widdop (St George Illawarra), M Smith (Wigan); J Graham (Canterbury Bulldogs), J Hodgson (Canberra), C Hill (Warrington), E Whitehead (Catalans Dragons), L Farrell (Wigan), S O'Loughlin (Wigan, capt).

"Pompey climbed into the top three for the first time since September with a 2-0 win at Crawley on Tuesday.
""We've had so much criticism,"" Cook told BBC Radio Solent. ""Some of it is not fair and we all feel it after a bad result or performance.
""That's the way to answer it, with that kind of result.""
After disappointing home results against Morecambe and Crewe, Portsmouth moved above Carlisle into third with the win at Crawley.
Second-half goals from Christian Burgess and Kyle Bennett gave Portsmouth all three points.
With 11 games remaining in the season, Cook knows his squad need to keep their focus in the run-in.

"The sustainable development white paper was launched at a school in Blaenavon, Torfaen, dubbed a good example for helping the wider community.
However, the Conservatives said urgent action was needed amid growing environmental concerns.
And Welsh language campaigners feared their cause could fall lower down the priorities of public bodies.
Delegates from organisations including local councils were told that Blaenavon Heritage Primary School was chosen as the location for the launch as it provided a wide range of courses and services across the area for residents with a number of public bodies working together.
""Our approach is very much rooted in Welsh values, with a focus on fairness, pride in our communities and our heritage,"" said John Griffiths, environment and sustainable development minister.
""The proposals set out in this White Paper are about focusing on the social, economic and environmental well being for Welsh people and Welsh communities over the long term.""
The Sustainable Development Bill includes:
For the Conservatives, shadow environment minister Russell George said: ""While this consultation and its influence on future policy is extremely important, we have long called for Labour ministers to get a grip on sustainable development.
""With greenhouse gases on the rise, mobility policy failing, health inequalities getting wider and wildlife habitats in decline, it's more important than ever that we see urgent improvements.""
Meanwhile, the Welsh Language Society (Cymdeithas yr Iaith Gymraeg) has concerns.
Sustainable communities spokesperson Toni Schiavone said: ""The government's language strategy is completely clear that Welsh needs to be mainstreamed in all its departments, especially where the work affects the future of Welsh speaking communities.
""However, under this Bill, there is a risk that public bodies will downgrade the Welsh language as a policy consideration.
""The government intends to make sustainable development public bodies' central organising principle.
""In that context, it's essential that the welfare of the Welsh language is part of the definition of sustainable development.""
The consultation runs until March with a number of public events from January.","The Welsh government wants to introduce a new law to protect the ""well-being"" of community life."
"The Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPW) said the move could offer training opportunities for teachers and give children more free time.
But concerns include childcare access and transport availability.
The Welsh Government said it was ""not proposing a national policy for a four-and-a-half day school week"" but was considering the report's findings.
The report, commissioned by former Education Minister Huw Lewis, said while there was some anecdotal information about the potential advantages and disadvantages there was very little research on the impact.
Those in favour of the system suggest the shorter fifth day would allow for more free time for pupils, which they could spend with family and friends, on after-school activities or attend appointments without missing lessons.
Advocates also suggest it could improve staff well-being and free-up teachers for more training time.
But the report also said school staff with children attending schools which do not use the system might have issues with childcare, and that longer days could make pupils more tired.
Cerian Rolls, a mother-of-three and a part-time teacher from Aberdare, Rhondda Cynon Taff, told BBC Radio Wales she was not convinced as a working parent by the arguments for longer school days.
""To make the day potentially longer at both ends could put a strain on those working parents who are struggling like myself to get childcare,"" she told the Good Morning Wales programme.
Ms Rolls added that many parents would be sorry if longer school days meant children had less opportunity to enjoy after-school activities.
NUT Wales policy officer Owen Hathway told the programme he would be ""wary"" of such changes, and felt there was not yet enough evidence from other countries to show that they worked.
""There's an issue on those longer days that children might become fatigued,"" he said.
""As you come to the end of those longer afternoons you're not getting as productive a lesson as you could potentially have.""
Some schools in Scotland have already adopted an asymmetric school week in response to an anticipated budget cuts, with an earlier finish on Friday.
The report said the move had resulted in the more effective use of teachers' time and a better use of resources, which would help schools respond to further budget cuts if they come.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are not proposing a national policy for a four-and-a-half day school week in Wales.
""The PPIW have been asked to explore how evidence and research can support us to improve policy and practice in Wales and find new and innovative ways of doing so.
""They have presented us with a range of ideas and we should consider them all in detail, as we continue to focus on ways to raise standards in our schools and aspirations for all our pupils and young people.""
Plaid Cymru's Shadow Education Secretary Llyr Gruffydd also said that experience in Scotland showed the four-and-a-half day week ""can be made to work, creating space in the school timetable for pupils to broaden their extra-curricular experiences and for professional development opportunities for staff"".
He added that Plaid would also look at the structure of the school year, saying: ""Teachers tell us that introducing shorter terms and more frequent holidays would lead to improved educational outcomes for children.""
Darren Millar, education spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives, was against changing school hours.
""Squeezing the school week into four longer school days would create huge challenges in terms of childcare; cause chaos and congestion by adding to peak time traffic; and hinder learning capacity, particularly for younger pupils, as children tire towards the end of the school day,"" he said.
""Instead of using taxpayers' money to commission reports on changing the school week, the Welsh Government would do better to commission some work on the attainment gap between Wales and other nations in the UK.""","Changing the school week to four longer days and a half day could save money, a report has said."

A long-serving LU train driver, who wished to remain anonymous, told BBC News, ""We get paid an amazing salary and the holidays are great too [43 days leave including eight bank holidays] but why should I be forced to work nights and more weekends when that is not what I signed up for? It's about the principle of changing our working conditions without discussions.
""I hate striking but I will continue to do so until the company listens or they make it illegal to strike.

Steve Davison tweeted: ""#tubestrike genius - just saw some guys flag down a London open top tour bus to get to work. Crazy line at bus stop versus an open top ride.""
The strike has also affected businesses across the capital in a variety of ways.
David Leam, director of infrastructure at London First, which aims to promote businesses, said people had generally been better prepared for the disruption compared to July's strike.
He said: ""I think the last Tube strike was a bit of a shock... but people have learned from the experience so some have worked remotely or have adapted their journey.
""The businesses losing out more are probably those in hospitality. All the messaging last night was about making your journey early and getting home by 1830. Certainly it was quiet for some pubs and bars and restaurants although it's not a ghost town and there are still lots of tourists around.""
The strike, which follows a 24-hour stoppage on 8-9 July, saw Tube staff leave work between 18:30 and 21:30 BST on Wednesday.
Members of Aslef, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT), Unite and the Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) are all involved in the dispute.
Many union members will be standing on picket lines throughout the duration of the strike, which is over concerns new rotas to accommodate the night service will mean greater weekend working.
London Underground (LU) has apologised for the disruption, saying the latest offer - a 2% salary increase this year, an extra £200 per night shift for drivers for a limited time, and a £500 bonus for Night Tube staff - was aimed at improving work-life balance.
Mayor Boris Johnson called the latest offer ""incredibly generous"", and said he would not authorise any more money or negotiate while unions were ""holding a gun to Londoners' heads"".
He said: ""The way forward is to get this excellent deal to their membership. They should call off this stupid strike and put the deal to their members.
""No driver is being asked to work more hours than they do today. ""
But Mick Whelan, the General Secretary of Aslef said: ""The Tube driver works intensively in very awkward conditions. It affects their health, work-life balance and they don't have the best of lives.""
He said the competency and skill levels required by Tube drivers exceeded that of bus drivers and as such staff needed to be compensated.
""We are not against the Night Tube if it's run in a reasonable and adequate manner... but I don't believe it can be delivered [by 12 September],"" he said.
A striking Tube driver, who later admitted he was an RMT representative, phoned BBC London 94.9 to say he had seen the new rosters and they showed LU would be ""spreading staff much more thinly"" to maintain the Night Tube.
He said: ""As well as being made to work more nights and weekends they're also being displaced and told to work 30 minutes up the line and that their duties can be changed at 24 hours' notice. But of course there's been no mention of that.""
Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, told the BBC: ""The Night Tube... cannot be at any cost. They're clearly not understanding our commitment to work life-balance.
""We've recruited 500 additional staff specifically to run the Night Tube and that's across stations and train operators.
""No-one's being asked to work extra hours... we've also committed that our train operators will have the same number of weekends off today as when they do Night Tube.""
One official from the RMT also told BBC London that members would ""escalate action"" in the run-up to the scheduled start of the night service.

"At least 10 more women were wounded, medical sources said.
A Houthi rebel spokesman said the strike was followed by a second which hit emergency responders in Arhab, 40km (25 miles) from Sanaa.
The rebels blamed a US and Saudi-backed coalition for the bloodshed, who are yet to comment.
The coalition has been fighting the Houthis and forces loyal to a former Yemeni president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, since March 2015.
Its aim is to restore the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.
Abdel-Rahman al-Ahnomi, a spokesman for the Houthis, said the twin strikes killed and wounded dozens of people.
However, other reports from the scene said there was only one air strike. Conflicting reports are common in the chaos following air raids in Yemen.
Yemen's war has killed more than 10,000 civilians and displaced more than three million people since 2015.
The conflict and a blockade imposed by the Saudi-led coalition have also triggered a humanitarian disaster, leaving 80% of the population in need of aid.
Doctors Without Borders warned this week of a worsening situation in the city of Taiz, where hospitals have been repeatedly attacked and where 200,000 people face food, water and medicine shortages.
The US was criticised last month over a raid on a village in central Yemen, in which a number of civilians died - many of them children. Its target was the house of a suspected leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

"Sunni Muslim, Tanveer Ahmed, 32, from Bradford in Yorkshire, stabbed 40-year-old Asad Shah outside his store in Glasgow's Shawlands area on 24 March.
Mr Shah was an Ahmadi - a minority sect not recognised by all Muslims.
Ahmed admitted the murder and said the victim had disrespected Islam by falsely claiming to be a prophet.
Why was Asad Shah murdered?
In July, Ahmed pleaded guilty to the religiously-motivated murder at a hearing at the High Court in Glasgow.
Last month, he was given a mandatory life term and told he must serve a minimum of 27 years before he can apply for parole.
Jailing him, judge Lady Rae told Ahmed: ""This was a barbaric, premeditated and wholly unjustified killing of a much-loved man who was a pillar of the local community.
""He was described as a peaceful and peace-loving man and family man who went out of his way to show respect for those of any faith.""
The judge branded the attack as ""an appalling display of merciless violence"".
It has now emerged that lawyers for Ahmed have lodged an appeal against his sentence.
The court previously heard that Mr Shah was an Ahmadi,  who differ from the majority of Muslims, including Sunni Muslims, in that they believe the Prophet Muhammad was not the final prophet.
The majority of Muslims believe Muhammad was the final prophet and say any other view is inconsistent with Islamic belief.
Ahmed, a Sunni, claimed that he had killed Mr Shah because he had posted videos online in which the shopkeeper had ""disrespected"" Islam by claiming to be a prophet.
Ahmed watched a clip featuring Mr Shah on his mobile phone as he travelled to Glasgow on the day of the murder and was heard in a phone message to say ""listen to this guy, something needs to be done, it needs nipped in the bud"".
When he arrived at the shop, Ahmed said he warned Mr Shah that he was there to kill him and asked him to stop claiming to be a prophet.
CCTV footage of the attack showed Ahmed pulling a knife out and moving behind the counter and stabbing Mr Shah repeatedly.
The shopkeeper managed to get outside, but was stabbed again and then stamped on and kicked in a frenzied attack as he lay dying in the street.
Mr Shah's brother Athar Shah tried to intervene, but was unable to fend off Ahmed.
As Mr Shah lay dying on the ground, Ahmed walked calmly to a bus shelter where police found him a short time later.
After being arrested, Ahmed released a statement through his lawyer saying he had killed Mr Shah as he had falsely claimed to be a prophet.","A man who was jailed for life for murdering a shopkeeper who he claimed had ""disrespected"" Islam is to appeal against his minimum 27-year jail term."

"But most of the Somerset batsmen failed to exploit good batting conditions, Keith Barker and Chris Woakes both picking up three wickets, backed by two from Jonathan Trott,
After rallying from 117-4 in a stand of 110 with Peter Trego, Abell made 104.
Despite Trego's 94, Somerset missed a third batting point but did take two wickets as the Bears closed on 27-2.
Having proved generally below par with the bat on a lovely early summer's day at Edgbaston, the visitors then came out firing with the ball in a lively seven-over session.
First they had former Bears skipper Ian Westwood lbw to Lewis Gregory before nightwatchman Boyd Rankin was brilliantly caught off Craig Overton at leg gully by James Hildreth, who had earlier been the only other worthwhile Somerset contributor with 38.
After Barker knocked back Marcus Trescothick's off stump and Chris Rogers was caught behind fourth ball inside the first hour, eight batsmen failed to reach 15.
An attack which persevered to keep the pressure on all day, was boosted by Trott taking 2-26 in 10 overs.
Warwickshire captain Ian Bell, who left the field in mid-afternoon with a hamstring twinge, is expected to be fine to bat on day two.
Warwickshire batsman Jonathan Trott told BBC WM:
""They've not got a huge score but it's a decent score on this wicket. There's a bit in it for the bowlers. We've got to fight to get on top. We're going to have to bat well.
""It's been a while since my last Championship wicket, so I was as surprised as everyone else in the crowd. We just needed someone to do a job from that end - the wind was tricky because we've got a lot of bowlers who like to swing the ball away, so I said I'd bowl gun-barrel straight for a bit. A little bit of seam movement helped too. It's always nice to help.
""Tom Abell looks a very talented young player. He's a good all-round sportsman. I've heard he's a good hockey player as well. You can certainly see that in his game. He looks an organised player. He's certainly one for the future, for Somerset and beyond hopefully.
Somerset batsman Tom Abell:
""I probably haven't been pulling my weight so far this year if I'm brutally honest, so it was really pleasing to score a few runs. I don't want to be relying on the likes of Tres and Hildy and Chris Rogers at the top of the order.
""It was a real challenge against Barker and Woakes with the new ball. I was just looking to stick in and try and weather the storm.
""It was a big relief for me after the start I've had.

"Using pictures from the Cassini probe, the researchers have detected and tracked a slight wobble in the moon.
After seven years of study, they have concluded this flutter would be much less if the icy crust was connected directly to Enceladus's rock core.
It is strong support for the idea of an intervening, global mass of liquid.
""If the surface and core were rigidly connected, the core would provide so much dead weight that the wobble would be far smaller than we observe it to be,"" said Matthew Tiscareno, a Cassini scientist based at the Seti Institute but previously affiliated to Cornell University, US.
""This proves that there must be a global layer of liquid separating the surface from the core.""
Activity on Enceladus has been one of the great discoveries on the Cassini mission, which arrived at Saturn in 2004.
The first clue that something interesting was going on was some low-resolution images showing a plume coming off the south pole that had the space-interested internet all abuzz.
Shortly after, Cassini detected a disturbance in magnetic fields produced by the presence of what appeared to be an atmosphere.
Scientists then established that the moon was actually venting huge jets of water vapour through south polar surface cracks dubbed tiger stripes because of their resemblance to the big cat's fur coat.
Models were subsequently produced to explain how liquid water could be maintained on a 500km-wide body in the outer Solar System, and how that water might be feeding the jets.
But there has always been a debate about how large the hidden reservoir might be. Early thinking suggested it might only be a relatively small lens of water.
This new result, published in the journal Icarus, is the best evidence yet that the sub-surface sea is not regional in nature, but encircles the entire globe.
It is significant because it makes it more possible that Enceladus is a habitable world.  In those jets, Cassini has also detected salts and organic molecules.  The chemistry has scientists intrigued, and fired up to send a dedicated mission to the moon.
When that might happen is unclear.  Both the US and European space agencies are only planning currently to send probes to Jupiter, and even they are not likely to get to their destination until the 2030s.
Cassini itself is winding up its observations in the Saturn system.  It has another couple of close passes of Enceladus this year before it then starts to manoeuvre towards disposal in the ringed planet's atmosphere in 2017.

But when you have the director of the biggest film of the year - and maybe of all time - asking you to play a part in his movie, that is as good a sign as any.
Such was the case for three Indonesian actors who millions of people will see in Star Wars: The Force Awakens this weekend.
All three - Yayan Ruhian, Iko Uwais and Cecep Arif Rahman - starred in the widely-praised 2012 Indonesian action film The Raid, or its 2014 sequel.
And it was thanks to Star Wars director JJ Abrams' enthusiasm for the films that they got the call to take part. It was only in the past week that their appearances - as intergalactic smugglers - were confirmed.
(No major spoilers ahead!)
""I was just a fan. It was an opportunity,"" Abrams told the website Slashfilm. ""I knew we needed people for this one sequence that would be particularly fun to see a group of people working together.
""I thought 'God, I wonder if the dudes from The Raid would be available?' And to my amazement, and they were willing, and they were incredible. They showed up and did a terrific job.""
Their roles are not as substantial as Harrison Ford's, or the robot C3PO's for that matter, but they play important enough a part to justify having Lego figures made in their image.
Being on the Star Wars set presented challenges to the actors, said Rahman, who is also credited as a stunt choreographer.
""Our filming schedule fell during the month of Ramadan and the three of us were fasting,"" he told the Jakarta Globe newspaper.
""It was one of the toughest fasting months for me, because we couldn't eat and drink for almost 19 hours. But the crew always made sure to prepare food for us to break the fast and to make sure we got some time to rest.""
Their casting has proven popular with fans in Indonesia. One wrote on Twitter: ""Caucasian characters work for Star Wars, but we're proud to have you guys in there!""
Another Indonesian actor from The Raid 2, Joe Taslim, starred in the 2013 film Fast and Furious 6, and will appear in the next instalment of the Star Trek series next year.
The Raid films, directed by Welshman Gareth Evans, follow Uwais' character Rama, a Jakarta policeman, as he battles against the city's underworld.
The films were released to critical acclaim, with the first winning the audience award at the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival.
The Force Awakens opened across Indonesia on Friday, but Uwais, for one, might find it difficult to catch the reaction, as he is filming deep in the Indonesian jungle, and was unavailable for interview.
As for whether they will appear in the many Star Wars sequels and spin-offs to come, Ruhian told the Coconuts Jakarta website he had to stay quiet thanks to a non-disclosure agreement.
""One can only hope,"" he said. ""For the last one, we had to be quiet about it for two years, let alone the next one.""","As a film actor, there might be a few signs that you have made it into the big time."

"When he talks about the Steamship Tahoe, he calls it simply The Queen.
The Queen sailed across Lake Tahoe, a breathtaking lake that straddles the border between California and Nevada, and is nestled high up in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. There are few places on earth as beautiful.
The steamer carried people, cargo and mail, and its passengers loved the ship's elegance, beauty and comfort.
But nothing can stop the march of technology, and so once a road around the lake was built in the 1930s, demand for the SS Tahoe all but disappeared. The company that owned it lost its contract to deliver the mail, and the once-proud ship fell into a sorry state of disrepair.
In came William Seth Bliss - the son of Duane Leroy Bliss, a local business tycoon - with a bright idea. He would intentionally scuttle the ship, sinking it into the lake at a depth that meant glass-bottomed boats could sail over it and get a great view. He hoped it would become a tourist attraction.
However, Bliss miscalculated. When SS Tahoe hit the bed of Lake Tahoe on a fateful day in 1940, it slipped down a slope - and kept going.
When it finally rested, it was 150m (490ft) underwater. Due to the lake's high altitude - almost 2,000m above sea level - diving to that depth is incredibly difficult. A team managed it in 2002, breaking a world record for high-altitude diving in the process.
And that's why I found myself on the banks of Lake Tahoe with the team from OpenROV.
OpenROV began, like many great ideas, as a crowdfunded Kickstarter project. Its aim was to create what is essentially an underwater drone capable of plunging into water and filming whatever it can see.
Its task today was to reach the depths of Lake Tahoe and get up close to the SS Tahoe for an extended tour of the ship the likes of which nobody had enjoyed for more than 70 years.
They used a drone that costs $899 (Â£685). It's dramatically cheaper than anything else capable of such a voyage, and the team hopes its work will see thousands of explorers take to the water to look closely at places that may be right under our noses but are so rarely seen.
Later this year, a $1,499 model, named Trident, will go on sale. It will be able to plunge to depths of 100m and travel at the speed of an Olympic swimmer.
As the SS Tahoe lies deeper than 100m, the team made several modifications for this one-off job. They dropped a long tether into the water to enable the drone to be controlled remotely at such depths. A team in a rubber dinghy on the surface transmitted data to mission control in a summerhouse commandeered by the team.
From here, using a PlayStation controller, the drone was navigated down to the ship. Watching online were some of OpenROV's community of enthusiasts - some of whom backed the original Kickstarter to get the project off the ground (or rather, underwater).
The drone went down, and down, until there it was: rusted, tangled, but unmistakably the ship we had been searching for.
The SS Tahoe is still upright, and the drone was able to swim on to its deck, peering into the cabins that given the environment were remarkably well preserved. The ship's dramatic slide into darkness had not ruined what made it so popular all those years ago.
The ship's stack had buckled in the middle but was still unmistakable. The drone was even able to glance through the ship's portholes.
The team cheered, the online audience typed their approval, and Mr Foster simply whispered: ""She's beautiful.""
It was one of several trips the team made into the lake that week, but the dream of OpenROV, co-founder David Lang says, was to democratise underwater exploration: ""Our ultimate goal is to inspire curiosity.""

"Walter Powley suffered serious burns following a fall at the Western Park View home in Hinckley Road, Leicester, in May 2012.
An investigation into his death found the radiator pipes and valves at the home were not covered.
It also found the owner was aware that Mr Powley was at risk of falls.
During a hearing at Leicester Crown Court, Western Park Leicester, based in Queen Street, Wolverhampton, pleaded guilty to safety breaches.
The firm was also ordered to pay £35,000 in costs.
In a statement, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said Mr Powley had been admitted to the home four days before being injured.
It said he fell in his room and suffered serious burns to his right leg from the radiator pipe and valves, and superficial burns to both legs.
He died in hospital eight days later.

"While opinion is divided, Mrs Clinton is largely thought to have come out on top in Sunday's debate in St Louis. But columnists raised the issue of her failure to tackle Mr Trump effectively, allowing him to ""exceed expectations"".
""The smiling Hillary we saw throughout the first debate on Long Island? She didn't make the trip west.""
Fox News concludes that Mr Trump managed to pull off a surprising performance, although the news channel does not explicitly state that the Republican candidate won the debate.
The conservative network says he performed well, pivoting and manoeuvring through questions, allowing him to save his presidential hopes.
Political analyst William Whelan said the night fell into the hands of Mr Trump.
He said the Republican defended his record and unlike the first debate, when he was often blown off course by the former secretary of state and ""torpedoed by his own badgering performance"", he improved as the night went on.
Mr Trump's decision to launch a blistering attack against Hillary Clinton and her husband is described by Fox as the equivalent of ""Hillary dropping Alicia Machado on Trump"" in the previous debate.
That was the line used by Breitbart news, which is in a minority in handing the title to Mr Trump.
In a leading story quoting comments from former mayor of New York City, Rudy Giuliani, it reports that Mrs Clinton was ""pounded on bad decisions"".
It refers to accusations from Mr Trump that Mrs Clinton and the Democratic Party helped ""create the vacuum in the Middle East"" that allowed so-called Islamic State to form.
The hard-right news website, whose executive chairman Stephen Bannon was appointed Mr Trump's campaign chief in August, is running its own readers' poll, the results of which have yet to be announced.
The site also highlights support from Republican vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence, who said in a tweet that he was proud of Mr Trump and congratulated him on ""a big debate win"", while ending it with a shortened form of Mr Trump's 'Make America Great Again' slogan.
""All Hillary Clinton had to do was remain upright for 90 minutes.""
The Washington Post's verdict is that the debate highlighted an ""increasingly isolated"" Mr Trump during an ""unusually dark and bitter face-off"". Over the past year, the newspaper has been at the forefront of investigations into Mr Trump, and has published several editorials condemning the candidate.
On the news site's Right Turn blog, Jennifer Rubin says Mrs Clinton had very little to do in order to go ""the last little way in wrapping up the election"".
She writes that Mrs Clinton handled the audience well when answering questions, adding that the former secretary of state effectively won the debate early on by ""simply keeping her cool"".
Issues ranging from Mr Trump's tax payments to his foreign policy have, according to the Post, given Mrs Clinton plenty of material for a new raft of political ads.
In a separate piece for the Post, opinion writer Eugene Joseph Dionne Jr writes that Mr Trump's ""petulant"" and ""boorish"" approach on the night was an indication of ""a man aware that his campaign was at the edge of extinction"".
""It took the nastiest, most bitterly personal presidential debate in recent memory for the Republican nominee to stanch the downward plunge"" - so writes Stephen Collinson for CNN.
He says that Mr Trump will live to fight another day ""after throwing out a battery of vicious counter punches"", while US politics ""changed in the course of one nasty night"".
Meanwhile a CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers handed Sunday's victory to Mrs Clinton. But the results also showed that Mr Trump managed to exceed expectations.
Mrs Clinton took the win with 57% of the vote, the poll says, while Mr Trump managed to achieve 34%. The result could be considered a disappointment for Mrs Clinton, who scored 62% in the first presidential debate.
The Atlantic, which endorsed Mrs Clinton last week, suggests that Mr Trump suffered an ""implosion"" in St Louis on Sunday.
Ron Fournier, whose coverage of US politics dates back to the days of Bill Clinton, writes that Mrs Clinton did about as well as anyone could while dealing with a ""barking"" opponent and ""pouting menace"".
Mr Fournier said that throughout the debate the controversial Republican ""failed to patch together his collapsing campaign"".
The website suggests that Mrs Clinton perfectly handled Mr Trump's comment about ""instructing my attorney general to get a special prosecutor"" to look into allegations that she deleted thousands of emails in violation of a congressional subpoena.
Mrs Clinton laughed and said it was a good thing ""somebody with Donald Trump's temperament"" doesn't have such power.
""Nothing hurts a bully like somebody laughing at him,"" the column says.",The US media have given their verdict on who won the second presidential debate after Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton engaged in attack and counter-attack.

"The team, founded by five-time Olympic champion Sir Bradley Wiggins to develop young British talent, was omitted from the race which runs from 28-30 April.
""It's very disappointing and it is very much a surprise,"" said the team's sports director Simon Cope.
Race organisers said the event was oversubscribed and ""unfortunately someone had to miss out"".
A total of 49 teams applied for 36 slots - 18 in the men's race and 18 in the women's.
The decision on who was included was made between Welcome to Yorkshire and cycling event organisers ASO, who jointly run the event.
A Welcome to Yorkshire spokesman said that Team Wiggins were welcome to apply for any future editions of the race.
But Cope told Cycling Weekly that he believed the team, who are the only British third-tier UCI Continental outfit not included, could have made an impact in the race.
""Good or bad press at the moment, there's a percentage of the UK population who will be going to the race who want to see (Team) Wiggins there,"" he said.
""You would have thought that we would have got in, but the organisers have made their selection and that's it, we can't do anything about it. We will have to go and find another bike race to do.""
An investigation by UK Anti-Doping is currently ongoing into allegations of wrongdoing in cycling involving Wiggins - who retired in December - and Team Sky.
Cope, who used to work for Team Sky, was questioned by MPs earlier this month about the contents of a medical package he delivered to Wiggins when he was racing at the 2011 Criterium du Dauphine in France.
Team Sky have admitted ""mistakes were made"" around how medical records relating to the package were kept but deny breaking anti-doping rules.","Team Wiggins say they are ""surprised"" and ""disappointed"" after being excluded from next month's Tour de Yorkshire."

"Third seed Murray beat Czech eighth seed Tomas Berdych 6-4 6-4 to reach the final for a fourth time.
The 27-year-old Scot, who reached 500 career wins this week, won the title in 2009 and 2013.
Defending champion Djokovic overcame USA's John Isner 7-6 (7-3) 6-2 to set up a meeting with Murray, whom he beat in Indian Wells last week.
Murray's convincing victory, in which he broke Berdych's serve four times, took his career record against him to 6-6.
""I did most things well; there's not a lot I could complain about,"" said Murray.
""My second serve was much better in the second set. I served well on the big points and got a lot of free points behind my serve.
""I've played well this week, much better than I did at Indian Wells.""
The match was a repeat of the Australian Open clash in January, which Murray won in four tense sets as he went up against Berdych and former coach Dani Vallverdu.
There was another familiar face in the Berdych box in Miami after fitness coach Jez Green recently began working with the Czech, having left Murray's team along with Vallverdu last November.
In contrast to Melbourne, Murray made the sharper start on Saturday, breaking the Berdych serve either side of dropping his own.
Berdych looked unsettled, complaining about the balls and a line call as Murray saw out the set by making an impressive 77% of first serves.
A confident Murray broke to love early in the second set, but two double faults gave the advantage straight back.
Both men were stepping in and attacking returns at every opportunity, and Murray's strength in that area proved the difference when he broke Berdych for a fourth time.
He almost clinched victory with a fifth break and had to recover from 0-30 to serve it out.
Although the first set against Isner went to a tie-break, Djokovic never faced a break point as he won in an hour and a half.
""I played a terrific match,"" said Djokovic, who has won the Miami title four times.
""The opening set was pretty close. His resistance wilted a bit in the second set.

"The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower.
Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda.
There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments.
The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa.
Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled.
The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals.
Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda.
According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010.
After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989
But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia.","Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years."

The report said the lookout might have pushed the wrong switch on the electronic system to warn colleagues, might have forgotten to send a warning or their ""vigilance had degraded"" because it was near the end of the recommended two-hour shift for a lookout.","Nine railway workers were within seconds of being hit by a train travelling at 98mph, a safety investigation has found."
"But in a BBC interview, Williams cast doubt on whether the 40-year-old can win another major and suggested Woods' fitness problems might have been self-inflicted.
No-one knows Woods' game better than Williams, who shared in 13 of the American's 14 major titles among 84 tournament victories together.
Their partnership broke down in 2011 and Woods has since not added to his major tally. The former world number one last played competitively in August last year.
Woods has slumped to 467 in the world rankings while he recovers from his latest back surgery and there seems no prospect of an imminent return.
Yet Williams is convinced the golfer can achieve more professional victories.
""I don't doubt he will come back to the winner's circle,"" Williams told 5 live Golf.
""He is a great competitor, he has an incredible work ethic - when he can work hard - and one thing he does know how to do is win.
""He has that ability to win even when he's not playing his best. But whether he comes back and wins major championships? That's going to be a very difficult task.""
The four-times Masters champion looks certain to miss next month's Augusta gathering for only the second time since his debut as an amateur in 1995.
Williams was Woods' right-hand man throughout the period between 1999 and 2008 when the American dominated the game, and Williams thinks his old employer may now be regretting the way he punished his body during that spell.
""I guess when he looks back, he might question some of the activities that he did, some of the gym work that he might have done that, you know, had all these injuries escalate,"" he said.
Watching from a much greater distance, it seemed to me that Woods trained as an athlete rather than as a golfer. Athletes' bodies usually break down in their late 30s, certainly in terms of enabling competition at the highest level.
Is this what has happened? Does Williams see any worth to this argument?
""It is very hard to pinpoint how he has got to where he is now, but I'd have to say there is a lot merit in what you've just said,"" he said.
Williams was caddying for US veteran Ray Floyd in the mid-1990s when he first came across the willowy youngster who made it a career ambition to overhaul Jack Nicklaus' record of 18 major titles.
Greg Norman and Fred Couples were also in the group and they listened in disbelief while Woods contemplated carrying his drive over the fairway bunker down the right of Augusta's par-five second hole.

""We were laughing at him just talking about it, but then he actually did it,"" Williams recalled in the interview which publicises the caddie's recent autobiography Out of the Rough.
Their first major triumph came at the 1999 PGA Championship when Williams gave an accurate read for a crucial putt on the 16th hole of the final round.
""That was the moment between him and me that created a real, true bond and got us going,"" he said.
Even though it was a vital putt, Williams had absolute confidence in his judgement. Indeed, he says the only time has ever been nervous caddying was in a bizarre and unrelated situation at the following year's US Open.
This was during Woods' epic 15-shot victory at Pebble Beach. The third round resumed early on the Sunday and Williams was unaware Woods had taken balls from his golf bag to practise his putting back at the hotel.
It meant they had to complete the closing half-dozen holes with only three balls in the bag. When one became scuffed and the oblivious Woods gave it to a young spectator, Williams started to panic.
The caddie's discomfort grew even greater when his boss drove into the ocean on the final tee, leaving just one ball left. ""Put it this way, if he'd not found the fairway with the next I'd not be here talking to you now,"" Williams smiled.
The notion of a smiling Williams is somewhat removed from the scowling figure who often acted as much as a bouncer as a bagman in his dealings on the course. He would aggressively silence stray camera clicks and other elements that might put off his player.
""I tried to give Tiger the same playing field as everyone else,"" Williams said.  ""Sometimes people send you over the edge, but it's just how it was at the time and I don't regret anything that I did.
""Often to the general public it wasn't acceptable,"" he continued. ""But they didn't know the full story of what was behind the scenes and what actually happened.""
The same can be said of Williams' ignorance of  Woods' multiple marital affairs that signalled the golfer's downfall in 2009. ""I had no idea what was going on,"" he said.
These revelations ultimately put an intolerable strain on their partnership.
""The relationship was stretched to the max and it was never quite the same, we just didn't connect after that,"" he said.
As was well publicised at the time of his book's publication in New Zealand, Williams uses its pages to complain of, at times, being ""treated like a slave"" by Woods.
The caddie has acknowledged it was an poor choice of words, but within context this simile does feel a little more acceptable than when taken in isolation.
And it is impossible to imagine him resorting to such a phrase when describing his working relationship with the amiable Scott.
Williams is helping the Australian at the biggest tournaments this year and the burly New Zealander inherits one of the game's form players.
Scott won twice during the recent Florida swing, including the World Golf Championship event at Doral earlier this month. Despite these successes, Scott will bench his British caddie David Clark to harness Williams' expertise at next month's Masters.
""Caddying for Adam has been like a breath of fresh air for me,"" said Williams, who was at Scott's side for his 2013 Augusta triumph. ""I'm really looking forward to seeing if he can win one more.
""I always say to Adam, many players win one major and that's great but to be recognised as one of the top players in the game... you want to have multiple majors beside your name.""
Williams watches no golf on television and back home in New Zealand lives life following his two great sporting passions - rugby union and motorsport.
But he says he will not be off the pace when he caddies for the first time this year at the season's opening major.
""I'll get a feel straight away,"" he said. ""It's just fantastic, I feel really privileged to be caddying for Adam and also to know I've had some part in developing his game.
""Dave Clark is doing a fantastic job out there, obviously. He's a guy like myself, one of the older caddies. He's got a young family, so he'll enjoy his time away now.
""He'll sit back while I caddie for a few tournaments and then he can come back and caddie for a few more. It's quite a good set-up.""
Williams accepts we are now in a post-Tiger era but believes golf is in great health with the likes of Scott, his compatriot Jason Day, Rory McIlroy and Jordan Spieth leading the way.
You sense his enthusiasm to return to the circus and satisfy his obvious competitive edge. This quality was at the heart of the long and successful partnership with Woods.
It was not about the money, it was about the winning.
But on the subject of cash, there was one question that had to be asked: ""Were you New Zealand's highest-paid sportsman for a while there?""
Williams laughed: ""I couldn't answer that question because I don't know what anyone else gets paid. I did very well out of caddying for Tiger, no-one's going to deny that.
""But look at the All Blacks and our other great sportsmen and I just couldn't tell you what they earn.""
These days Williams certainly trails financially in the wake of Dan Carter and co, but it would be no surprise if he banks another hefty cheque upon emerging from his semi-retirement at Augusta next month.","As Steve Williams prepares to help Adam Scott's quest for a second Masters title, the Kiwi caddie says his old boss Tiger Woods can still return to winning ways."
"Since the pair crashed in Spain in May, Hamilton has won four out of five races to move to within one point of Rosberg.
""Ever since the low of Barcelona I've been able to cultivate this really strong mental attitude,"" he said.
""I'm feeling fresh, powerful and confident heading to Hungary.""
World champion Hamilton, 31, has won four times in Hungary, but his last victory at the circuit came in 2013 and he was sixth last year.
""I have incredible support there, so I can't wait to get out on track,"" said the Briton.

"A Freedom of Information request revealed there were 634 reports in the 2015-16 financial year, compared with 316 the year before.
Police said the rise could have been caused by changes over which incidents schools can deal with internally.
An education expert called the figures ""worrying"" and said police needed to identify the reason for the increases.
John Howson, who is also a former teacher, said: ""I'm extremely worried about these figures - the doubling of the violence against a person, whatever source it is or however minor.""
Thames Valley Police said more incidents were now included in their figures after the Home Office clarified a policy about what must be investigated.
It added: ""Recorded violent crime went up in the Thames Valley overall last year by 30% so we would anticipate an increase in violence in schools as well.
""All schools in Thames Valley have contact with police through either dedicated schools officers or neighbourhood policing teams.
""Their approach is one of preventing young people from entering the criminal justice system rather than criminalising them.""

"The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service (Fas) said that Apple's local subsidiary told 16 retailers to maintain the recommended prices of phones in the iPhone 5 and iPhone 6 families.
Non-compliance with the pricing guidelines may have led to the termination of contracts, it found.
Apple has not yet responded to a request for comment.
At the time of the investigation, Apple denied that it controlled its products' pricing, telling Reuters that resellers ""set their own prices for the Apple products they sell in Russia and around the world"".
The regulator said Apple had now ended its price-fixing practices but has not said whether the company faces a fine.
The FAS claimed that Apple Rus monitored the retail prices for the iPhone 5c, 5s, 6, 6 Plus, 6s and 6s Plus.
""In the case of the establishment of 'inappropriate' prices, the Russian subsidiary of Apple sent emails to resellers asking them to change,"" the watchdog said.
The deputy head of the FAS, Andrey Tsarikovsky, added that ""Apple actively co-operated"" with the investigation and that the company had ""adopted the necessary measures to eliminate violations of the law"".
That included training employees in the ""anti-monopoly legislation norms"" in Russia.
In May, the FAS found that Google used its dominant position to force its own apps and services on users and fined it Â£5m ($6m).

"Only time will tell whether he gets his wish.
No-one should get too carried away, though.
Britain has had only a handful of non-white cabinet ministers. Indeed, Mr Cameron's new cabinet, following his election victory in May, has just two minority-ethnic cabinet ministers.
It is all a far cry from 1987, when four new black and minority-ethnic MPs - all Labour - entered the House, a symbolic and powerful moment for many observers.
Paul Boateng had the most successful ministerial career, eventually making it into the cabinet as chief secretary to the Treasury.
Much of the commentary focused on his being the first black cabinet minister and some speculated that he might rise to the very top. It was not to be. He now sits in the Lords.
Keith Vaz rose to become the first Asian minister in the Commons in 1999.
Mr Vaz's newsworthy quotes keep him in the public eye as the long-serving chairman of the home affairs select committee.
Diane Abbott has a big political and media profile but has stayed on the back benches, as did Bernie Grant, before his premature death.
The Tories at that time had no real equivalent representation in terms of black and minority-ethnic MPs.
There was a lingering suspicion that the majority of voters from these communities didn't like the Conservatives.
There was a damaging public row when a black candidate, John Taylor, was selected to fight Cheltenham in 1992. There was opposition from the local association and the campaign itself was marred by racist jibes. Taylor lost.
It was the Blair-Brown years that changed the landscape at ministerial level.
The Tottenham MP, David Lammy, was one early star. He rose quickly and, having been elected at just 27, he was immediately weighed down by the ""Britain's next black prime minister"" label.
He didn't last but he has reinvented himself as a vocal backbencher and is in the mix to be Labour's choice for London mayor.
Baroness Scotland, the first ethnic minority attorney general, was another prominent appointment. Then there was Shahid Malik, who became Britain's first Muslim minister in 2007.
When David Cameron came to power in 2010, he brought in Baroness Sayeeda Warsi. She was the first Muslim woman cabinet minister.
Her star burned brightly for a short time but she is no longer in government. Instead, she has carved a role as a critical voice, particularly on relations with the Muslim community.
Another casualty was Shailesh Vara, who lost his post as a government whip. He is currently parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Ministry of Justice. and remains influential in Tory attempts to appeal to the British Asian community.
The Liberal Democrats, now a crushed force in Westminster, did not have a single non-white MP in the 2010-15 Parliament.
The twists and turns of political life make predictions difficult.  The  Business Secretary Sajid Javid is seen by some as a future leader. His ethnicity - the son of an immigrant from Pakistan - is of less interest than his political views, perhaps another sign of a gradual shift in perceptions.
Priti Patel in the employment portfolio is another rising star - she became the first female minister of Indian descent last month.
Javid and Patel would once have been that rare breed - minority-ethnic Westminster politicians with right-wing views. No longer. Patel's beliefs on welfare reform attract more interest than her ethnicity.
On the Labour side, Chuka Ummuna was seen by many as the leading candidate to be the new Labour leader - until his withdrawal from the race. He entered Parliament just five years ago but is already a senior Labour figure and a regular on TV.
Sadiq Khan is another example of a big and influential Westminster politician, experienced in shadowing ministers, and now hoping to run for London mayor.
The new House of Commons has a record number of non-white MPs, who make up about 6% of the new Parliament, up from just over 4% in 2010.
Critics say this is encouraging but goes nowhere near far enough if Parliament is to truly represent all of the population.","David Cameron said in a speech last November that he wanted to see an ethnic minority prime minister to prove ""Britons of all backgrounds can achieve""."
"Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the identical twin brother of the late president and leader of the country's main opposition party, Law and Justice, is boycotting the official memorial events.
His supporters are also planning to gather outside the presidential palace to remember the victims and vent their anger against the Russians and the government for their handling of the crash investigation.
For a brief time the tragedy united the country in shock, at first, and then mourning for the victims.
Thousands came from all over the country to place flowers and candles in front of the presidential palace. They did so even if they opposed Lech Kaczynski's policies.
It was the nation's worst disaster since World War Two. Apart from the president and his wife, Maria, the crash claimed the lives of the commanders of the armed forces, the heads of the National Bank and Olympic Committee, and politicians from all parties.
The location of the disaster was hugely symbolic too. The delegation was on its way to attend a 70th anniversary ceremony of the Katyn massacre, one of Poland's most painful wartime events in which more than 20,000 Polish officers, the country's elite, were murdered on Stalin's orders.
It is perhaps not surprising that the unity did not last long. Lech Kaczynski was a divisive figure and many Poles disliked his nationalism and combative relations with Germany and Russia.
Divisions arose within days when it was announced that Lech Kaczynski and his wife would be buried among Poland's kings at Krakow's Wawel Cathedral. Many Poles felt the location was inappropriate.
Over the course of the year the tragedy has been used instrumentally by politicians here.
Clearly devastated by the death of his twin, sister-in-law, and many close friends and colleagues, Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a more aggressive and nationalist politician than his brother, has made the crash, and the investigation into it, the central issue for his party.
The investigation was carried out by the Russians because the crash happened at Smolensk military airfield near Katyn.
In January, the Russian investigation released its final report and found that the immediate cause of the crash was the pilots' decision to attempt to land despite extremely poor visibility caused by dense fog at the airfield.
The report also concluded that the pilots were put under pressure to attempt the landing because they expected a negative reaction from Lech Kaczynski if they decided to fly to a reserve airport with better weather conditions. That would have considerably delayed the delegation on its way to the Katyn memorial service.
The Polish government accepted the report's main findings but criticised the Russians for failing to investigate its own role in the tragedy, namely the actions of the air traffic controllers at Smolensk.
It was notable however that both countries' foreign ministers stressed that it would not derail the hitherto successful attempts to normalise relations.
But the fact that the investigation was seen by many here as being neither comprehensive nor fair raised old suspicions about the Russians.
It has also added fuel to conspiracy theories - such as that the Russians artificially created the fog to bring the plane down.
The majority of people here do not believe in those conspiracies, but an opinion poll this week found that 78% of respondents reckon the circumstances of the crash have not been fully cleared up.
Poland has yet to complete its own investigation into the disaster.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski does not accept the findings of the investigation. He has accused the government of ""servility"" towards the Russians who, he says, ""bear direct responsibility for the crash"".
He has said that it was Moscow which took the decision to allow the plane to land in such poor weather not the air traffic controllers.
The media has also played an important role over the year. With 24-hour rolling news and so much air time to fill barely a day goes by without a mention of the crash and some new development.
A recent survey said 78% of Poles were bored and irritated of hearing about it all the time. A group of students started a campaign on the social networking site Facebook to have one full day without mentioning the disaster.
The poll also found that 87% believed the crash was being used as a political tool.

"Ikechi Anya's breakaway goal after 10 minutes, reminiscent of his strike in Dortmund against Germany, proved to be the decisive moment in Prague.
Scotland might have had a second had Alan Hutton been awarded what looked like a clear-cut second-half penalty.
But Gordon Strachan's preparations for the World Cup qualifiers began with only a second-ever win over the Czechs.
They return home to face Denmark in another friendly at Hampden Park on Tuesday, with further matches in June against Italy and France before they begin World Cup qualifying against Malta in September.
Scotland manager Strachan spoke before the match of having picked difficult friendly opposition to help his players develop ahead of more meaningful fixtures.
The Czechs certainly provided a stern test, reinforcing their status as winners of a tough group in the Euro qualifiers.
They bombarded Allan McGregor's goal in the opening 20 minutes, only for the Hull goalkeeper to produce a string of saves to deny them.
He palmed Tomas Sivok's header round the post after Borek Dockal had smashed a free-kick off the bar.
A diving save to tip away Martin Frydek's rasping shot was the other highlight after Anya had bemused the home supporters by slotting Scotland in front.
The Watford man raced onto Ross McCormack's through ball down the left flank and finished strongly, first time, with his left foot.
The Scots' first-half display was littered with slack passes and a lack of concentration.
But they began to get the Czechs' measure and became more composed as the match progressed.
A flurry of substitutions on both sides also had a disruptive effect but Scotland looked assured in the second period and might have gone further ahead when substitute Matt Phillips saw his header from a Robert Snodgrass cross saved by Tomas Koubek.
But McGregor was called upon once more to make another top-class intervention, turning an effort by Lukas Marecek round the post.
Although the Scotland management team had stressed this was not an exercise in experimentation, Strachan took the opportunity to give Aberdeen midfielder Kenny McLean a debut.
Playing just behind McCormack, McLean found possession hard to come by in what was a tough introduction to international football, which lasted 57 minutes.
McCormack, given a rare chance in his first cap for two years, also lacked service but played a crucial role in Anya's goal, showing great strength and weight of pass to play the winger through.
There were late debuts too for striker Tony Watt and defender Paul Caddis, which would have told the manager little about their ability to handle this level of football, but offered them a moment to savour.

"Pamela Ramsey Taylor, who runs a local non-profit group in Clay county, will resume work on 23 December, the Charleston Gazette-Mail said.
The screen grab of the post was widely shared online.
Local mayor Beverly Whaling resigned over the controversy, after she posted ""Just made my day, Pam"" to the comment.
The Gazette-Mail quoted a letter from the acting director of the non-profit group as saying Ms Taylor would resume work at the Clay County Development Corp on 23 December.
In her Facebook post, Ms Taylor had said: ""It will be refreshing to have a classy, beautiful, dignified first lady in the White House. I'm tired of seeing a Ape in heels.""
A petition calling for Ms Taylor and Ms Whaling, the mayor of the town of Clay, to be sacked collected more than 85,000 signatures.
Clay town has a population of just 491 and has no African American residents, according to the 2010 census.
More than 98% of Clay County's 9,000 residents are white.
The Clay County Development group, of which Ms Taylor is the director, is partly funded through state and federal grants, and the group provides services to elderly and low-income residents.
The state commissioner, Robert Roswall, warned at the time that the agency risked losing funding over the issue.
The controversial Facebook post spread across US and international media outlets.
Ms Whaling issued a written apology, saying that her comment was not intended to be racist.
""I was referring to my day being made for change in the White House! I am truly sorry for any hard feeling this may have caused! Those who know me know that I'm not in any way racist!""
Clay's town council issued a brief statement apologising to Mrs Obama and condemning the ""horrific"" post and said ""racial intolerance isn't what this community is about"".
Ms Taylor told local news outlet WSAZ, which first carried the story, that she acknowledged her Facebook post could be ""interpreted as racist, but in no way was intended to be"", and that she was expressing a personal opinion on attractiveness, not the colour of a person's skin.
She told the news station she was considering legal action for slander against unnamed individuals.

"Scuffles broke out between Mr Zuma's supporters and opponents, resulting in all speeches being cancelled.
The main labour federation, Cosatu, called on Mr Zuma to step down last month after he sacked his widely respected finance minister.
Mr Zuma's allies say he will remain in office until his term ends in 2019.
He was seen on live television hastily leaving the podium and being whisked away in a motorcade from the rally in Bloemfontein city, Reuters news agency reports.
Mr Zuma attended the rally despite the fact that powerful affiliates of Cosatu, the Congress of South African Trade Unions, had opposed his presence.
Cosatu is part of a formal alliance with the governing African National Congress (ANC).
Earlier, sections of the crowd sang a song which, loosely translated, means: ""Have you heard the good news? Zuma is going"", South Africa's privately owned News24 site reports.
Cosatu leader Sdumo Dlamini said the rally had been marred by ""chaos"", forcing its cancellation.
The protest required ""thorough reflection"" on the part of the country's leaders, he said.
Senior ANC officials were also booed at a May Day rally in Durban city, the political heartland of Mr Zuma.
Pressure on Mr Zuma to resign has been mounting since he sacked Pravin Gordhan as finance minister in March.
It led to global rating agencies downgrading South Africa to junk status.
The reshuffle was condemned by trade unions, big business, the opposition and and senior members of the government, including Deputy President Cyril Rampahosa.
The opposition has repeatedly accused Mr Zuma of being corrupt, and says the reshuffle was aimed at giving him and his allies greater access to government money.
Mr Zuma said the reshuffle was aimed at promoting ""radical economic transformation"" to benefit the poor black majority.
South Africa's president has been dogged by allegations of corruption for more than a decade.
Last year, a court ruled that he should face corruption charges over a 1999 arms deal.
Mr Zuma is appealing against the ruling.
In a separate case last year, South Africa's highest court ruled that he had breached his oath of office by failing to repay government money used to upgrade his private residence.
He repaid the money, but rejected calls to step down.
Mr Zuma is due to step down as leader of the ANC in December, and as South Africa's president in 2019.
His ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma and Mr Rampahosa are vying to succeed him in both positions.",South Africa's scandal-hit President Jacob Zuma has abandoned a May Day rally after he was booed by workers demanding his resignation.

The All England Club said the courts were as ""playable as per normal"".
Temperatures have reached 30C at Wimbledon, with around 60 people treated by the St John Ambulance for heat-related symptoms on Thursday.
The Met Office is predicting highs of 26C on Friday and 23C on Saturday, but with more cloud cover on both days.
Mladenovic blamed the weather for making the courts too dry.
She said: ""The colour of the court, the fact that there's no more grass, the fact that the baseline where we are running, it's very slippery. There's no grass.
""You kind of have to run light and be careful, not to push or press too much, too hard, which is strange to play on.""
Mladenovic, who lost 2-6 6-4 6-4, added: ""It's quite unique with your opponent, after two games, you both agree on stopping playing in a Slam.

"Clough's 11th minute lob gave Wanderers a perfect start and the visitors were then indebted to Lee Burge for keeping them in the contest.
The City keeper saved from Gary Madine, Josh Vela and Clough on a night when former Bolton player and coach Gary Speed was honoured with a minute's applause by fans.
But if Burge excelled in the opening period, opposite number Ben Alnwick came to the Trotters' rescue in the second.
Having already denied Kyel Reid before the break, Alnwick saved superbly from Lewis Page plus substitutes Jodi Jones and Ruben Lameiras.
Bolton's best moment of the second half was Clough's 25-yard free-kick, which was tipped on to the post and away to safety by the outstanding Burge.
Coventry poured forward in search of a late equaliser to try to avoid a third straight league defeat, but instead, Phil Parkinson's side held on for their first home win over the Sky Blues in eight attempts since 1965.

"Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said his party would oppose it, unless they were promised a second referendum on the UK's Brexit deal with EU leaders.
Several Labour MPs are also willing to vote against it, despite the Labour Party pledging not to do so.
The government says Lib Dem and Labour MPs are ""trying to thwart and reverse the referendum result"".
With the support of Conservative MPs and the support or abstention of most Labour MPs, the bill is well placed to pass through the Commons.
But the opposition of some MPs is likely to embolden critics in the House of Lords.
The Liberal Democrats have long called for a referendum on the outcome of the government's negotiations with EU, but only now have they said they will definitely vote against Article 50 if their demand is not met.
Mr Farron, whose party has eight MPs in the Commons, told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""Article 50 would proceed but only if there is a referendum on the terms of the deal and if the British people are not respected then, yes, that is a red line and we would vote against the government.""
For Labour, shadow minister Catherine West, former leadership contender Owen Smith and south London MP Helen Hayes all made clear they were prepared to vote against Article 50 - which begins formal exit negotiations with the EU - if amendments were not accepted.
Former Labour minister David Lammy and shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner have said they would oppose Article 50. Opposition whip Thangam Debbonaire said she would also vote against it, if a vote were held imminently.
The SNP's 54 MPs may join them. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said they will not vote for anything that undermines the will of the Scottish people, and has previously said they will vote against a bill to write EU provisions into British law to prepare for Brexit.
Dulwich Labour MP Hayes said she was prepared to defy Labour whips to oppose the measure unless the government promised a second referendum.
She said: ""I had somebody in my surgery last week who was in tears because of Brexit and I see genuine distress amongst my constituents about what this path means.
""I would not be representing them if I voted to trigger Article 50 on the basis of no information from the government about the path that they would then take us on.""
In posts on Twitter and Facebook earlier this week, shadow Foreign Office minister Catherine West wrote: ""As I have said before, I stand with the people of Hornsey & Wood Green, and I will vote against Brexit in Parliament.""
Owen Smith confirmed to Today that if his bid for a second referendum failed, he was likely to oppose the bill.
The SDLP's three MPs will also oppose the measure.
Ministers said MPs voting against Article 50 would effectively be trying to re-run the referendum in the hope of a ""different answer"".
""Parliament voted by a margin of six to one to put the decision on whether to remain in or leave the EU in the hands of the British people,"" said Brexit minister David Jones.
""Only the Conservatives can be trusted to respect the outcome of the referendum and make a success of Brexit.""
Last week the High Court ruled Parliament must be consulted about leaving the European Union.
Unless the Supreme Court overturns the judgement in December, a bill to invoke Article 50 is expected in the new year.
Labour made clear its official position would be not to frustrate the process of leaving the EU after a newspaper report said the party leader Jeremy Corbyn intended to force a general election unless ministers caved in to demands.
After the story broke Labour sources said that while it would seek to amend the bill, it would provide ""unconditional"" support.
Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Labour would not frustrate the process and would not vote down Article 50.
However, Labour and Liberal Democrat peers will try to amend the bill in the House of Lords. So too will one Conservative peer - Baroness Wheatcroft.","Liberal Democrat, some Labour and SDLP MPs have told the BBC they are prepared to vote against triggering Article 50."

Everton have not won at Anfield since 1999 and, after conceding two quick goals before half-time, they never looked like taking the three points on Wednesday.

""We know we shouldn't have put a show on like this,"" said Martinez.

"Celtic had offered United £250,000 to take winger Mackay-Steven, 24, now rather than wait until the summer, a move that had already been agreed.
And the Glasgow club agreed a deal for both players of £2m plus add-ons.
""I'm delighted to be here and to have signed on at such a massive club,"" Armstrong, 22, told BBC Scotland.
Mackay-Steven added: ""I'm absolutely delighted to be here and to get everything done and dusted today. It's been a crazy few hours but I'm over the moon.""
Celtic's increased £1.6m offer for Armstrong had been rejected on Sunday before further talks took place on Monday.
The Scottish champions had a £1.5m offer for the Scotland Under-21 international rejected last week and Burnley also had a bid turned down.
The £250,000 offer for Scotland cap Mackay-Steven was £100,000 more than they had previously offered.
Armstrong, who has signed until 2018, and Mackay-Steven, whose deal runs until 2019, will be ineligible for Celtic's Scottish Cup meeting with Dundee on Saturday and next month's League Cup final meeting with their former club.
United defeated Aberdeen 2-1 at Hampden Park in Saturday's semi-final, with Celtic recording a 2-0 victory over Rangers the following day.
And United will ask for at least 17,500 tickets for the 15 March showpiece.

"A number of houses were broken into early on Monday, officers said.
Goods left outside affected homes in the Calderdale of West Yorkshire were also stolen, it emerged.
""It is impossible to comprehend why anyone would want to bring further suffering to those already in a very vulnerable situation,"" said acting Supt Mark Grange, of North Yorkshire Police.
Houses in Huntingdon Road, York, were targeted after the River Foss broke its banks, with one being looted after the back door was forced, as well as tools being taken from a shed at another property.
West Yorkshire Police said it had received reports of people using white vans to take ""dry goods left outside flooded homes"", in the Calderdale area.
No arrests have been made in connection with the thefts and burglaries, which emerged after the levels of the Foss dropped by several metres on Tuesday.
Six severe flood warnings, in place since Boxing Day, were lifted by the Environment Agency, which said emergency repairs to the Foss Barrier had allowed four of eight pumps to begin working again.

"Cook, 31, said he has ""questions"" over his role after England went 3-0 down after the fourth Test to lose the five-match series against India.
Despite suffering five defeats in the last seven Test matches, Stokes told BBC Sport: ""As a leader he's been brilliant and he still will be.
""He doesn't want anything except success for the team.""
Stokes, who has played all of his 31 Tests under Cook, added: ""Over the last two years, he's been absolutely fantastic.
""He has been part of the driving force of getting us to be the team we are today. Albeit we're 3-0 down, we've made huge strides since Australia (in 2013-14).
""Whatever happens, I'll have a lot of respect for him and whatever decision he makes - but I hope he sticks with what he's doing, because I think he's doing a great job.""
Cook, who turns 32 on Christmas Day, took over as captain from Andrew Strauss in 2012 and has led England in a record 58 Tests.
He presided over the Ashes series wins of 2013 and 2015, but came under intense pressure after the whitewash in Australia in 2013-14 and the following summer when England suffered defeats by Sri Lanka at Headingley and India at Lord's.
After the latest loss, Cook said batsman Joe Root is ""ready"" to take over as captain, but the left-handed opener will discuss his role with now director of cricket Strauss.

"He is the first serving head of state to come before the court in The Hague.
He was called to appear at the ICC ""status conference"" when the prosecution said evidence needed to go ahead with a trial was being withheld.
The charges - which Mr Kenyatta denies - concern his alleged role in violence following the 2007 elections.
More than 1,000 people died in the aftermath of the poll.
Mr Kenyatta says the charges against him are politically motivated and insists that the case should be thrown out.
The prosecution accuses the Kenyan government of obstructing the investigation.
The president temporarily relinquished power to come to The Hague. Nevertheless, his convoy received a presidential welcome. Flag-waving crowds surged as his police-escorted car pulled up. International TV crews jostled to get him in their frame.
But the trial has reached a deadlock. The prosecution accuse the Kenyan government of withholding vital evidence, the defence say without evidence there should be no trial. Around 100 politicians flew to The Hague. One of them told me they had all paid their own air fares, a public demonstration of support for their president.
About 1,200 Kenyans were killed in the violence - the case was sent to the ICC after Kenya failed to bring the perpetrators to justice. The judges must now decide whether to abandon the trial or give the prosecution more time to search for the missing evidence.
The ICC wants Mr Kenyatta to explain allegations that evidence against him had been withheld by the Kenyan government - a claim rejected by Kenyan Attorney-General Githu Muigai, who appeared before the court on Tuesday.
Scores of Mr Kenyatta's supporters packed the public gallery as the hearing got under way.
Defence lawyer Steven Kay said Mr Kenyatta would not be making a statement. He said the government had co-operated with the prosecution requests where it was possible to do so.
The hearing was later adjourned.
As he left the court Mr Kenyatta told his supporters in Swahili: ""We know where we are coming from, we know where we are now, we know where we are going. No-one will tell us where we are going and yes, we will decide for ourselves.""
ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, who is from The Gambia, said there was still a significant ""body of evidence"" against Mr Kenyatta.
The prosecution, which wants an indefinite adjournment, told the court it had phone data and nine witnesses who were willing to testify how Mr Kenyatta had funding links with the Mungiki sect which took part in the violence.
Fergal Gaynor, a lawyer for the victims, said they were entitled to know why witnesses for the prosecution had withdrawn from the case.
In September, the court postponed the trial after prosecutors said the Kenyan government had failed to deliver key documents.
Deputy President William Ruto is acting president while Mr Kenyatta is at The Hague.
On Monday, the president again stressed his innocence, saying his conscience was clear.
In a speech to the Kenyan parliament, Mr Kenyatta said that he was going to The Hague in a personal capacity - not as president of the country - so as not to compromise the sovereignty of Kenyans.
No special arrangements have been made at the ICC. The main spokesperson for the court said that Mr Kenyatta would not be treated differently from any other accused person.
Mr Kenyatta was elected in 2013, despite facing charges. Analysts said he turned the prosecution to his advantage, portraying it as foreign intervention in Kenya's domestic affairs.
Mr Kenyatta has accused the court of being biased against African leaders.
In 2009 the ICC also issued a warrant for Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir over alleged war crimes in Darfur, but he has not yet been arrested.
Mr Kenyatta faces five charges relating to the ethnic massacres - the worst violence in Kenya since independence in 1963. Tens of thousands of people were displaced and Kenya's reputation for stability was tarnished.
Mr Kenyatta was a close ally of President Mwai Kibaki, who was declared the winner of the 2007 election. Mr Kibaki's rival, Raila Odinga, claimed the poll was marred by fraud.
The dispute took on an ethnic dimension, pitting members of the Kikuyu ethnic group of Mr Kenyatta and Mr Kibaki against other communities such as the Luo and Kalenjin. Mr Kenyatta is accused of organising an ethnic Kikuyu gang, the Mungiki sect, to attack rival groups.
Deputy President Ruto also faces charges at The Hague, but he was on Mr Odinga's side during the violence. He also denies the charges.","Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has appeared before the International Criminal Court (ICC), where he faces charges of crimes against humanity."
"Abbey Road is full of gremlins.
Giles Martin - son of record producer George Martin - can't play any music through his mixing desk at the iconic North London studios.
He re-boots his computer while two engineers crawl on the floor, plugging in cables and fiddling with various switches. At one point, someone unplugs a hard drive.
""Oh God, you've just deleted the Beatles,"" Martin deadpans.
Eventually, the equipment springs to life. The producer dismisses a workman, who has appeared to drill locks into the door, and apologises for the delay.
""I just moved into this studio yesterday,"" he explains.
With that, Martin loads up a file that contains dozens of versions of the Beatles' back catalogue. There are the original recordings, mono mixes, stereo remasters and various other snippets - all of which Martin can flick between at will.
He used these tracks as a reference while producing a new DVD compilation, Beatles 1+, which sees the Fab Four's biggest hits re-imagined in stereo and 5.1 surround sound, accompanied by restored promotional videos and films.
""The goal is to bring the band closer to you,"" says Martin. ""To have that same feeling at home that I get when I put on the tapes in the studio.""
Rather than viewing the originals as sacred, the band appreciate their music being tweaked this way, he says.
""My dad went to see John Lennon in 1980 before he died, and John said to him: 'Do you know what I'd really like to do? I'd love to record everything again.'
""Dad said, 'Really? How about Strawberry Fields?'
""And John said: 'Especially Strawberry Fields.'""
Counter-intuitively, Martin's new mixes are often simpler than the existing stereo versions - but he has a solid explanation.
Up to Yellow Submarine, the Beatles treated the mono mixes of their albums as the definitive documents. The stereo versions were created as an afterthought, often without the band's involvement.
""My dad was never happy with the extreme panning that went on,"" explains the producer. ""You'd have the band on one side and all the vocals on the other.
""And you have what I call the socks and sandals brigade saying: 'The only way to listen to Sgt Pepper's is in mono.' To be honest, they're probably right, but no-one does that any more.""
So he set about recapturing the power of those mono recordings. ""In Beatles world, if you can make something more aggressive, they want it more aggressive,"" Martin says, cueing up Paperback Writer to prove his point.
""If you listen, this mono mix is very crunchy, very in your face,"" he says, as the textured harmonies give way to Paul McCartney's guitar riff.
""The stereo sounds wider,"" Martin continues, switching seamlessly to that version, ""but the problem is that all the action - the guitar and drums - are on the left speaker.""
""The guitar riff is what you remember about that song,"" he says, but it loses its oomph by being shifted to one side. Accordingly, the new mix puts the instruments into a focussed central point, while spreading the vocals across the front speakers.
The rear speakers present a separate challenge. Rather than placing Ringo's drums behind the listener, or making vocals circle the room, Martin opts for restraint.
""Dolby came to see me with 5.1 when it was new,"" he explains, ""and they'd mixed What's Going On by Marvin Gaye in surround sound, with the guitar coming out of the right rear speaker.
""But if you went to see Marvin Gaye performing and his guitar player decided to stand at the back of the audience with his amp, you'd go: 'Could you put him on the stage, please?'""
Over-using those rear channels is ""really distracting,"" Martin argues, so he came up with an ingenious solution. He went into Abbey Road's Studio 2, wired up a ""really big"" loudspeaker and played the original Beatles recordings at full volume.
""We acted like the band were playing in there again, and recorded the walls using the original Beatles microphones,"" he says. Those reverberations and echoes were then placed into the rear speakers to give ""the illusion of being in the room with the band"".
""And they are really good as a band,"" Martin says. ""That sounds stupid, but they do actually make a good sound. You want to get the least stuff between that and what's at home.""
With the later Beatles recordings, however, he had more opportunity to be playful.
""Strawberry Fields is more of a sound picture than a song,"" Martin says, scrolling over to John Lennon's masterpiece, and locating the descending svarmandal figure (the one that sounds like a sitar) between the first chorus and second verse.
""On the stereo remaster, the svarmandal does something cool - it pans. So in our new version, we can steal that and make it even better. Now it goes around all five speakers like a horseshoe.""
But Martin also made a more elemental tweak.
""The mono Strawberry Fields - the one the Beatles mixed - is slightly more intense and more condensed. There's a mellotron pulse under John's voice which forms a sort of harmonic for his vocal. In the stereo it's off to one side and, as a result, John's voice sounds thinner.
""I said: 'OK, if we're doing a new mix of this, we should do one that sounds like the mono. So we came up with this,"" he says, pressing play on the updated version which, it has to be said, sounds much more fulsome.
In making such decisions, Martin tried to put himself into the mindset of John, Paul, Ringo and the two Georges as they worked - just metres away from where he's sitting - in the 1960s.
""All of the songs should sound like you remember them,"" he says. ""It's not meant to be the 'Giles Martin version'. I work for the Beatles.""
Martin confesses to one glaring mistake: The stereo mix of Lennon and McCartney's kitchen sink symphony A Day In The Life is missing a piano, because he opted to use the version created for the Cirque Du Soleil show, Love.
""All of these fans will be going: 'Why did you take this piano off?' And the answer is I didn't - I just used the Love version,"" he cringes.
Martin is modest about his achievements, saying more than once that ""there's no talent in what I do"". And he admits his every decision will be pored over by Beatles obsessives.
""There are people who know this material better than I do,"" he says. ""But generally I get a pretty good ride. They know I do it because I care, rather than showboating and going: 'This is how I think they should sound.'""
Ultimately, he would have liked to be more inventive with the surround mixes but had to ""rein myself in, because these are the Beatles number one hits"".
""If I was doing a 5.1 of the White Album, though? Let me at it!""

Mr Morris, 29, was left with a four-inch hole in his skull and needed emergency surgery.
Pipe had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
Jailing Pipe at Bristol Crown Court, Judge Mark Horton called the player a ""talented man with too much time and too much money''.
He added: ''A tragedy would be too small a word to describe the tale which has led us to this courtroom.""

"It's the first time - and probably the only time - this information will be made public.
The review will be published at 11:00 BST and details of anyone earning more than £150,000 a year will be included.
The report will also look at TV and radio viewing figures, as well as online engagement.
It may also examine the issue of the competition, such as Netflix.
It looks back over the previous year's performance and publishes details about the corporation's finances and spending. This year's edition could prove more interesting than most.
It's all down to the government's culture secretary, Karen Bradley.
Speaking in the House of Commons last September, Mrs Bradley said publishing the salaries of stars earning more than £150,000 would bring the BBC ""in line with the civil service"" on transparency.
The culture secretary said it would help ensure the BBC ""produces value for money for the licence fee"" and that more transparency could lead to savings that could be ""invested in even more great programmes"".
But the BBC's director general, Tony Hall, has said: ""Our position on talent pay has not changed and all major broadcasters have questioned the merit of the proposal.
""The BBC operates in a competitive market and this will not make it easier for the BBC to retain the talent the public love.""
ITV's programmes chief, Kevin Lygo, also called the proposal a ""mean-spirited, nosey way of looking at things"" during last year's Edinburgh Television Festival.
The corporation already reveals the salary details of on-air stars who earn more than £450,000 and executives who earn more than £150,000.
Presenters such as Graham Norton, Gary Lineker, Claudia Winkleman, Chris Evans, Fiona Bruce and Andrew Marr could easily be on the list.
The revelations are required under the BBC's new Royal Charter, and are expected to encompass more than 100 of its top stars.
According to last year's annual report, 109 TV and radio presenters earned more than £150,000 in the financial year 2015-16. But they were not named at the time.
Some have.
Speaking at the China Exchange last month, Andrew Marr said of the plans to formally spell out pay: ""It's uncomfortable for all of us.
""I'm well paid but I'm much less overpaid, perhaps, than people working for rival organisations who won't go through this process,"" reported the Telegraph.
But Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman said ahead of Karen Bradley's announcement last year: ""I'm all for it. I totally understand it. We're working for the public, so why shouldn't they know?
""It's good to see some women on the list too.
""We get paid an awful lot of money and it's a marketplace. It's bonkers.""
She added: ""I love working for the BBC. I know that commercial stations pay a whole lot more - double, three times, four times. But I totally understand why people would want to know.""
By revealing talent pay, we might also find out if there is any gender disparity.
We should also find out how the BBC's television and radio channels and stations have performed over the last year.
And it's also a chance to discover more about the BBC's audiences - who is tuning in to TV, radio and the websites, for instance. (The BBC is struggling to attract younger audiences, as it faces competition from YouTube, social media and gaming).
Trust issues in news and the rise of competition from the likes of Netflix (which released impressive growth numbers this week)  and Amazon Prime could also feature.
Not necessarily. From next year, some salaries may not be disclosed if the stars are employed by the newly-formed BBC Studios. This programme-making division is  being turned in to a commercial operation and will operate and be treated in the same way as an independent production company.

"But he will kick off a career path that very few of his fellow footballers have ever gone down before this weekend when he will be back on the front cover - this time to highlight his work as an accomplished artist.
Former defender Craddock, now 42, was already gaining notoriety for his artwork long before his retirement from football in May 2013.
And, although he admits his past footballing connections do still open some doors, his continuing success in this new environment has rarely involved actually painting anything to do with this country's national game.
But he has been persuaded by John Hendley and Paul Berry in the club's media department to do the front cover artwork for all of Wolves' home match programmes this season, starting with Saturday's Championship opening day fixture against Middlesbrough.
""They first approached me a few years ago,"" Craddock, who still lives in the same house in the village of Cookley, near Kidderminster, Worcestershire, which he and wife Shelley chose when he first arrived from Sunderland in 2003, told BBC Sport.
""I just didn't have the time or the ideas then. I was still playing, which made it more difficult, so I declined.
""But when they came back to me again I couldn't turn it down a second time,"" added Craddock, who is still a regular at matches at Molineux with the couple's three boys Joseph, Luke and Toby.
""I've had to give it a lot of thought as to what might appeal to the fans. The idea I had was kind of comic-book heroes. But also taking into account that, at Wolves, we already have our heroes on the pitch, the Billy Wrights and all the other legends of the club.
""My regular stuff can take two to three weeks to do. I couldn't do that with these as, with 23 programme covers, that would take me over a year and a half. But I've been working hard for the past four months to get them all ready in time.""
Having met his own personal deadline to get all the covers done in time for the start of the new English Football League season this weekend, Craddock was forced into a rethink when he heard of the plight of his former Wolves team-mate Carl Ikeme, 31, who was diagnosed with leukaemia at the start of July.
It is a disease that has touched the Craddock family too. His youngest son Toby was also diagnosed with leukaemia in 2012 at the age of two and a half.
Craddock's original choice for the front cover for Saturday's game with Middlesbrough was former West Ham United, Manchester United, Inter Milan, Liverpool and England captain Paul Ince, who put in sterling service late in his career with both Boro and Wolves.
But Craddock also wanted to show his support to Ikeme. And the solution was simple. He just went back to his easel and knocked out another picture, in tribute to the goalkeeper.
The club will now not only use that as the front cover on Saturday but also the legendary Ince on page three - to give the fans a taster of what is to come.
Most of Craddock's professional artwork these days is non-football related.
He held his first exhibition, ""Le Bellezza Della Fusione"", demonstrating his own, unique style of portraiture, graffiti and photorealism, over in Leicestershire in 2015. And he is booked in to do the same at a gallery in Chester this autumn.
But the sight of a football net in his back garden in Cookley absolutely festooned with kids' footballs is a reminder that he is a football man and also a football fan at heart.
And his portraits of past and present players, whether Pele or John Terry, or simply his regular commissions for ex-Wolves players, are a reminder that he too is excited at the start of another new season - especially at Molineux, where Wolves' Chinese owners Fosun have spent big on new signings, including new club record purchase Ruben Neves.
But are Wolves in the frame to repeat the promotion Craddock and his team-mates enjoyed from the Championship under Mick McCarthy in 2009?
""Another new manager has come in,"" he said. ""There's a lot of new players and everybody wants to impress.
""It's so physically demanding in this league, playing Saturday/Tuesday all the time. But, if we can keep the injuries down, then we're all excited about what's to come this season.""",Jody Craddock was accustomed to seeing his face on the front cover of the match programme at Molineux during his 10 largely successful years as a Wolves player.
"Alfie Hyett was found by his mother Louise Hembrow at home in Hereford last March.

When the inquest opened in June, Mark Bricknell, senior coroner for Herefordshire, heard Alfie died of vagal inhibition, which causes the heart to stop through the stimulation of the vagus nerve in the neck.
Before the inquest, Ms Hembrow told the BBC she believed her son had taken part in the game where the brain is starved of oxygen to create an adrenalin rush.
However, Det Sgt Mark Jinks, from West Mercia Police, said there was no evidence he had researched the game or discussed it with friends.

"The first was for the development of tidal arrays in Alderney's waters.
The second involves the development of an electricity interconnector cable between France, Alderney and Britain.
Paul Clark, chief executive officer, said it was a move towards the creation off Alderney of one of Europe's largest tidal stream developments.
Alderney Renewable Energy (ARE) was set up in 2004 and holds an exclusive licence to commercially develop tidal and wave power around the coast of the northern most of the Channel Islands.
The first agreement was signed with French industrial group DCNS and the second with ARE, its partner Transmission Capital and the French grid operator RTE.
ARE said the electricity interconnector cable between France, Alderney and Britain would enable the export of up to four gigawatts of tidal power from Alderney.
It said the cable, known as the FABLink, could also be used as a power trading link between the two countries.
The agreements were signed at the Anglo-French summit held in Paris, with the French Industry Minister Eric Besson and the UK Energy Secretary Ed Davey signing on the behalf of their governments.
Mr Davey said: ""We are determined to promote the potential of marine energies. We welcome the plan for a tidal turbine farm off Alderney in the Channel Islands.""
He said: ""We believe this project could encourage the emergence of industrial co-operation between France and the UK, while opening up new international prospects.
""We acknowledge the importance of developing new electricity interconnectors between our two countries in order to strengthen further the linking of our grids, improve the security of our energy supplies and facilitate the integration of intermittent energy sources.""","Two agreements have been signed aimed at creating one of the most significant tidal power sites in Europe, Alderney Renewable Energy has announced."

But more than 100 people have signed an online petition against the plans.
Headteacher Sue Collins said the school was having to manage an £800,000 per year cut in its budget from the government.
The Chromebooks for Learning Scheme will affect hundreds of students at the school, which has more than 1,500 pupils aged from 11-19, with only years 11 and 13 exempt.

Senior official Stephen McGeehan said the GAA is willing to consider a capacity below 38,000, the number of seats in the original redesign plan.
A new community consultation about the proposal was announced on Tuesday.
""The GAA has no intention, and never had, of knocking people's houses down, of purchasing or demolishing anyone's homes,"" said Mr McGeehan, who is the Casement Park project manager.
Planning permission for the stadium's redevelopment was overturned in 2014 and since then the GAA has been working on a new planning application.
The GAA said it wants to hear feedback from people in west Belfast and further afield about the proposed new stadium and has organised a number of consultation initiatives.
The GAA has laid out a proposed timetable for the stadium:

"Their analysis of stool samples in a study of more than 3,600 twins found evidence that some of this bacteria is inherited.
What is contained in faeces bacteria could therefore partly explain why obesity passes down through families.
The study is published in Genome Biology.
The research team extracted information from study participants about the human faecal microbiome - the bacteria present in faeces samples - and compared these to six different measures of obesity, including body mass index (BMI) and different types of body fat.
iWonder - What does your poo say about you?
The researchers found the strongest links with visceral fat, where participants with a high diversity of bacteria in their faeces had lower levels of visceral fat.
This type of body fat is bad news because it is stored in the stomach area around important organs such as the liver, pancreas and intestines and is linked with higher risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
Dr Michelle Beaumont, lead study author from the department of twin research and genetic epidemiology at King's College London, said although the study showed a clear link, it was not yet possible to explain why it existed.
One theory is that a lack of variety in faecal bacteria could lead to the domination of high levels of gut microbes which are good at turning carbohydrates into fat.
Dr Beaumont said: ""As this was an observational study we cannot say precisely how communities of bacteria in the gut might influence the storage of fat in the body, or whether a different mechanism is involved in weight gain.""
And she indicated more research was needed to investigate how microbes in our guts and in our faeces can influence our health.
But there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that gut bacteria may play a role in obesity.
It is known that at least 50% of human faeces is made up of bacteria shed from the gut.
Dr Beaumont said that eating a broad diet including a variety of different types of food - much like that of the early hunter-gatherers - could increase the diversity of microbes in our faeces.
If the theory that microbes are passed on down the generations is correct, she said they may play an important role in how fat develops around the body and the health risk it presents.","The make-up of the bacteria found in human faeces may influence levels of dangerous fat in our bodies, say researchers from King's College London."
"""The company confirmed that it received a subpoena from the SEC in the fourth quarter of 2015,"" said Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little.
Valeant, which has been struggling to maintain investor confidence amid mounting scandals, said the SEC probe was one of ""several ongoing investigations"".

"Defcad, as the firm will be known, has already been dubbed the Pirate Bay of 3D printing.
The site will become a ""search engine for 3D printing,"" according to its founders.
But its flouting of copyright is likely to face legal challenges.
The firm is the brainchild of Cody Wilson, law student and self-styled crypto-anarchist.
Last year he set up Defense Distributed, a project aiming to print gun parts.
The project provoked controversy with 3D printing firm MakerBot pulling gun part blueprints from its website in the wake of the Sandy Hook shootings and 3D printer manufacturer Stratasys refusing permission for its machines to be used by the company.
It is also facing legal challenges to shut the site down.
Despite the set-backs, it released a video this month demonstrating an AR-15 with a 3D printed part firing more than 600 rounds.
Meanwhile its blueprints at non-profit Defcad.org have seen 400,000 downloads since the site was launched, according to founder Cody Wilson.
Announcing the new for-profit Defcad.com at the South by South West conference in Texas, Mr Wilson said it was an obvious next step for the wiki weapon project.
""Help us turn Defcad into the world's first unblockable, open-source search engine for 3D printable parts,"" says Mr Wilson in the video posted on the website looking for funding.
In the video, Mr Wilson said the revolution which many predict 3D printing will bring about will only happen if it can be freed from corporate ties.
The blueprints available on the site will be for ""important stuff"", he said. ""Not trinkets, not garden gnomes but the things institutions and industries have an interest in keeping from us; access, medical devices, drugs, goods, guns.""
""Supplying consumers with blueprints to print products designed by third parties is a business model fraught with risk,"" said Lorna Caddy of law firm Taylor Wessing.
""Many of those products will be protected by intellectual property rights, such as design law. Owners of those rights could assert them in the courts to prevent their designs being further distributed and to seek financial compensation,"" she added.","The company that developed 3D printed gun parts has announced plans to launch a new firm, dedicated to copyright-free blueprints for a range of 3D printable objects."
"Downing Street has publicly rebuked the foreign secretary for accusing UK ally Saudi Arabia of engaging in ""proxy wars"" in the Middle East.
Number 10 said his views did not represent ""the government's position"".
Sir Malcolm Rifkind, a former Conservative foreign secretary, said ""the jury is out"" on Mr Johnson's future in the job.
He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Johnson was not entitled to make public statements which are ""completely at variance with what the government line is"", and the prime minister was right to slap him down.
Sir Malcolm said: ""If he wants to be foreign secretary for the foreseeable future - and he could be a very good one, he's a highly intelligent guy... it's the question of his temperament"".
Mr Johnson is to deliver a keynote speech at a major regional conference in Bahrain on Friday before heading to Saudi Arabia on Sunday.
Theresa May's official spokeswoman said the prime minister had ""full confidence"" in Mr Johnson but that his comments at a conference in Italy were his own personal view.
She added that Mr Johnson will have the opportunity to set out official policy - of Britain's desire to strengthen its ties with Saudi Arabia and support for its controversial military involvement in Yemen - when he travels to the desert kingdom.
Sir Malcolm said: ""He's often been in this situation before, and he's got a remarkable use of language.""
However, if Mr Johnson persists in offering his personal view in public, Sir Malcolm said: ""I think inevitably the prime minister would say - look is his role adding to the benefits for the United Kingdom"".
""He might end up being more comfortable in another senior cabinet position"".
Mr Johnson's comments were made at a conference last week but only emerged after the The Guardian newspaper published footage of the event.
In it the foreign secretary said: ""There are politicians who are twisting and abusing religion and different strains of the same religion in order to further their own political objectives.
""That's one of the biggest political problems in the whole region. And the tragedy for me - and that's why you have these proxy wars being fought the whole time in that area - is that there is not strong enough leadership in the countries themselves.""
In defence of Mr Johnson, Tory colleague and housing minister Gavin Barwell said: ""It's his job to set out the concerns that we have.""
He told the Daily Telegraph newspaper that Saudi Arabia was a ""friend"" but he added: ""Many of our constituents have concerns and it's quite right that we should raise them.""
Meanwhile, Tory backbencher Sarah Wollaston tweeted: ""Boris was speaking the truth on proxy wars and it's time for all parties in the region to end the sectarian bloodbath.
""To proxy wars charge I'd add beheadings, judicial mutilations, torture, violation of women's human rights through male guardianship, unfair trials, gross restrictions on free speech, rights of assembly and association, bombing civilians in Yemen.""
Mr Johnson's speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) Manama Dialogue event in Bahrain will be closely watched at home and abroad.
Dr John Chipman, director-general and chief executive of the IISS, said: ""Each year, with this regional security summit, we take the temperature, measure the pulse, and analyse the direction of change in the Middle East.
""I am delighted that Boris Johnson has agreed to give the keynote speech and we expect delegates to be keenly interested in his views on the region and on UK strategy towards it.""
Sir Malcolm, who was foreign secretary between 1995 and 1997, said that Mr Johnson has made an ""extraordinary impact"" as a celebrity, but he warned: ""As a foreign secretary you can't be a celebrity.""
""Harold MacMillan was once foreign secretary, and in his memoirs he said: 'Foreign Ministers are either dull or dangerous'. Well Boris certainly isn't dull.""",Boris Johnson is to begin a tour of the Middle East amid a row over comments he made about Saudi Arabia.
"The surprising discovery suggests that the birds are preparing their offspring for warm conditions after they hatch.
Scientists collected eggs and incubated them in controlled conditions, playing recordings of the incubation song.
Compared to a control group, hatchlings that received these calls grew more slowly and coped better in the heat.
Writing in the journal Science, the researchers say this is the sort of adaptation that could help animals acclimatise to rising global temperatures.
""It doesn't mean that they will still be able to breed at extreme temperatures - this was within the range they currently experience,"" said the paper's lead author Mylene Mariette, from Deakin University in Geelong.
""But what's encouraging is that it's a strategy that the birds use to adjust the growth of their offspring to temperature, that we didn't know about.""
It is also the first time that singing to unborn chicks has been shown to yield such long-term results.
Previous studies have mostly concentrated on egg-bound embryos learning particular calls from their parents.
""We knew it could have some short-term effects on cognition and learning, but our study is the first to show that is has an effect on their growth and their development - and that those effects last until adulthood,"" Dr Mariette told BBC News.
""It means that the acoustic environment before birth has more impact than we thought.""
She first noticed the rhythmic, high-pitched calls while making field recordings during her PhD.
""I was looking at how the parents talk to each other to coordinate parental care. That's when I noticed that sometimes when a parent was by itself in the nest, incubating the egg, it produced a quite different call.
""I wondered - hmm, are they talking to their eggs?""
When she started to study this squeaky serenade in detail, combing through Dr Mariette found that the birds were specifically singing it in the few days before eggs hatched - and only when the day's ambient temperature rose above about 26C.
""It's not that they do it spontaneously whenever it's hot; they do it when it's hot and when the embryos could potentially hear them,"" she said.
To figure out the specific effect of the calls, Dr Mariette and her colleague Katherine Buchanan used zebra finches living in the university's outdoor aviaries.
They collected eggs and, for the final five days of their incubation, played them either a recording of the birds' special egg-song, or a typical parent-to-parent call instead.
As soon as they hatched, the 175 chicks were returned to various nests and the team observed the youngsters' development in detail.
To begin with, the two groups were indistinguishable; the song hadn't changed the chicks' hatching weight.
Within a few days, however, that changed.
""We found that, depending on whether or not they had heard the 'hot call' from their parents, they reacted differently to heat,"" Dr Mariette explained.
""They adjusted their growth to temperature differently, and also solicited food from their parents differently.""
Specifically, the ""heat song"" seemed to make the chicks develop slower - and remain lighter - if their nest was in a hot corner of the aviary.
Being a lightweight is generally bad news in evolutionary terms, but when the researchers followed the finches' fortunes into adulthood, it proved the opposite: those lighter birds that grew up in hot nests produced significantly more fledglings than their heavier childhood companions.
Furthermore, the chicks that were primed with a ""heat song"" in the egg went on to prefer warmer nesting spots.
""It's as if the parents are preparing the chicks for the temperature they will experience after hatching,"" said Dr Mariette.
It is a mystery, she added, how being smaller gives the birds an advantage in the heat. But it may be because growing in hot conditions is costly for the body, placing more oxidative stress on tissues - so staying small becomes a better strategy.
This could also help explain why, as global temperatures rise, wild bird populations in general are slowly shrinking - though mostly, that process has been seen to have negative consequences for the species involved.
Whatever their evolutionary implications, the Deakin team's findings are an intriguing case of communication between parents and unborn offspring.
Nicola Hemmings, a research fellow studying bird reproduction at Sheffield University in the UK, said the experiments were elegantly designed and the results convincing.
""They've shown that not only can parents teach their offspring a call while they're still in the egg - but that they're giving them quite specific information about the environment they're about to hatch into,"" she told the BBC.
Just like the study's authors, Dr Hemmings said she was fascinated by what might be driving the changes in the chicks' development.
""They're not actually thinking, 'Mum says it's hot out there, I better take it slow when I get outside!' But it's having some kind of physiological effect on their body which is making their growth rate slow.
""Does it have a hormonal basis? Is it a stress response? That would be the interesting thing to look at next.""

"Pro-democracy activists have staged huge protests, the most recent on the 1 July anniversary of the day Hong Kong was handed back to China from Britain.
They have threatened to occupy parts of the city if their demands are not met.
Public discontent in Hong Kong is at its highest for years with concern over Beijing's influence over elections.
The city's police estimated Sunday's turnout at more than 110,000 people, but a specialist polling group based at the University of Hong Kong put the figure at around 80,000.
""We want to let the world know that we want peace, we want democracy, but please, do not threaten us, do not try to turn this place into a place of violence,"" Robert Chow, co-founder of the pro-government Alliance for Peace and Democracy told AFP.
Political rallies are a common sight in Hong Kong, a special Chinese city with a high level of freedom.
But large-scale demonstrations supportive of the Chinese government in Beijing are extremely rare.
The demonstrators -- much older than their pro-democracy rivals and clearly mobilised by dozens of pro-China clan organisations -- carried signs opposing the civil disobedience movement called Occupy Central.
Questions have been raised about the legitimacy of the demonstration.
Hong Kong media reports have suggested some companies and business groups had asked their employees to take part.
Despite those controversies, Johnson Yeung, a pro-democracy activist who organised the recent 1 July protest, told BBC News the rally was indeed an historic event.
""For the first time since the handover in 1997, the central government has organised a mass rally of this scale. It really shows their commitment against Occupy Central.""
The large turnout is a reminder there is still no consensus in the battle for Hong Kong's political future.
In the other camp, pro-democracy activists from the ""Occupy Central"" group have said they would mobilise protesters to take over some of the busier areas of the central business district if electoral reform is not put in place.
City authorities say such an occupation would be illegal however, and argue that it could tarnish Hong Kong's reputation.
Hong Kong's next elections will take place in 2017, and China says it will introduce universal suffrage for the vote.
However the current Chief Executive of Hong Kong CY Leung was elected by a committee largely loyal to the Chinese government.
The pro-democracy protesters fear that the shortlist of candidates to replace him will be a similar group also loyal to Beijing.
The chief executive is currently elected by a 1,200-member election committee. A majority of the representatives are viewed as pro-Beijing.
The Chinese government has promised direct elections for the leader, known as the chief executive, by 2017.
However, voters will only have a choice from a list of candidates selected by a nominating committee, and Beijing has said all candidates must be ""patriotic"".
Activists fear China will use the committee to screen out candidates it disapproves of.","A major pro-government rally in Hong Kong is drawing in thousands of supporters, in response to civil disobedience campaigns by activists."
"But back in the Indian Ocean island nation, many Tamils are either too scared of official retribution, or too apathetic to mark the second 27 November commemoration since the rebels' defeat last year.
The Sri Lankan government has meanwhile been busy destroying the war graves and other memorials for the 20,000 insurgents killed during the three-decade conflict.
One such cemetery has been turned into a playground; another in Jaffna was converted into an army camp.
And no-one knows what has happened to the records scrupulously kept by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), who are thought to have financially supported the bereaved families.
Suresh Premachandiran, an MP from northern Jaffna, says his party, the Tamil National Alliance, has tried in vain to stop the demolition of war cemeteries.
""Destroying graves is unacceptable,"" he said. ""Those people who were buried there are humans. They fought for the Tamil people.""
He continued: ""Recently when some Tamil civilians lit lamps to mark a Hindu festival in Kilinochchi, the local police thought they were trying to pay homage to the LTTE war dead and beat up them up.""
In the past, large numbers of Tamils visited these war graves. In many places, cultural programmes would also take place.
But now they're not sure what to do.
""Those who lost their relatives would like to remember them,"" says Selva, a resident of Colombo, who did not want his full name published.
""But if they do any kind of public display - like garlanding the photos of people in LTTE uniform, they will be arrested.""
Sri Lanka's deputy high commissioner in the UK, P M Amza, defended his government's decision to demolish war graves, labelling them a rebel propaganda tool.
""We consider the LTTE a terrorist organisation,"" he said. ""We feel all those associated with it form part of terrorism.
""There is no evidence to show the LTTE represented collective Tamil aspiration. They have killed many Tamil leaders.""
Human rights groups say both government forces and the rebels committed crimes against humanity during the conflict.
The LTTE were accused of recruiting children and firing at fleeing civilians during the final weeks of war.
It is an established fact that the LTTE killed thousands of Tamil youths who joined other armed groups in the early years of the rebellion.
But many Tamils who are outspoken about the government's alleged war crimes say little about the charges against the LTTE.
For many in the diaspora across the world, Heroes' Day is an opportunity to gather and reaffirm their loyalty to the Tamil Tigers.
Large gatherings are planned in Britain, Canada, Switzerland, France and Australia.
Sam Krishna, media co-ordinator of the British Tamil Forum, said: ""In addition to remembering those who sacrificed their lives for the Tamil cause, we will use the occasion to focus on the war crimes.
""We will once again press for an independent inquiry.""
Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, killed on the last day of the conflict in May 2009, traditionally marked Heroes' Day with a speech outlining his agenda for the year ahead, and the Tigers would stage a military parade.
But no organisation in Sri Lanka plans to commemorate 27 November this year. Some even say the time has come to move on.
A refugee who lives in the government-run camp in Vavuniya, in the north, said: ""War has ended last year, but still we are in the camps. We lost everything due to war. There's no point in talking about it.""
Some expat Tamils feel that overseas organisations behind the Heroes' Day commemorations would do better to use their resources helping those back home who are struggling to restart their lives.","Around the world, Sri Lanka's diaspora Tamils are meeting to mark Maveerar Naal (Heroes' Day) and remember those who died during the failed insurgency."

"But the mother-of-four, who received a devastating cancer diagnosis earlier this year, is actively preparing her young family for her death.
She is mother to Caileb, 13, Noah, nine, Brooke, eight, and Jesse, 15 months.
Mrs Lennox, from Cullybackey, County Antrim, has been thinking of creative ways for her children to feel close to her, long after she is gone.
She has made memory boxes for each of them and kept a journal for them to pore over.
Mrs Lennox was 34 and pregnant with her youngest child when she was told she had breast cancer.
Initial worries centred around the wellbeing of her unborn baby, who was born by emergency C-section at 30 weeks.
""He was a little sleeping beauty after all of my chemotherapy,"" she said.
""He was safe because I had a reduced dose of the treatment, but it was decided that he had to come out early.
""Little Jesse was 3lb when he was born and his lungs were underdeveloped, but he fought to full health.
""I completed my treatment and life returned to pretty much normal.""
But after fighting off the disease once, it was to return in January this year.
The cancer has now spread to Mrs Lennox's lungs, and her prognosis is not good.
""I am preparing to die,"" she told BBC News NI.
""It may sound morbid and I try not to make things too sad, but I believe it's important that the children know I won't be around forever.
""During my first round of treatment, I explained to them that I was sick and had to take medicine, but when it returned I knew I had to be more honest about the future.
""I've always been the type of mother who wants to protect her kids and to hide them from anything too upsetting.
""But now they know I won't be around to see them grown up and that I'm not going to get better.
""Obviously I was devastated when I got the news - it's not something any mother would want, but life can be taken away from you by cancer at any age.
""I don't have long left, but the kids get to go through some of the sadness they have ahead with me there to comfort them.""
As well as the memory boxes and leaving each child advice for the future, Mrs Lennox has been planning her funeral.
""I've sorted the grave, chosen my own coffin, written my eulogy and chosen the readings and hymns,"" she said.
""It's a strange experience, but my husband Alistair, 42, will have the four kids to look after when I'm gone, he doesn't need the stress of organising the funeral too.""
Mrs Lennox said she will make her final preparations in the coming days and then put it all to the side in order to spend the time she has left with her family.
""Christmas is my favourite time of year, so although I may not be there this year, we are going to make decorations together to hang around the house,"" she said.
Describing her situation now, she said: ""We've been humbled by the support we've received from friends, family and neighbours.
""I am happy, I am comfortable and I am content loving my family and my friends.
""I'm getting on with things as best I can and appreciating every day.""
Mrs Lennox has also urged any woman who notices any change in her body to get to the doctor straight away and to check themselves regularly for anything out of the ordinary.",Organising her own funeral is not something that 36-year-old Laura Lennox ever thought she would have to do.
"Speaking in Parliament, Mr Javid said he was ""wary of setting a precedent"".
Tata is looking to sell its loss-making UK business but the pension deficit is said to be hampering the process.
However pension experts warned earlier that the changes could take ministers down a ""dangerous path"".
Mr Javid has launched a consultation to consider the financial situation of Tata's UK pension scheme. He said the government was considering the proposals at the request of the trustees of the pension scheme and that any changes would need the approval of the regulator.
He stressed that several options were being considered.
""No decision has been made. We are wary of setting a precedent,"" he said.
""This is very much about this scheme and this scheme only, in very unique circumstances.""
How steel workers' pensions could be hit
One option under discussion is to base the scheme's annual increase on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation measure, which is usually below the Retail Prices Index (RPI) measure currently used.
This is the path favoured by the British Steel Pensions Scheme as they say it would leave most of the pension holders either better off or no worse off, compared with entering the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is the likely alternative.
The PPF is a pensions lifeboat, funded by companies, designed to protect pensioners if their scheme were to go under. However, steel workers would be worse off under it.
The company and the steel trade unions also welcomed the consultation, with the union saying that entering the PPF would be an ""unmitigated disaster"".
""We need to ensure that there are cast iron safeguards in place so this unique situation does not result in employers dodging their pensions responsibilities,"" the union added in a statement.
In total the British Steel pension scheme has 130,000 members. The scheme has a deficit of Â£485m.
Earlier, former Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb said: ""The government is going down a very dangerous path.
""Everyone has huge sympathy for steel workers and for efforts to protect jobs, but rushed changes to pension rules risk driving a coach and horses through the pension security of hundreds of thousands of workers well beyond the steel industry.""
Meanwhile the pensions expert Tom McPhail  from Hargreaves Lansdown said: ""The potential deal on British Steel could rip a hole in one of the most fundamental principles of pension provision. It is well-established that pension benefits, once granted cannot be taken away.""","Proposals to change Tata's pension scheme would be unique to the company and would not be applied more broadly, Business Secretary Sajid Javid has said."

"Speaking during a visit to communist Vietnam and talks with its leaders, Mr Obama said the move removed a ""lingering vestige of the Cold War"".
The US is trying to bolster its relationship with its Pacific allies, as China asserts territorial claims.
But Mr Obama said the embargo decision was not related to US policy on China.
""It's based on our desire to complete what has been a lengthy process of moving towards normalisation with Vietnam,"" he said in Hanoi.
Vietnam is one of several countries in the region involved in maritime disputes with China. The US insists on the right to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.
In 2014, a row over a Chinese oil rig near the Paracel islands led to clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels and anti-China riots in Vietnam.
Why Vietnam wants US weapons
Beijing's new South China Sea islands
High hopes for Obama visit
White House officials had indicated the arms ban, in force since 1984, would be lifted only if human rights in Vietnam improved.
""Sales will need to still meet strict requirements, including those related to human rights, but this change will ensure that Vietnam has access to the equipment it needs to defend itself,"" Mr Obama said after talks with President Tran Dai Quang.
Vietnam had been arguing for an end to the embargo, which was partially lifted in 2014.
President Obama's easing of all remaining restrictions on arms sales to Vietnam is powerfully symbolic. But what does it mean in practice?
Up to now, Vietnam has relied on Russia to supply most of its defence equipment, a legacy of the Cold War, when they were allies. The government would certainly like to diversify its sources, and is looking at a number of potential alternative suppliers. But it won't be rushing into the arms of US manufacturers just yet.
One reason is that a lot of US technology may be too sophisticated and expensive for Vietnam's needs. And while Vietnam's defence spending, which has doubled over the past decade, is driven by the rivalry with its giant neighbour China, it will not want to antagonise China by seeking state-of-the-art US weapons that might alter the military balance.
Another reason is the complicated process of procuring US weapons. In his announcement, Mr Obama said any military contracts would still be subject to provisos on human rights, and given the Vietnamese government's poor human rights record that might hold up possible arms sales in Congress.
The greatest potential for US sales probably lies in areas like military surveillance systems and coastal defence. Vietnam would welcome technology that helps it track Chinese naval forces. The partial lifting of the embargo two years ago was with the specific aim of improving US sales in this area, yet Vietnam is taking its time to decide what it most wants to buy.
Mr Obama's visit comes 41 years after the end of the Vietnam War in which the US sought to prevent a communist takeover of South Vietnam.
Several million Vietnamese - civilians, communist fighters and South Vietnamese soldiers - were killed, as well as more than 58,000 US soldiers.
By the end of the war in 1975, the communists had gained control of the entire country.
While in Vietnam, Mr Obama is expected to meet dissidents and make the case for Vietnam to remove obstacles to the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) free trade deal.
Amnesty International on Monday accused Vietnamese authorities of ""carrying out their repressive business as usual"" in arresting six activists.
""Before leaving Vietnam, President Obama must insist on the release of all prisoners of conscience,"" said its international advocacy director, T Kumar.
In a separate move, Vietnamese officials have removed the accreditation of the BBC's Jonathan Head in Hanoi after accusing him of conducting an unauthorised interview - something he denies.
The US president flies later to Japan for a summit of the G7 industrialised nations. His visit will include a tour of Hiroshima, where the world's first nuclear attack was carried out in 1945 by the US, killing at least 140,000 people.
The lifting of the US arms embargo ""will tighten the strategic pressure on China"", Vietnamese Communist Youth Union newspaper Tuoi Tre says on its website.
""It will also provide Vietnam with leverage in future arms deals with traditional weapons suppliers, particularly its long-time security patron, Russia,"" the paper says.
China's privately-owned portal Sina News sounds a note of alarm, saying that the lifting of the arms embargo ""is a cause for concern"" because it may have an impact on territorial disputes in the South China Sea.
A commentary (in Chinese) by Phoenix TV's news anchor Cheng Helin on Sina's ""Headlines Blog"" argues that Vietnam is being drawn into ""co-operation to contain China"" as part of ""a three-way alliance with the US and Japan"". But, says the author, the US is unlikely to sell Vietnam sophisticated weapons.

"It was back in the early 1980s that Mr Gardner, then aged 27, and his toddler son were homeless for a year in San Francisco.
Enrolled on a low-paid trainee scheme at a stock brokerage, he didn't have enough money to raise the deposit to rent an apartment.
So Mr Gardner, who was estranged from his partner, and Chris Jr would instead sleep wherever they could.
In addition to the toilet at a railway station, they'd bed down in parks, at a church shelter, or under his desk at work after everyone else had gone home.
They ate in soup kitchens, and what little money he had was spent on putting his son in day nursery so he could go to work.
Despite this adversity, Mr Gardner thrived in his job. A natural at selling stocks and shares, at the end of his training period his firm, Dean Witter Reynolds (DWR), made him a full employee.
Finally able to rent a home for himself and his son, his career then rapidly ascended into the stratosphere, and in 1987 he opened his own investment firm, Gardner Rich.
Today Mr Gardner, 62, is worth an estimated $60m (Â£48m), travels the world as a motivational speaker, and sponsors a number of homeless charities and organisations that combat violence against women.
Add the fact that Mr Gardner had a very troubled childhood, and served time in prison immediately before the internship at DWR, and you can understand why Hollywood came calling when he was writing his best-selling autobiography The Pursuit of Happyness (the misspelling is deliberate).
The movie of the same name was released in 2006, and Will Smith was nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Mr Gardner.
Looking back on his life, Mr Gardner tells the BBC that he ""wouldn't change anything"".
""I went through pain as a child so my children wouldn't have to,"" he says. ""I made a decision as a five-year-old boy that my kids will know who their father is.
""The rest of my destiny came forward because I made the right choices.""
Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Mr Gardner never knew his real father.
Instead he was brought up in poverty by his mother Bettye Jean and a physically abusive, alcoholic stepfather.
There was also a period spent in a foster home after his mother, in a fit of despair, tried to kill her partner.
Despite the woes of his childhood, Mr Gardner says his mum was an inspiration.
""I have one of those old-fashioned mothers who told me every single day, 'Son, you can do or be anything that you want to do or be.'
""And I believed it, I bought into it 100%.""
He adds that one day as a child he was watching  a college basketball game on TV when he commented that one of the players would make a million dollars.
""My mum said, 'Son, one day it will be you who'll make a million dollars.' Until she said those words the thought had never entered my mind.""
The million dollars didn't arrive immediately however, and after graduating from high school he spent four years in the US Navy.
After an honourable discharge in 1974 Mr Gardner moved to San Francisco where he started selling medical equipment.
His life then changed completely when he saw a man parking his red Ferrari one day, and Mr Gardner asked him what he did for a living.
The man was a stockbroker called Bob Bridges, and after the two got talking, Mr Gardner expressed an interest in joining the industry.
They met again, and Mr Bridges helped Mr Gardner secure an interview for an internship.
However, in the days before the interview at DWR Mr Gardner was arrested and jailed for non-payment of parking tickets.
He was ultimately able to make the interview, but only in the clothes he was wearing when he was arrested, which included trainers and a vest.
Despite the scruffy attire, his sense of drive and enthusiasm was enough to get him the job.
Six years after the release of the movie, Mr Gardner's life changed again in 2012 when his wife died from cancer aged just 55.
It made him re-evaluate what he wanted to do for a living, and after three highly successful decades in finance he decided on a complete career change.
""Some of the last conversations [my wife and I] had were her saying to me, 'Now that we can see how truly short life can be, what will you do with the rest of your life?'
""When you have that conversation, that changes everything. I've said that if you're not doing something that you're passionate about, you're compromising yourself every single day.""
So realising that he didn't want to work in investment banking any longer, he reinvented himself as a motivational speaker and author.
He now spends 200 days a year travelling the world speaking to packed audiences in more than 50 countries.
Scott Burns, a director at US investment firm Morningstar, says that Mr Gardner ""is just an amazing testament of fortitude"".
He adds: ""You can be down and out, but only as down as you let yourself be.""
Mr Gardner believes he disproves the theory that we are all products of our childhood environment.
""According to that school of thought I should have become another alcoholic, wife-beating, child-abusing, illiterate loser.""
Instead he says he made his own positive choices thanks to the love of his mother and support from other people.
""I chose light, from my mother, and from others with whom I don't share a single drop of blood, and I embraced it.""

Family and friends took part in a service of thanksgiving to celebrate Hobden's life in February, following a private family funeral.
Hobden's brother George told BBC Sussex: ""We've had such lovely support from not only all our family and friends, but the club here at Sussex. It's just been overwhelming how much support we've had and how much Matthew was loved.
""We always knew the support was there for Matthew. It's helped us immensely.
""We spent our whole childhoods playing cricket together and that's why today is an emotional day. It was always a dream for one of us to play for the club - we basically spent our whole childhood in the garden playing cricket together.
""I remember being down here as a 12-year-old kid and imagining if one of us did play here. Matthew did manage to do it. We were hoping that he was going to progress and play for England.

"Crewe raised the bar in front of their new manager David Artell, taking a first-half lead through skipper Ryan Lowe's ninth goal of the season.
Charlie Kirk should have done better when well placed on the left of the box early on, only to drag his finish past the far post, while Guthrie was also left to rue skying a close-range header over after getting on the end of a teasing free-kick from George Cooper.
Crewe took a deserved lead in the 28th minute when Lowe was slipped clear by Alex Kiwomya, the 38-year-old veteran finding the far corner as he scored in the league for the first time since also netting against Luton at Kenilworth Road in October.
But the impressive Marriott had Luton back on terms on the stroke of half-time, as the striker's shot from a tight angle managed to evade Garratt's clutches and slip in at the near post.
Nathan Jones' side looked to be up against it when they were reduced to 10 men eight minutes after the break after full-back Alan Sheehan caught Danny Hollands to earn his second booking.
But Crewe were undone when Marriott cut infield to force a save from Garratt and Danny Hylton kept the attack alive to pull the ball back from the by-line for Gray to sidefoot home the winner.

"The 26-year-old France forward had been heavily linked with Manchester United, and said last month there was a ""6/10"" chance he could move to Old Trafford this summer.
But he agreed to stay at Atletico after the club had a transfer ban upheld.
""The first thing I want to do is apologise to people who misunderstood my statements,"" Griezmann said.
""Since I have arrived, I have given everything for my club, my colleagues and my coaching staff.""
Atletico cannot sign anyone until January after failing in an appeal against a ban imposed in July 2016 for breaching Fifa rules over the signing of youth players.
Griezmann, capped 41 times, scored 26 goals in 2016-17 as Atletico finished third in La Liga behind Real Madrid and Barcelona.
He was named the third best player in the world, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in January.

For me, the most interesting piece of information about Antoine Griezmann's new contract is the release clause. The club have confirmed that it stays the same, at 100 m euros, that's around £88m.
So despite the fact that 2022 is printed on the contract, this feels very much like the Frenchman will give Atletico Madrid one more year before making the big money move we all expected him to make this summer.
For now though the Atletico fans will be delighted by Griezmann's loyalty. He said it would be a ""dirty move"" to leave the club in their hour of need and he has kept his word.","Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann has extended his contract by a year, with his new deal expiring in 2022."

In a joint letter, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, said the events surrounding the appointment raised questions about the Church's 2014 commitment to the consecration of women bishops.

Judy Murray has said the new sporting and housing development would deliver ""big"" for tennis and the community.
More than 1,000 objections have been lodged with the authority against the development on green belt land.
Jamie Murray was asked how he felt about his success and that of brother Andy.
He said: ""It is amazing what we've been able to do, being from a country with no history of tennis at all.
""It is quite amazing thinking about it and I get quite emotional talking about it.
""I think my mum especially has done some amazing things, and I hope for everything that she's done for us and for tennis in Scotland that she's able to get this tennis club built.
""We want to leave a legacy of what we're doing and it's the best way to do it. I hope the Scottish Government back her plans. I guess we'll probably find out in a few days I think.
Golfer Colin Montgomerie also supports the development, although he is no longer closely involved in the plans for the centre, which would be on land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.
The plan consists of a 12-court tennis venue, golfing facilities, a hotel and spa, and 19 luxury homes.
Stirling Council's planning and regulation panel rejected a planning application in December.
Planning officers said it should be refused because it was sited on greenbelt land.
They also said there was not enough affordable housing proposed and added the residential element was contrary to Scottish planning policy, because residents would have to travel for basic amenities and services.
On Wednesday Judy Murray told the hearing that she was keen to find a site suitable for a tennis centre in a ""central location"" of Scotland.
Ms Murray said: ""For me being a Dunblane person, when this site was mentioned to me it ticked all of the boxes.""
She added that it would ""deliver tennis on a big scale and serve the local area too"".
Ms Murray said the tennis facility would not be viable without the golf academy and housing.
""Tennis doesn't stack up by itself - it has to have other things around it,"" she said.
She told the public inquiry the Park of Keir development team involved her and property firm the King Group but there was no ""formal"" business partnership
Mark Ruskell, Scottish Green Party councillor for Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, previously spoke against the proposal.
Mr Ruskell said: ""It would have been totally wrong to rip up our democratically-agreed local plan to make room for executive housing on this treasured greenbelt area.
""For over 25 years, local communities have fought against development at Park of Keir. Judy Murray had a good idea but it was in completely the wrong location. I'm sure that sporting legacy can be secured elsewhere.""
The developers lodged an appeal with the Scottish government in March.
The hearing, by the Scottish government's planning and environmental appeals division, will continue to take evidence and hear from those objecting to the plan.",Jamie Murray has urged the Scottish government to back his mother Judy's plans for a tennis centre near Dunblane.

"Lawyers for the 15-year-old have also begun proceedings against Google and Twitter.
The lawsuit centres on publicity surrounding his arrest last month by police probing a major hack into the phone and broadband provider's website.
Details of the case emerged after some reporting restrictions were lifted.
The three newspapers defending the action - The Daily Telegraph, The Daily Mail and The Sun - all gave undertakings to protect the boy's identity pending the outcome of the case.
The judge at the High Court in Belfast also granted injunctions against Google and Twitter in a bid to remove any online references to the teenager's name and address, and images or information about his physical appearance.
The boy was among four people to be detained in connection with the TalkTalk hacking probe.
He was interviewed on suspicion of offences under the Computer Misuse Act before being released on bail.
Since then, his lawyers have issued writs claiming negligence, misuse of private information, defamation, breach of confidence and data protection.
As part of their action, they took legal steps to secure the removal of material published about the boy and where he lived.
The court heard that his family has had to move home after the publicity around his arrest.
It was claimed that he could be identified from newspaper articles and photographs that appeared at the time.
A barrister for the boy said the content contributed to his client being ""stigmatised"" within his community.
He said the teenager's name also featured in tweets and online searches.
During one of a number of hearings in the case, a lawyer for the Daily Mail rejected claims that it had revealed his identity.
She said the newspaper altered the boy's appearance and changed his hair colour in the photo it used.
She said his name and address had not been published, and added: ""It's our client's view that they did not identify the plaintiff.""
A temporary ban on reporting on the application for an injunction was imposed over fears that it could trigger further internet searches.
But after steps by Google and Twitter to remove the information, reporting restrictions were relaxed.

The council said it ""utterly refutes"" the accusation of racism.
Housing applications in the area had been judged acceptable against the borough's planning policies, drawn up following a statutory process including consultation, it said.
Caravans arrived on the Berkshire site on 24 April with the permission of the landowner, who is part of the gypsy community.
But the council has taken legal action because developments that have since taken place do not have planning consent.
It obtained the injunction to prevent further caravans and development on the Berkshire site, after its deadline to exit the site by Monday 27 April was ignored.

""It is located within the countryside where the council's policies seek to protect the rural character.""

"""All-lane running"" has been introduced between junction 10a for Wolverhampton and junction 13 for Stafford.
When trialled on the M25 near London, it ""reduced congestion and led to more reliable journeys"", said Highways England.
Lay-bys are replaced by emergency refuge areas - but some organisations say there are not enough of them.
The Central Motorway Police Group said the lack of lay-bys was ""cause for concern"" and there was ""minimal scrutiny"" of the scheme on the M6.
Edmund King, president of the AA said: ""Laybys are every two and half kilometres - that is about one and a half miles.
""If you can't see a lay-by you have to stop in a live lane of traffic and that is so dangerous.""
Matt Dallaway from the RAC said all-lane running as a concept was fine but he was concerned safety had not been tested.

"A roof will be placed on the tank, which will hold more than 60,000 cubic metres of gas.
The work is being done by the plant's owner Ineos to hold imported shale gas from the US, obtained through the controversial fracking process.
The development of unconventional gas extraction has been halted by a Scottish government moratorium.
Ineos announced plans last year to invest up to Â£640m in shale gas exploration in the UK and use it as a raw material for its chemicals plants.
The company hopes they will eventually be able to use gas that has been fracked locally in future rather than relying on stocks from the US.
The new storage tank is 56m (183ft) in diameter and 44m (144ft) high - 560 double decker buses could fit inside its 108,372 cubic metre interior.
The 330 tonne roof of the tank was lifted into place using a cushion of air similar to a hovercraft.
John McNally, chief executive of Ineos Olefins and Polymers UK, said it was a ""landmark day for Grangemouth"".
He said: ""We know that US ethane has transformed US manufacturing and now Scottish industry will benefit as well.
""This will secure a cost-effective supply of ethane for the next 15 years, and give a sustainable base for Grangemouth for that time.""

However, Friends of the Earth Scotland director Dr Richard Dixon said: ""We strongly suspect Ineos' plans for fracking in Scotland would result in blighted communities, with planning permissions sitting unused for years.
""The last thing anyone wants is to have a site next to their home where fracking may happen at some unspecified time in the future.
""Communities could have to wait until nearly 2030 to find out if they are going to be fracked or not.

"The ship docked at Catania, in Sicily, where the migrants will be handed over to the Italian authorities.
Bulwark, which has been on a search and rescue mission in the area for the past month, rescued the migrants on Sunday.
Captain Nick Cooke-Priest said the people traffickers were committing acts ""tantamount to murder"".
BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, who was on board Bulwark during the rescue, said a small, wooden vessel had been packed with about 400 people.
There also had been two rubber dinghies, each carrying about 100 people, trying to get to Europe from Libya.
""The fact that many didn't even have life jackets was another reminder that the gangs who trafficked them had little regard for their lives,"" he said.
He added that five of the men rescued were going to be questioned by Italian police about possible links to the smuggling gangs.
The BBC's Clive Myrie, who is in Catania, said it would take several hours to disembark all the migrants from HMS Bulwark.
""They are exhausted, some are traumatised and several are pregnant, so it is going to take a long time,"" he said.
""Once on dry land, they are taken to reception centres across the country but it could be years before they receive papers saying they can live and work freely in Italy.
""As for HMS Bulwark, in the early hours it will head out to sea on the lookout for more migrant boats.""
The ship's captain said Sunday was a ""complex"" day of seven search and rescue operations, and a ""huge success"".
""Normally we would be putting Royal Marines and sailors on to hostile shores,"" he told the BBC.
""The only difference with what we were doing yesterday was we weren't putting my own people into harm's way. We were actually taking survivors out of their harm's way and recovering them to HMS Bulwark.""
He added the traffickers who sent ""women, children, the old, young, pregnant out on a very perilous journey in unseaworthy vessels"" were a ""scourge"".

It was 1997 when 12-year-old Mark Baker began his campaign to safeguard the building's future.
Since then he and volunteers have saved sections and signed a lease to look after a large part of the grounds.
Gwrych Castle was built between 1812 and 1822 by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh as a memorial to his mother's ancestors, the Lloyds of Gwrych.

""I feel it is a tournament I can still do well in, said Rose. ""It's a course you can get to know and be competitive here for a long, long time.""

"This is the first time that a US head of state will be given this honour by India and reflects, more than anything else, the degree of comfort that Delhi has in its relations with Washington.
India, traditionally, has invited its Republic Day guests who will not attract controversy at home and come from countries with whom it has close strategic relations.
Thus the heads of neither Pakistan nor China have been invited on the first count. While no Latin American leaders have ever come for the second reason.
It says something about how difficult Indo-US relations have been that it has taken over seven decades for Delhi to invite the US president to participate in a ceremony marking its emergence as a full-fledged constitutional democracy.
While there is much focus on what diplomats call the ""deliverables"" - substantive agreements and deals - that will emerge from the meeting, the likelihood is that the symbolism will be much greater than the substance on this visit.
Mr Obama and Mr Modi held a fruitful summit in September last year and the present invitation was extended seemingly on the spur of the moment by Mr Modi when the two met on sidelines of the East Asia Summit in Myanmar (Burma) last November.
This has meant, officials on both sides admit, relatively little time to put together a substantial agenda.
A better measure of the Republic Day summit's agenda will be the areas the bilateral talks will focus on - defence, energy and counter-terrorism.
These are all in the sensitive zone of most governments and the depth of the discussion in each of these underlines how close the two countries have become.
In defence, the spearhead of the relationship is less the business of selling and buying arms than attempts by India and the US to jointly develop and produce a new generation of weaponry.
This idea has been kicked around for several years between the two countries, struggling to overcome political and bureaucratic resistance within both capitals.
The expectation is that at least one, if not more, such deals will be signed later this month.
A few dozen possible technologies and weapon systems have been offered by the US.
India is particularly interested in drones, carrier technology and so on that enhance its ability to project its air and naval power.
In energy, the two governments are looking at contending interests - improving the supply of fossil fuels and inhibiting climate change.
Mr Modi and Mr Obama are relatively unusual among world leaders in their personal belief that global warming is an issue of overriding importance.
The US has thus been a strong supporter - though with some commercial opportunities in mind - of the Indian government's ambitious plans for renewable energy, especially solar. The September Indo-US summit was shot through with green energy.
Mr Obama would like Mr Modi to give binding commitments on India's carbon emissions, even ones as broad as the ones China agreed to recently.
But India has a troubled fossil fuel dependent power generation sector. It is looking increasingly to the US for inexpensive natural gas - and has been pushing for a long-term commitment by Washington to allow such imports.
The US, in return, will continue to push India to change a flawed nuclear liability law that makes it difficult for the US and other countries to sell reactors to an energy-starved India.
Neither issue is likely to be resolved during this summit, though there may be discussion to that effect.
Counter-terrorism is a particularly good measure of the strength of relations for two reasons.
One, India continues to be wary of the degree of intelligence cooperation between the US to India's regional rival, Pakistan. The more Indian and US intelligence agencies work together, the less important the shadow of Pakistan becomes to bilateral relations.
By all accounts, India and US already enjoy a very high level of intelligence sharing on terrorism.
Notably, when European governments were complaining about revelations of widespread electronic surveillance by the US National Security Agency, a terrorism-wary India reportedly asked the NSA to step up its eavesdropping activities.
An area where the two sides are working more closely together, however, is cybersecurity.
An ever more connected India is becoming more conscious of its vulnerabilities in this area and understands the need for international support.
However, the spectacle that will accompany the Republic Day summit will obscure the weakness of shared big strategic thinking between the two countries.
The two leaders are extremely focused on domestic concerns, seeing foreign policy as a sideshow to the economic and social agenda they have for their own countries.
The two are on opposite sides when it comes to the US policies in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
But they are increasingly on the same page when it comes to East Asia and China.
When Mr Obama takes the salute of marching Indian soldiers, these will not be at the forefront of the summit agenda.

"Eilish Herron, of Paisley, was fuelling her Renault Clio at the forecourt in Linwood, at about 14:30 on Wednesday, when it was hit by a Ford Focus.
The 17-year-old died at the scene. The male Ford car driver was uninjured.
Eilish's former school, St Andrew's Academy, have also said she was ""very popular"" and ""a wonderful young adult"".
In a statement, Eilish's family said: ""We are absolutely devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter Eilish.
""We just cannot believe that we will not see her again. She was a lovely girl, a good daughter, sister, granddaughter and a great friend to those who knew her. She had so much to live for and we will miss her terribly.
""We are very gratefully for the thoughts and kind words already given, however, we would ask that we be allowed to have the time to grieve as a family at this very, very sad and difficult time.""
Kevin Henry, head teacher at Eilish's former school in Paisley, said: ""Eilish enjoyed six very successful and happy years in St Andrew's Academy and had left at the summer. She had been accepted to study nursing at Robert Gordon University.
""Eilish was a wonderful young adult and was very popular with both her peers and the staff of the school.
""She was a talented sportswoman and had been recognised in 2013 as Renfrewshire Young Sportsperson of the Year.""
Mr Henry said Eilish had given ""much of her own time to coaching younger students in the school"".
""Eilish was a great role model for our pupils, her death is a tragic loss,"" he said.
""Staff and the school chaplain will be available to students who require any support. Eilish and her family will be in the thoughts and prayers of all in the school.""
Meanwhile, police have asked anyone with information about the incident in which Eilish died to contact them.
A report on the circumstances will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.","The family of a Renfrewshire teenager who died after a collision between two cars at an Asda petrol station have said they are ""devastated"" by her loss."
"Don and Maxine Simpson from Bakersfield, California, died four hours apart on adjoining beds, holding hands during some of their final hours.
Melissa Sloan said her grandmother died first and when her body was removed from the room, her husband followed.
""All Don wanted was to be with his beautiful wife. He adored my grandmother, loved her to the end of the earth,"" she told KERO-TV.
He was 90 and she was 87, and they met at a bowling alley in Bakersfield in 1952, getting married in the same year.
When civil engineer Don worked for the US Army, the couple spent some time in Germany, where they adopted twin 18-month-old boys from an orphanage.
They returned to Bakersfield, where she worked as a nurse and he owned his own engineering firm.
They are survived by one son and five grandchildren.","Even in death, a couple married for nearly 62 years were inseparable."
"Clinton's book is a memoir, but it reads like a draft ""of a potential 2016 convention speech"", according to a Wall Street Journal reporter.
Regardless of the politics behind it, the memoir, which will appear on 10 June, is likely to do well. The publisher, Simon and Schuster, has printed a million copies. Here are some facts about the book.
One possibility was The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It Is Still All About My Hair, Clinton says, according to the New York Daily News' Lisa Marsh.
Clinton's struggle to come up with the right title shows that she is a conscientious writer - and has a sense of humour.
Perhaps even more important Clinton is thinking about her image, says Marsh, adding that on the book cover she looks like Tina Brown - ""tanned, rested, ready and with perfect highlights"".
In Clinton's case, Marsh argues, this means that she looks presidential.
In a video released on Facebook, she explains what she means by hard choices, saying that everyone faces difficult choices - and challenges - in their life, such as how to find a good job and then how to keep it.
In addition, she says, they face choices about education and ""whether to get married, whether to stay married"".
True - but the title she rejected sounds more fun.
The book is not for Washington insiders
It is written for the common man - or woman, she says.
""While my views and experiences will surely be scrutinised by followers of Washington's long-running soap opera  - who took what side, who opposed whom, who was up and who was down -  I didn't write this book for them,"" she says, according to Politico.
""I wrote it for Americans and people everywhere who are trying to make sense of this rapidly changing world of ours,"" she writes.
She says she is hoping to reach out to those ""who want to understand how leaders and nations can work together and why they sometimes collide, and how their decisions affect all our lives"".
But maybe not at first. Rather than disdaining Washington insiders, as she claims, she has catered to them, at least in the early stages. An advance copy of her book was sent to a consummate insider, journalist Mike Allen, according to NPR News.
On 9 June, the day before the book is available, she will do an interview with ABC News' Diane Sawyer. It is the first of many interviews and appearances that are designed to promote the book and Clinton's views.
That weekend she will sign books at Costco, a warehouse store and one of the nation's most important tastemakers.
Part of the book is personal. In an excerpt that appears in Vogue magazine, she writes about her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who grew up poor and started working as a housekeeper at age 14.
Much of the memoir, however, focuses on her work at the state department. It seems designed to appeal to potential voters, describing the work she has done in the government.
She has not declared her candidacy in the 2016 presidential campaign, but she seems on the verge of making it official.
Clinton is unlikely to devote much, if any, of the book to Monica Lewinsky.
As Clinton said in a recent interview, according to the New York Times, she has decided to ""move on"" and not dwell on the affair that her husband had with the former intern.
She has a huge fan base - and plenty of detractors. One of the most controversial parts of the book is likely to be a chapter entitled ""Benghazi: Under Attack"".
In this section she tries to defend her actions after the attack on the US mission in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 that killed Ambassador J Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.
She also lashes out at those who have criticised her.
""I will not be a part of a political slugfest on the backs of dead Americans. It's just plain wrong, and it's unworthy of our great country. Those who insist on politicizing the tragedy will have to do so without me,"" she says, according to a Politico writer.
Her detractors seem unfazed. They are planning to release an e-book, Failed Choices: A Critique of the Clinton State Department, that attacks her account.
More are likely to follow.","In Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton is coy about her marriage and other personal matters - but forthright about the role she played in Benghazi."
"Cleveland Potash, which runs the site near Saltburn, said the development would secure the plant for 40 years.
Plans include extending the mine to the east and upgrading facilities to increase production capacity.
Some groups have raised concerns the development could have an intrusive effect on the local area.
The company hopes to extend its planning permission with the North York Moors National Park Authority to 2063.
Cleveland Potash's parent company Israel Chemicals Ltd (ICL) is set to invest Â£300m in the area over the next five years.
As well as funding the development of the Boulby site, the investment will go towards upgrading the company's Teesport operation near Middlesbrough, which exports potash mined at Boulby.
One of the first steps will be the Â£16m replacement of the tower at the top of the Boulby site's rock shaft, which lifts the mineral up from the mine.
The renewal will raise the amount of ore lifted to around 5.3 million tonnes a year, a one million tonne increase on the current maximum.
The mine's underground equipment, which Cleveland Potash general manager Phil Baines described as ""aged"", will also be modernised.
Mr Baines said: ""Our present combination of potash resources and reserves totals around 70 million to 80 million tonnes, but following a major exploration programme we expect this figure will increase significantly over the new few years.
""Our plan is to extend operations out to the east in parallel to the area worked over the past 40 years, effectively providing a new mine for the next 40 years.""","Plans to extend a potash mine at Boulby in East Cleveland are expected to create more than 270 jobs by the end of 2015, the owners said."
"It is understood proposals for a £12m project at Fairy Glen would mean half an acre of wood is destroyed, Coed Cadw has claimed.
It has asked Snowdonia National Park Authority to reject RWE Innogy's plans.
The scheme would be capable of generating up to 13,000 megawatt hours of electricity each year, enough to supply around 2,700 households.
RWE Innogy revealed the plans three years ago and the authority has been carrying out a consultation.
It would involve getting water from the river above Penmachno bridge and diverting it through more than half a mile (1km) of pipeline around Fairy Glen, before returning it to the river near the River Lledr junction.
Rory Francis from Coed Cadw said: ""When woodlands such as this, which are centuries old, are lost they cannot be replaced.
""We urge the Snowdonia National Park planning committee to say no to the  proposal and for the company involved to think again.""
RWE Innogy said a consultation had taken place, and that the project had been designed to to minimise any environmental impact.
A spokesman said: ""Let's not forget that one of the biggest threats to the environment and wildlife is climate change itself, and so it is important that we are able to deliver projects like this which make an important contribution towards tackling climate change.""","Woodland in Conwy is ""under threat"" if a hydro-electric scheme goes ahead, a charity has said."

"The ITV2 show sees single men and women put together in a Majorcan villa to find love and win a Â£50,000 prize.
So far this series, there have been several instances of, shall we say, intimate behaviour taking place.
But broadcasting regulator Ofcom says it has actually received far more complaints about scenes that show the contestants smoking.
The series airs after the 21:00 watershed but has still attracted 46 complaints to date.
More than half of those - 24 - were from viewers objecting to the portrayal of smoking.
Fifteen of the complaints were made about the promotion of ""sexual material and promiscuity"".
The remaining complaints were for bad language, grievances about a racial slur and violence (for the time when a contestant threw a cushion ""aggressively"").
Ofcom has said it will assess the 46 complaints before deciding whether to investigate further.
The ITV2 show has a large following and an audience that includes pop singer Adele.
Speaking at the second of her Wembley dates last week, she labelled one of the contestants a ""tramp"" for taking part in a show in which ""real people have real sex on real TV"".

"On Wednesday she was endorsed by John Warner, a five-time Virginia senator.
She was also backed by the Arizona Republic newspaper, the first time it has supported a Democrat since its founding in 1890.
Meanwhile Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, says Monday's debate has led to record fundraising for his campaign.
Speaking on Tuesday night at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, Mr Trump said that $18m (Â£13.8m) had been raised in the day since the debate was held.
The Trump campaign is planning to increase advertising spending before the election, and is reportedly considering asking the candidate to make his largest personal financial contribution yet towards it.
In other campaign developments:
Senator Warner represented Virginia in the Senate for five terms between 1979 and 2009. He also served as Secretary of the Navy and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Speaking alongside Tim Kaine, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Mr Warner said that he was ""distressed"" by Mr Trump's words, and that the Republican nominee does not have respect for the military.
This is the first time he has endorsed a Democrat for president.
Other Republicans to have supported Mrs Clinton include Larry Pressler, a former governor and senator from South Dakota, and former Minnesota governor Arne Carlson.
Wednesday's endorsement by the Arizona Republic's editorial board is the latest from a typically Republican-leaning newspaper.
She has already been endorsed by the conservative-leaning newspapers such as the Dallas Morning News, the the Houston Chronicle, and the Cincinnati Enquirer.
""Since The Arizona Republic began publication in 1890, we have never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president. Never. This reflects a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and Republican principles. This year is different. The 2016 Republican candidate is not conservative and he is not qualified,"" the editorial in the Republic, the state's largest, says.

"Jeff Varner, who is appearing on Survivor: Game Changers, made the revelation about his team-mate Zeke Smith on Wednesday's episode.
Varner told the show's presenter and his team-mates: ""There is deception here,"" before turning to Smith and asking: ""Why haven't you told anyone that you're transgender?""
He has since apologised on Twitter.
Several other contestants quickly defended Smith after Varner's comments, telling the former news anchor his actions were ""so wrong"" and that he ""didn't have to do that"".
Smith had previously shared his history with Varner privately but had not intended to reveal he was trans on the show.
In an article for The Hollywood Reporter published after the episode aired, Smith criticised Varner and said he was ""not wild about [viewers] knowing that I'm trans"".
He wrote: ""In calling me deceptive, Varner invoked one of the most odious stereotypes of transgender people, a stereotype that is often used as an excuse for violence and even murder.
""Varner is saying that I'm not really a man and that simply living as my authentic self is a nefarious trick.
""In reality, by being Zeke the dude, I am being my most honest self - as is every other transgender person going about their daily lives.""
Smith added that he doesn't believe Varner, who is gay, did it because he hates trans people, and praised his Survivor team-mates for the way they reacted.
""I think he hoped others would believe that trans people are fraudulent. What's great is that nobody bought it.
""It's important people see he lost that fight. The message should be clear that hate will always lose.""
In a Twitter message posted after the show aired, Varner offered his ""deepest most heart-felt apologies to Zeke Smith"".
He wrote: ""I was wrong and make no excuses for it. I own responsibility in what is the worst decision of my life.""

"Taylor, 31, the first Kiwi double centurion against Australia, reached 290 before he was the last man to fall.
His score surpassed that of England's Tip Foster, who scored 287 against Australia in Sydney in 1903.
New Zealand made 624, their first 600 against Australia, but the hosts added 258-2 to lead by 193 with one day left.
Resuming on 235 in Perth, Taylor made the third-highest score by a New Zealand batsman. Brendon McCullum got a triple century against India in Wellington last year.
Taylor batted for nine and a half hours, facing 374 balls and hitting 43 boundaries before he was caught at deep square-leg by substitute fielder Jonny Wells.
That denied him becoming only the second batsman to score a triple century against Australia, after England's Len Hutton, who made 364 at The Oval in 1938.
It was New Zealand's fifth-highest Test team total, the record being set as recently as last year with 690 against Pakistan in Sharjah.
Having begun day four on 510-6 at the Waca, New Zealand were soon reduced to 587-9 before last man Trent Boult helped Taylor guide them past 600 and a first-innings lead of 65.
Australia lost Joe Burns for a duck in the third over but Steve Smith hit his fourth hundred as captain in only his fifth Test in charge. He shared an unbroken partnership of 212 in 55 overs with Adam Voges (101) who became the sixth centurion of the match.
Taylor celebrated both his century and double century on day three by sticking his tongue out in a message to his daughter.
He added he was ""undercooked"" going into the first Test, which New Zealand lost, after he was sidelined for six weeks by an injury to his testicles sustained in the nets in Zimbabwe in August.
""I felt I just needed to get back in the groove,"" Taylor said.
""You can either graft it out or go out and play your shots and the latter probably comes more natural to me.

"Galit Nakash is to take a DNA test to determine if the girl is her biological daughter, following a court hearing.
If the results are negative, authorities say they will return the child to Sri Lanka straight away.
Ms Nakash was stopped when airport officials found she had used another child's passport to leave Sri Lanka.
She says she gave birth at a hospital in Sri Lanka during a business trip but that her visa application for the baby, named Tahel, was turned down.
On Tuesday a court in Tel Aviv accepted her request to undergo a DNA test in Israel.
Ms Nakash's lawyer, Matan Hodorov, said his client and the one-year-old child are being moved to a facility at Ayalon prison in Ramle until the results of the test are known on Friday.
Mr Hodorov said Ms Nakash, 49, turned down an Israeli request to take a DNA test while she was in Sri Lanka because she did not trust the process there.
He said when Ms Nakash, who runs an export business and comes from Tel Aviv, re-entered Israel, the passport she used for Tahel carried the name of a different child.
However he said he was ""confident the DNA test will prove Galit is the mother [of Tahel].
""We have all the correct medical documents from the hospital in Sri Lanka where she was born,"" he told the BBC.
The Israeli foreign ministry said Ms Nakash was denied a visa for Tahel because officials had doubts about her story.
""There were a few indications which raised a certain amount of suspicion,"" spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said. ""That is why we did not allow the child and Galit to enter the State of Israel.
""It doesn't mean she is wrong but we have a legal duty to check it out. If the DNA tests show she's the mother then that's wonderful and the problem is over. If not, the child will immediately be sent back to where she came from, as required under the Hague Convention [on child abduction],"" Mr Nahshon said.

"The National Enquirer and RadarOnline reported a 35-minute recording, apparently of the actor, making threats about former porn star Scottine Ross.
Ms Ross has taken legal action against Sheen, claiming he physically abused her and had sex with her without disclosing his HIV positive status.
Sheen has not commented on the reports.
Earlier this week, police officers served a search warrant on the New York headquarters of American Media Inc, the parent company of both RadarOnline and the Enquirer.
According to the warrant, the Los Angeles police investigation was triggered when Ms Ross made a complaint on 31 March saying she feared for her life after reading the reports.
On Thursday, the publications - neither of which have published the audio alleged to contain the star saying he would like to see a former fiancee ""have her head kicked in"" - refused to hand over the material to police.
Dylan Howard, the Enquirer's editor-in-chief and editorial director of RadarOnline, told Reuters the outlets had no plans to turn over documents or identify their sources.
He said the search warrant, signed by an LA County Superior Court judge, was illegal under both state and federal law preventing the use of such warrants against media organisations relating to ""newsworthy"" information.
He said: ""We do believe that a judge did issue this order against the law, and that's why we will not be complying with its order.""
In a televised interview in November 2015, Sheen said he had been diagnosed with HIV four years earlier.
The former star of Two and Half Men and films including Wall Street and Platoon admitted his history of drink and drug abuse was a ""bad decision"" but said it was ""impossible"" he would have passed HIV on to anyone else.

""If that offer, unfortunately, is so incredibly good for Matty but not very good for Bristol Rovers Football Club, we'd probably have to decline matching it.
""Because, if you're so lopsided, it can de-stabalise the rest of the squad because somebody's on an amount of money.

Hamer also revealed the club would discuss a new contract with manager Darrell Clarke at the end of the season, with Rovers guaranteed at least a play-off spot, lying one point off the top three ahead of Saturday's visit of relegated Dagenham & Redbridge.
""At the moment, we're not distracting him (Clarke) from the job in hand,"" Hamer said.
""As soon as that's over, we'll sit down and have a chat with him. There's no reason why we can't come up with something that's going to please him and please us.

"Mr Johnson, 57, told the Mirror on Friday that the club paid him £50,000 to keep quiet about allegations of sexual abuse by a former chief scout.
In a statement, Chelsea said Mr Johnson had ""suffered unacceptably"".
The club said a review into the case would take place, adding it had ""no desire to hide any historic abuse"".
It said the review would examine whether it had carried out a proper investigation when the allegations first came to light and why it did not report them to the Football Association and Premier League.
""We are fully committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of all children and young people who are in our care or attending our premises.
""Their welfare is of paramount importance,"" the club said.
Mr Johnson was a member of Chelsea's first team from 1978 to 1981.
He joined the club as an 11-year-old in 1970 and told the Mirror he had been groomed from the age of 13 by scout Eddie Heath.
Mr Heath, who was the club's chief scout from 1968 to 1979, died before the allegations against him were made.
According to the Mirror, Mr Johnson signed a confidentiality agreement in 2015 and accepted £50,000 from the club, but they did not accept blame.
Chelsea said in its statement that when the settlement was reached the club's board understood it was ""usual practice"" to include a mutual confidentiality agreement, adding that Mr Johnson's solicitors had not objected to the clause.
""More recently, against the current backdrop of wider revelations and other victims coming forward bravely to tell their story, we no longer felt it appropriate to keep the confidentiality agreement in place. It was therefore removed,"" the club said.
The club said the decision to have a confidentiality clause had received ""significant scrutiny"" and it had now asked an external law firm to review this decision and make recommendations for settling claims in the future.
""In advance of that, however, the board would like to make clear that, in light of what we know now about the wide-scale abuse in football clubs in the 1970s and 1980s, it now believes that the use of such a clause, while understandable, was inappropriate in this instance.
""We certainly have no desire to hide any historic abuse we uncover from view. Quite the opposite.""
Chelsea said Mr Johnson's solicitors at the time claimed Heath had ""inappropriate relationships"" with other young boys and men from the club, but no names were given.
The club said with the ""limited information"" it received it had been unable to identify any further individuals who may have been subject to abuse.
It comes after former Chelsea midfielder Alan Hudson said on Facebook that it was ""common knowledge that Mr Heath was a danger to us youngsters"".
Chelsea added it was now a ""very different club"" to the one it was in the 1970s.
It said its safeguarding policies were robust and continually reviewed and audited by the Premier League.
Meanwhile, an ex-Southampton FC employee who has been accused of abusing young boys at the club in the 1980s is still working in football, the BBC understands.
The man, who has not been named for legal reasons, is understood to have left Southampton after concerns were raised about his behaviour - but is now employed by another football club.

Yorkshireman Sykes, who cut the gap on Rea to 26 points with Saturday's win, moved in front on the first lap.
However, he was quickly replaced by Rea before skidding off and ending his hopes of victory.
Sykes was able to continue but from the back of the field and he moved through to take four points.
Rea was never threatened as he secured a much-needed 25 points after failing to finish the last two races.

"Speaking from Canada, his wife Ensaf Haidar told the BBC she feared his punishment would start again on Friday.
Badawi was arrested in 2012 for ""insulting Islam through electronic channels"".
Saudi authorities sent his case for review amidst global protests, after the first round of lashes in January.
For four years Badawi ran the Liberal Saudi Network, which encouraged online debate on religious and political issues.
Ms Haidar said she had held high hopes that her husband was about to be released, but he remained less optimistic.
When they last spoke three days ago he told her not to expect him home in the near future.
She called on the countries and rights groups that had campaigned for her husband's release to mobilise once more.
Badawi received his first 50 lashes in January, but subsequent floggings have been postponed.
A shaky video taken on a mobile phone showed Badawi being lashed by a member of the security forces.
The footage prompted international protests which were repeated every Friday, the scheduled day for the beatings.
In March, the kingdom expressed ""surprise and dismay"" at international criticism over the punishment.
At the time, the foreign ministry issued a statement saying it rejected interference in its internal affairs.
It is not clear why Badawi has not yet endured a second round though a medical report found he was not fit for the punishment.
Saudi Arabia enforces a strict version of Islamic law and does not tolerate political dissent. It has some of the highest social media usage rates in the region, and has cracked down on domestic online criticism.","Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court has upheld the sentence of 1,000 lashes and 10 years of imprisonment on blogger Raif Badawi, despite a foreign outcry."

"The first half was a tame affair with little for the 1,842 fans to get excited about.
Queen's looked the most threatening but could not find an opening.
And Cairney found the only goal of the game, picking up the ball on the edge of the box and rifling a low shot into the back of the net.
The first real piece of action was for the visitors and their front man Stephen Dobbie. He won the ball from Peter Murphy, but he dragged his shot wide of the target.
Minutes later Mark Millar tried his luck for Queens, but his shot was saved by the legs of Greg Fleming in the Ayr goal.
The next clear cut chance came just before the half time whistle. Jordan Marshall slipped away from his marker, he whipped in a great ball from the left, but Dobbie couldn't get his head to it.
The breakthrough came in the second half with Cairney's goal, and Ayr could have doubled their lead through Gary Harkins.
The striker had time, but failed to get the shot on target and launched the ball over the bar.

"The woman - a 45-year-old mother of two - was convicted in August along with an unmarried Sri Lankan man.
She was sentenced to death by stoning, while the man was sentenced to 100 lashes.
Saudi Arabia's decision to stone the woman was condemned in Sri Lanka, where protests were held.
Sri Lankan embassy officials visited the woman in a Saudi jail on Sunday, Deputy Foreign Minister Harsha de Silva said.
The country had appealed to Saudi Arabia's government to pardon the couple.
""Through our intervention, they have agreed to reopen the case,"" Mr de Silva said.
""This is a big victory. We will provide her with legal help.""
Deputy minister Ranjan Ramanayake added that the Sri Lankan government was informed about the woman's case only after she had been convicted in August 2015 - despite the fact she was arrested in April 2014.
""Islamic Sharia law says four respected Muslims need to be eyewitnesses for this type of case, but this has not been possible in this case,"" he said.
""Unfortunately, not knowing the law, she has confessed under pressure without any legal help.""
Protests were held outside the UN compound and the Saudi embassy in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo - with some calling for a ban on sending Sri Lankan workers to Saudi Arabia.

"Prop Jenkins will set a world record for a front-row forward when he leads Wales against Argentina in Cardiff.
The 35-year-old is making his 133rd Test appearance - still 15 behind Richie McCaw's 148 - but McBryde believes he could break the record.
""He's in a good position and I can't think of a reason why he can't,"" said the Wales forwards coach.
""All he has to do is keep himself fit - bearing in mind he's at the age the body is the first thing that breaks down.""
Jenkins is playing his 128th game for Wales and has also made five Test appearances for the British and Irish Lions.
It takes him past former New Zealand hooker Keven Mealamu as the most-capped front-row forward and into fourth place in the all-time list which is led by All Blacks legend McCaw.
Jenkins has retained the captaincy despite the return of regular skipper Sam Warburton from injury and 14 years after making his debut for Wales.
Speaking to Welsh language broadcasters, McBryde praised Jenkins' skill and professionalism.
""His worth has been proven time after time with his defensive work and his fitness across the field,"" he said.
""He understands the wide game better than most of the backs and his greatest strength is what he brings to the team as an experienced voice.
""Over the years he has overcome a lot of injuries and that's a testament to how professional he has been.
""He's kept himself going through those injuries and he's dealt with the many changes there have been in the scrum and he's come through every test that's been asked of him.
""He's been one of the heroes of the national team and hopefully against Argentina we'll see a performance that proves that.""","Wales captain Gethin Jenkins could become rugby's most capped player if he keeps himself fit, says Robin McBryde."
"The Trust is bidding to take over the League Two club from owner Les Scadding.
And it now has £236,000 following a fund-raising campaign that included a share issue to fans.
A supporters group statement read: ""What an achievement and one the Trust Board are truly humbled by.""
The trust took interim control of the Rodney Parade-based club in August.
Their millionaire backer Scadding backed the move in which the club's board stood down.
Newport had already announced major shareholder Scadding was gifting his holding to the Trust.
Interim chairman Tony Pring told BBC Radio Wales: ""People seem to think that Les sort of gets a chunk of that money and basically that money now goes into the club and becomes a working capital.
""Les, with several other people, have loans on the club that must be paid - they're club loans [and] they will be budgeted for… with monthly repayments.
""But the £236,000 actually basically goes into the club's bank account for working capital for running the club this season.""
The prospective new owners say they will strive to ensure The Exiles live within their means to support manager Terry Butcher.
""This is possible. We need to be prudent in our spending, driving down our cost base and increasing our revenue through a number of channels,"" added the statement.
The Football League must approve the takeover, but Trust members expect that to be a formality.
""Now the hard work really starts,"" added the statement.
""No one should underestimate the challenge ahead.
""The club has been in a difficult place and it is going to take some time before it gets to where we would like it to be.
""That said, we are confident we can achieve this with the plans we have.""

"Retirement is an ever receding distant dream - probably just as well, as the pension is probably more likely to cover a week in Southend rather than a grand world tour.
Then there's the always present danger that if your manager isn't replaced by a machine, you may well be.
But that's not the whole picture - technology can be the great leveller, a transformational entity that could alter society and the future workplace for the better.
So which is it - shiny tech-driven utopia, or something more reminiscent of Bladerunner?
To round off a month looking at the future of work, I spoke to several experts who have contributed to technology of business over the past few years and found out if they had changed their view of the future.
I'm not sure my vision of the future of work has changed much per se, not in a visible way at least.
My hope remains that technology will increasingly afford greater freedom in where, when and how we work.
But, I think that the biggest change that is yet to come lies with how companies address the cultural and organisational challenges. These must be overcome, in order for the incredible opportunities that are offered by transformational technologies to be able to take effect.
The success of the future of work will come down to one thing. People.
It will be the extent to which the people are engaged with the ""purpose"" of their organisation that will dictate the success or failure of that organisation in the future.
Engaged employees embrace change, they look for growth and learning in all they do and best of all they unleash the full potential of new technology.
They do this by using it to find new ways of working rather than simply making the old ways of working happen a bit quicker.
In ten years' time, I hope we will have broken free of many of the physical ties of our current working world.
I hope that employees, engaged and empowered with the purpose of their organisation, will use the incredible advances offered by new forms of interaction, like holograms and displays that offer ""high empathy presence"" where more of our body language can be conveyed to enable us to collaborate more effectively wherever we are.
It would be foolish to think that any of this would replace the pleasure or efficiency of being there face to face.
But ultimately it provides a greater degree of choice and a greater range of people with whom we can connect and collaborate to deliver a better outcome for ourselves and our organisations.
To an extent, we should be worried about [being replaced by machines], as being worried should mean that we take the opportunity of the rising power and automation of the machines seriously and seek to use it to ensure a better outcome for our society.
But we should never be thinking in terms of humans versus machines, and rather of humans plus machines.
Our future has always relied on our ability to use the potential of technology to lift our human capabilities.
Only failure awaits those who use the technology to replace what we are capable of - ask any driver who has blindly followed GPS directions only to find themselves confronted with too low a bridge or too narrow a street.
For millennia, advances in technology have disrupted our society. Such changes are always difficult to live through, but ultimately, if managed properly and used responsibly, they will ensure our society is in a better place for generations to come.
I've been actively studying the future of work since 2008, when we first launched the Future of Work Consortium that has brought together executives from more than 60 companies to talk about this crucial issue.
Over the last few years I have become increasingly focused on two factors that shape work - technology and demography.
On the technology front the development of AI and robots has happened - as Moore predicated- at an exponential rate and every week sees new developments.
I chaired a session at Davos this year that brought learning, AI and neuroscience experts together. What was clear is that there is a growing awareness that technological developments will both augment some work, and replace others - and I think we are clear that this is happening at speed.
We can add to this the demographic reality of long lives. For the last couple of years my colleague the economist Andrew Scott and I have been studying what it means when the many (rather than the few) live to 100.
Looking forward we see profound changes in the structure of careers and the way that people plan both tangible and intangibles assets.
However, whilst some events have moved very fast over the last three years - there are others that have not.
Despite the availability of on-line education, very few of those who start a course actually complete it.
And whilst we talk about the globalisation of innovation, a glance at the current patent landscape of the world shows that most innovative activity is still taking place in the northern hemisphere in clusters in the USA, Europe, Japan, Korea and emerging in China.
In Africa, South America, much of Asia and Australia there are still very few clusters of highly skilled people. I wonder if in the next ten years the world will fulfil the promise of the globalisation of talent and innovation.
The new world of work has become an aspiration that can be realised, with benefits for both the company and the individual.
Businesses no longer have to lease obese property which is rarely efficiently used (over half the desks are typically empty on any one day) and can provide workspace aligned to the real work that needs to be done.
For the employee, more flexibility and freedom allow a better work/life balance and the ability to stagger commuting.
As technology advances, with new portable devices and the 'cloud', we will see a redistribution of work. It will move from central business districts to a poly-centric city where people work more locally, in new co-working spaces that provide a sense of community and challenge the corporate office, which will get slimmer and be used for different activities.
Algorithms may soon be our managers, as big data and decisions are best made by machine and no longer man.
Our roles will need to be creative, and so yes as the predictions suggest, many jobs will vanish as automation arrives.
Those that are left will be more interesting and fulfilling - and the workspace will accommodate knowledge work and not the process driven tasks of today.","For the workers of today, the future can look bleak."

"Kevin McKearney and his elderly uncle Jack McKearney were shot at their family shop in County Tyrone in 1992 by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).
Their family has welcomed the report by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET).
The HET found no evidence of security force collusion but also said it could not allay the family's suspicions.
The report has identified eight areas of concern about the security force operation, both in the lead up to and the aftermath of the murders.
The McKearney family were well-known in Republican circles and felt they were particularly vulnerable to attack.
Days before the murders, Kevin's mother Maura had received a telephone call threatening that three men ""in white coats"" would be killed in Moy Square.
The family, several of whom wore white coats while working at the butchers shop they owned in the centre of the County Tyrone village, reported the call to police through a local councillor.
The HET report has concluded that the RUC ""did not formally record or investigate the reported death threat"".
It stated that the McKearney family were given no police advice about their personal security after they were threatened.
The inquiries team also said that the loss of forensic material during the RUC investigation, and the ""fact that a special branch officer was aware of the getaway car three minutes after the murders"" remained unexplained.
Kevin McKearney, a father of four, was working behind the counter of the butcher shop on 3 January 1992 when a gunman walked in a shot him several times.
The 32 year old died at the scene.
His 68-year-old uncle John McKearney - known as Jack - was shot and seriously wounded in the attack.
He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries three months later on 4 April 1992.
The murders took place two weeks after a Protestant man was shot dead by Republican paramilitaries at his family's shop in the same village.
Robin Farmer, the 19-year-old son of a policeman, was murdered on 21 December 1991 by the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA).
The HET report stated Mr Farmer's murder had ""raised fears among the Catholic community in Moy of a retaliatory attack because of the history of tit-for-tat sectarian murders in mid-Ulster throughout the Troubles"".
Mrs McKearney received the death threat from anonymous caller just six days after the teenager was killed.
The butcher shop murders were not the first time the Troubles had affected the McKearney family.
Three of Kevin's brothers had joined the IRA.
In May 1974, his older brother Sean McKearney died when a bomb he was planting at a petrol station outside Dungannon exploded prematurely
In May 1987, his brother Patrick McKearney was one of eight IRA men killed by the SAS when they tried to attack Loughall police station in County Armagh.
Last year, a HET report into that incident concluded that the IRA opened fire first.
A third brother, Tommy McKearney, was jailed for his involvement in the killing of a part-time UDR soldier in 1976.
Tommy McKearney spent 53 days on hunger strike in the Maze Prison, and now works as an author and freelance journalist.
At the time of Kevin's death, his parents insisted that he had no paramilitary links.
He had worked at the butchers shop since leaving school.
Among its conclusions, the HET report stated: ""Kevin and Jack were not members of any paramilitary groups. They were both completely innocent victims.""
The HET is a specialist police team set up in 2005 to re-examine 3,269 murders which took place during the Troubles.",A new report into the murders of two men shot by loyalist paramiltaries 20 years ago has concluded the RUC did not do enough to prevent their murders.

"This is the principle that all websites and apps should be equally accessible.
Travel portal Cleartrip.com and media giant Times Group both announced they would be withdrawing from the service, citing competition fears.
But Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg defended Internet.org's aims.
The service aims to extend internet services to the developing world by offering a selection of apps and websites free to consumers.
Telecoms firms absorb the data costs associated with handling Internet.org traffic.
But many companies fear this distorts the market and makes it harder for small companies to get their products seen by the public.
Currently, Indian visitors to Internet.org can access nearly 40 stripped-down services, including job, healthcare, news and education sites.
Times Group blogged that it was appealing ""to all publishers to jointly withdraw from Internet.org"" and said that the Times of India newspaper would also withdraw ""if its direct competitors - India Today, NDTV, IBNLive, NewsHunt, and [the] BBC - also pull out"".
The BBC has yet to respond to the call.
A Times Group spokesman said: ""We support net neutrality because it creates a fair, level playing field for all companies - big and small - to produce the best service and offer it to consumers.
""We will lead the drive towards a neutral internet, but we need our fellow publishers and content providers to do so as well, so that the playing field continues to be level.""
Cleartrip said the debate around net neutrality had given it ""pause to rethink"" its approach to Internet.org.

""He pointed at him, then he pointed again and then the jaw opened. He's was kind of star-struck for the rest of the game.
""I think it was a fantastic day, we're going to have some great memories to take away from it.""
All the young footballers have a passion for the sport and the team has been set up with the help of the Foyle Down's Syndrome Trust.
It provides a wide range of activities for young people and adults with the condition.
Despite McClean's big match experience, Mr Morrison told the BBC that his young side gave the forward a good run for his money.
""He [McLean] had a fantastic attitude and they loved him for it,"" he said.
""The lads had a ball and James was an absolute gentleman, we couldn't believe our luck.""
The team had initially tried to find a squad with similar abilities, but with no success.
After this week, the Bulls are now being offered potential tournaments against the likes of Manchester City, Everton and Liverpool.
""You have no idea the offers we've had, it's been crazy,"" Mr Morrison said.
""My phone is nearly melting. I've had hundreds of messages from mainstream football clubs right across the island, right over to England.
""[Northern Ireland winger] Paddy McCourt came down to help in training on Sunday as well, so it has been an amazing week and the boys have really responded to it.
""They've taken to it like ducks to water and I think we could have serious footballers on our hands before long,"" he added.",Republic of Ireland footballer James McClean has surprised a team of children with Down's syndrome following a social media appeal.
"Tommy Thompson was arrested on a criminal contempt warrant for evading a civil case brought by his investors.
They accuse him of cheating them out of promised proceeds from one of the biggest shipwreck hauls in US history.
In 1988 Thompson recovered millions of dollars' worth of gold from a ship that sank off the US coast in 1857.
Thompson went missing in 2012 amid demands he appear in court. He and an associate, Alison Antekeier, were arrested in January in Boca Raton, Florida.
They had been at the hotel for two years, paying cash for their room under a false name and using taxis and public transport to avoid detection.
The Columbus Dispatch reports that Thompson's plea deal with prosecutors requires him to turn over $425,380 (Â£286,000) to the court, money that was seized when he was arrested.
Under the deal, Thompson will be sent to prison for no more than two years, but in exchange the government will not charge him with other offences arising from the case.
A total of 161 investors had given Mr Thompson $12.7m (Â£8m) to find the ship on the understanding they would see returns on their investment.
Thompson, then an oceanic engineer at Battelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, and his crew brought up thousands of bars and coins in 1988, much of them later sold to a gold marketing group in 2000 for about $50 million.
But the criminal complaint unveiled in January said the gold bars and coins he recovered from the seafloor were worth up to $400m (Â£260m).
One of the investors has asked an Ohio state judge to freeze all of Thompson's assets.",A US treasure hunter - who spent years evading authorities - will go to prison rather than testify about gold he discovered in a historic shipwreck.
"This is a major problem in a globalised economy, where rewards go to the most highly-skilled and most productive workers, and where there is more importance than ever attached to high-quality education.
But how do we measure the quality of education in Latin America against global standards if there is an unwillingness to take part in international tests? How can would-be reformers compare results across international borders?
Among the most widely recognised international comparisons are the Pisa tests - the Programme for International Student Assessment - conducted every three years by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
In Latin America, the regional rankings of these international tests taken by 15 year olds in maths, reading and science, are headed by diminutive Chile, ahead of economic powerhouses like Brazil and Mexico.
But most countries remain off the ranking completely.
Part of the reluctance for many Latin American countries might be a fear of being compared with world leaders in education like Finland and Japan.
Even Chile, the highest ranking country in the region, is considerably below the global average for these tests, with the average in the Pisa tests being countries such as the UK and France.
But the Pisa exam has also generated significant controversy over its methodology and design, leading to concerns - common to many standardised tests - that it does not adequately measure the quality of instruction. Or that it does not truly capture the diversity of contexts facing such different school systems.
These concerns are reflected in the fact that fewer than half of Latin American countries currently participate.
But there are other tests that can provide a global scale for measurement. Unesco's Third Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (TERCE) covers a much larger part of the region.
This has evaluated 15 countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia, as well as smaller participants such as Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala, the Dominican Republic and Uruguay.
The assessment also has a broader range than Pisa, looking at children at different stages of development (at the ages of eight and 11), and evaluating the context of each school.
What TERCE found was reason for cautious optimism - but also renewed effort. Its comparison between its last evaluation in 2006 and today showed a modest but broad improvement in test results across the majority of Latin American countries.
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
These rankings were also headed by Chile, followed by Costa Rica and Uruguay. But they also allowed a comparison with countries missing from the Pisa tests, such as Guatemala and Paraguay, which appear in the lower half of the TERCE test scores.
But despite - or even because of - the surrounding controversy, these tests have already served an important purpose.
Whatever their flaws, they have brought attention to the fact that the massive expansion of access to education in the region, a major victory in itself, isn't sufficient without an equal improvement in quality.
No longer can policymakers ignore the reality that even Latin America's best performing countries, much less its average ones, are far behind the developed world, and far behind where they need to be to compete in the global economy.
A student from Honduras or Paraguay is competing for jobs with graduates in Singapore and South Korea.
As a result, demand for better education is swelling from the bottom up, as individual students, parents, and civil society groups are gaining greater awareness of how their schools stack up to international standards.
The international comparisons have also imparted a necessary lesson - that increased investment alone cannot solve education problems.
Latin America's education systems spend nearly as much as the OECD average, with some spending as much as 6% of GDP, while producing lacklustre results.
More funding is in some cases necessary, but without a rigorous and targeted approach to ensure that it is spent well, the extra money may just be wasted.
That's why a new conversation is needed in Latin America, one that focuses on innovative ways to improve quality - and quickly.
A wave of new participants - social entrepreneurs, private businesses, investment funds, foundations, and advocacy groups - are taking the lead in introducing new pedagogies, new technologies, and structural reforms in their education systems.
And projects like Pisa and TERCE are helping to put these issues front and centre on the public policy agenda.
The next generation of students has little time to lose.
Gabriel Sanchez Zinny is author of EducaciÃ³n 3.0: The Struggle for Talent in Latin America",There have been concerns that the quality of education has been stagnant in too many countries across Latin America.
"At a meeting in Australia, it was agreed that around 1.5 million sq km of a part of the Southern Ocean would be protected from companies wanting to fish there for the next 35 years.
The Ross Sea actually only makes up about 2% of this ocean, but it is home to a huge amount of wildlife.
Environmental campaigners have welcomed the decision saying it will help to protect Earth's cleanest area of ocean.
They hope it will be the first of many such zones across the world.
You will find around two in every five of the world's Adelie penguins here, around one in three Antarctic petrels and around one in 16 of the world's minke whales. Killer whales live there too.
It is also a rich source of krill, which is food for seals and whales, so it's very important that it is looked after.
Here are 10 things you probably didn't know about Antarctica...
Antarctica isn't a country - it's a whole continent!
It is sits at the Earth's south pole and is almost completely covered by an massive ice sheet that is thousands of metres thick.
Antarctica is absolutely enormous. It is almost 14 million sq km, which makes it the fifth-largest continent behind Asia, North America, South America and Africa.
This is about 58 times the size of the UK and twice the size of Australia!
It is also the world's highest continent, with an average land height of 2,300 m.
The temperature on Antarctica has been known to go as low as around âˆ’90Â°C.
Because it is so cold, the air cannot hold as much moisture so it does not rain very much at all there.
This actually means Antarctica is considered to be a desert, but the other deserts that you know are much warmer...!
The winds can always blow as strongly as up to 351 km per hour.
As it is such an important place for scientific research, at any one time there may be many hundreds scientists spread across the various research stations all over the continent.
You will also find tourists there. According to Discovering Antarctica, in the early 1990s, about 5,000 tourists went every year. By 2009-2010, the continent welcomed around 37,000 visitors.
But nobody lives there permanently!
In the winter, the sea around Antarctica freezes over creating what is called sea ice. This makes the continent almost twice as big in winter.
The end of the summer in Antarctica is in March and the end of the winter is in September - opposite to in the UK!
This is because Antarctica is in the Southern Hemisphere, which faces the Sun during our winter time.
In 1959, several countries signed an agreement called the Antarctic Treaty, saying that Antarctica would be a peaceful place that they would work together to look after.
Without an international agreement like this, people would be free to do what they wanted there. However, this meant countries now work together to protect it.","Officials from 24 countries and the European Union have agreed that the Ross Sea, in Antarctica, will become the world's largest marine protected area."
"Police in Nyala, the capital of South Darfur state, fired tear gas at protesters throwing stones and burning tyres in the streets, witnesses said.
Several protesters chanted slogans calling for the government's downfall.
Since June, Sudan has seen sporadic protests against government austerity measures, including fuel subsidy cuts.
The country's authorities have been trying to cut spending since Sudan lost three-quarters of its oil revenue when South Sudan seceded last year.
Demonstrators in Nyala chanted ""No to high prices"" and ""People want to change the regime"", according to witnesses.
Bothina Mohmed Ahmed, a spokeswoman for the state of South Darfur, said it was not known how the six deaths had happened, and that an investigation had been launched.
Opposition activists and media accused the police of using live ammunition.
The protests started on Monday when local students ""rejected the price of transport announced by the government"", Ms Ahmed said, adding that ""other groups"" had joined the protests and attacked government buildings.
""This has been happening on the main roads and in the main market area. There's been some damage to buildings,"" African Union-UN peacekeeping mission spokesman Christopher Cycmanick told AFP.
The anti-austerity protests in Sudan began in June among students in Khartoum, but have since spread to other social groups and areas.
They had recently dwindled as a result of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began on 20 July.
Until this year, Sudan had escaped the unrest characteristic of recent uprisings in Arab countries such as neighbouring Egypt, but correspondents say economic hardship caused by austerity has led to growing dissatisfaction with President Omar al-Bashir.","Six people have been killed in violent protests against high transport prices in the Darfur region of western Sudan, local officials say."
"Souness, who won 54 caps for his country, said the current squad is not up to the standard of his day.
""Going back to my generation we had players in all the big teams in England and winning trophies in England,"" Souness told BBC Sportsound.
""We now have a group that's maybe short of that level.""
Scotland lost both games in their Euro 2016 qualifying September double header to Georgia and world champions Germany, which leaves them sitting in fourth place Group D.
""I think the manager deserves great credit for what he's doing with a limited group of players,"" said Souness.
""I don't want to be harsh on the players because I know when you're a Scotland player you go out and give it your lot.
""The manager deserves great credit for gelling them and getting the very most from a group that are limited. That's all you can do as a manager.
""He's got what he's got and he's doing a very good job of it as far as I'm concerned.""
Scotland's final two qualifiers next month see them host Poland at Hampden before travelling to face Gibraltar.
The best they can place in the group now is third place which would secure a spot in a two-legged play-off.
However, it is not entirely in their own hands, with a number of permutations needed in other games in the group involving Germany, Poland and the Republic of Ireland.
Souness admitted: ""It's never great if you're relying on other people.""","Gordon Strachan is doing as best as he can with the talent at his disposal, according to former Scotland captain Graeme Souness."

"The four-time champion has been at the team since 2015 and has helped build them up to be title contenders this year after a difficult few seasons.
Vettel is leading the championship by 14 points from Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton with nine races remaining.
The move ends speculation that the 30-year-old could be considering a move to Mercedes in the near future.
A statement from Ferrari said the team had ""extended its technical and racing agreement"" with Vettel ""for the 2018, 2019 and 2020 racing seasons of the F1 world championship"".
In Ferrari's time-honoured style, the statement contained no quotes or further information from the driver or the team.
Ferrari announced earlier this week they had retained Vettel's team-mate Kimi Raikkonen for one more season.
Vettel had made it clear his preference was for the Finn to stay.
Vettel's decision is likely to be followed by confirmation from Mercedes that they will retain Valtteri Bottas for at least another season alongside Hamilton.
The Finn was signed on a one-year deal to replace world champion Nico when after the German retired from F1 after winning the title last year.
Hamilton is contracted to Mercedes until the end of 2018.
Later, after qualifying second to title rival Lewis Hamilton's Mercedes, Vettel said: ""I love this team and the people who work for this brand,"" adding: ""In a way, it was a no-brainer to continue. We haven't yet achieved what we wanted to achieve. But things are looking pretty good and obviously we have a long road ahead of us.""
Asked whether he had talks with Mercedes over the summer, he said: ""I have been around in the paddock for a while so I know people and it's only natural you talk, but it has never been more than chatting,"" he said. ""I have been talking for a while with Ferrari. My intention was to stay.""
Mercedes F1 boss Toto Wolff said: ""There were zero discussions with Sebastian about a contract.""
Vettel added that he had signed the deal at this weekend's Belgian Grand Prix and talked of the inspiration he has following in the footsteps of his childhood hero Michael Schumacher.
""We haven't succeeded. The mission is still ongoing. I want to win in red. We talked about inspiration earlier, about Michael, who was mostly dressed in red, he won most of his races and championships in red.
""I don't want to step in his footsteps. The whole generation of the Ferrari team today was to leave their own footsteps but certainly there is a huge inspiration. Something that for me is now the biggest challenge and dream I have. It's what I want to achieve.""",Sebastian Vettel has signed a new contract to stay with Ferrari until the end of 2020.
"The former van driver sold 214,000 copies of his single Something I Need, which was originally recorded by US pop band OneRepublic.
His nearest rivals were Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars, whose song Uptown Funk dropped one place to number two.
Shortly after it was announced, Haenow thanked his fans on Twitter, saying: ""You guys are amazing!""
Speaking about his chart success he said: ""It's an incredible end to my year. I'm absolutely shocked, I can't believe it.
""I'm gonna go and have a few good drinks with my mates - definitely more than a few good drinks - to celebrate.""
The top-selling album in the run-up to Christmas was Ed Sheeran's X, which shifted more than 214,000 copies last week - the most it has sold in a seven-day period.
X - pronounced ""multiply"" - was already the UK's biggest-selling album of the year, excluding compilations.
The singles chart also saw a high entry for novelty act The Wealdstone Raider.
The 48-year-old, whose real name is Gordon Hill, became famous when he was discreetly recorded at a football match, pint in hand, shouting ""you've got no fans"" to opponents of his football club, Wealdstone FC.
After being uploaded to YouTube, the video went viral, amassing more than eight million views.
His single, called Got No Fans, is raising money for Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital, Autism Concern and Wealdstone Raiders Youth FC.
It entered the chart at number five.
For the first time, streaming data counted towards the Christmas chart, benefitting acts like Mariah Carey and The Pogues, whose seasonal standards climbed back up the top 40.
Carey's All I Want For Christmas Is You reached number 18, while The Pogues' Fairytale of New York - boosted by download sales - reached number 11.
But the biggest beneficiary of the new chart rules was Ronson, who broke the all-time record for the most streamed track in a single week.
Uptown Funk was listened to almost 2.34 million times last week, smashing Sheeran's previous record of 1.72 million streams, set in November.
Band Aid 30, at one point considered to be a strong contender to top the Christmas charts, ended up in 17th place.","X Factor winner Ben Haenow has won the race for the Christmas number one, the Official Charts Company has announced."

The result means Liverpool will top the table at Christmas - ahead of the Gunners on goal difference - as two teams with title pretensions of their own produced a spectacle almost devoid of entertainment and quality.
Frank Lampard came closest to breaking the deadlock when he hit the woodwork in the first half, while Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud wasted two good opportunities late on to claim the win that would have seen the Gunners leapfrog Liverpool.
""Credit has to go to Blues boss Jose Mourinho for getting his tactics spot on. Chelsea crowded the midfield, had a solid defence and looked dangerous on the counter-attack. Mourinho came for a point and got one.""
How Mourinho's tactics keep Chelsea in title race
Instead, referee Mike Dean's final whistle produced a chorus of boos and chants of ""boring boring Chelsea"" from Arsenal fans frustrated at their team's failure to lay a glove on Jose Mourinho's team.
There were some moments to debate in a match that was a niggly, messy affair played out in dreadful conditions, although arguably the biggest news of the night came further up the Seven Sisters Road where Tottenham named Tim Sherwood as Andre Villas-Boas's full-time successor.
John Mikel Obi could easily have seen a red card for a shocking first-half challenge on Mikel Arteta that went unpunished by referee Dean and Arsenal were convinced they should have had a penalty when Theo Walcott tumbled after Willian stepped on his foot just before the interval.
An undistinguished first half finally burst into life when Lampard found space on the end of Eden Hazard's clever flicked pass but saw his powerful effort bounce off the underside of the bar to safety.
The second half, if it was actually possible, opened in even more scrappy fashion and Arteta was the victim of another poor challenge from Ramires, which finally persuaded Dean to show Chelsea's midfielder a yellow card.
Mourinho made his first change with 17 minutes left, somewhat surprisingly choosing to replace Hazard with Andre Schurrle, who was soon followed into the action by Oscar, on for fellow Brazilian Willian.
Jose Mourinho is now unbeaten against Arsenal in all 10 competitive matches as Chelsea manager (all against Wenger), winning five, with five draws.
As a tortuous evening entered its final 10 minutes, Arsenal finally created a chance when Aaron Ramsey found Giroud with time and space but he sent a hopeless angled finish into the side-netting.
The France striker was then played in again at the near post by Kieran Gibbs but he was blocked by a combination of Chelsea keeper Petr Cech and his defenders.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger declined to make any changes when the game appeared to be crying out for the invention of Spanish playmaker Santi Cazorla - resulting in a draw that was unfulfilling for both teams.

"The decree, or fatwa, was passed on Sunday by a group of clerics.
It said that according to Islam transgender people with ""visible signs"" of being male or female may marry someone of the opposite sex.
But those with ""visible signs of both genders"" may not marry, it said.
The 50 clerics, part of the little-known Tanzeem Ittehad-i-Ummat body based in Lahore, also said any act intended to ""humiliate, insult or tease"" transgender individuals should be considered a crime under Islam.
The fatwa is not legally binding in any way.
""We are glad that somebody's talked about us too,"" transgender rights worker Almas Bobby told BBC Urdu. ""By Sharia we already had the right [to marry], but unless measures are taken to remove the misconceptions about us in society, the condition of our community will not be changed.""
Another social worker for gender issues told BBC Urdu that it was a ""good step"", but that issues would remain until transgender marriage was officially legitimised.
Qamar Nasim said that many police officers had charged people in transgender marriages because ""due to a lack of knowledge... they consider it same-sex marriage"".
""This practice can only be stopped when [the] government spread awareness about rights of a transgender person.""
Transgender people are discriminated against in Pakistan and struggle to find employment.
More than 45 transgender people have been killed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the past two years, according to local rights group Trans Action.
Last month, a 23-year-old transgender activist died after delays in treatment. Alisha, who was shot eight times, was in critical condition when admitted to hospital but staff could not decide whether to put her in a male or female ward, according to her friends.
Trans Action, an advocacy group, say that there are at least 45,000 transgender people in the province and at least half-a-million nationwide.
In 2012, Pakistan's Supreme Court declared equal rights for transgender citizens, including the right to inherit property and assets. They were also given the right to vote the year before.
However, it has denied homosexual couples the permission to marry, with cases in the past of male homosexuals being charged under anti-sodomy laws.","A religious decree declaring transgender marriage to be legal has been cautiously welcomed in Pakistan, but activists say attitudes still need to change."
"A statement from his publicist said the entertainer had been diagnosed with ""an incurable brain tumour"", and thanked well-wishers for their support.
Middlesbrough-born Daniels, whose career has spanned nearly four decades, found fame in the 1980s with his BBC TV series The Paul Daniels Magic Show.
His wife, Debbie McGee, tweeted: ""With great sadness.""
Mark Linsey, acting director of BBC Television, said: ""We're sorry to hear this sad news and our thoughts are with Paul and his family.""
Daniels, whose real name is Newton Edward Daniels, developed his magic skills in working men's clubs.
He made his TV debut on talent series Opportunity Knocks in 1970, and came second.
He was then given a regular slot on ITV variety show The Wheeltappers And Shunters Social Club, hosted by the late comedian Bernard Manning.
He made the move to the BBC in 1979 and launched The Paul Daniels Magic Show, which ran for 15 years.
He became one of the biggest stars on British TV, becoming known for a string of catchphrases, including the line: ""You'll like this... not a lot, but you'll like it.""
He said he had first used the line at a club in Yorkshire as a way of dealing with a heckler.
Daniels and his wife, a fellow performer and his on-stage assistant, married in 1988.
As well as numerous appearances on magic shows, Daniels has presented game shows including Wipeout and Odd One Out.
He appeared as a contestant on the BBC's Strictly Come Dancing in 2010, and was the second person to be voted off in the series.
In a 2014 interview, McGee explained how, having left the Iranian national ballet where she was a soloist, she was initially unenthusiastic about working with a magician.
But she said she was converted after seeing Daniels on quiz show Blankety Blank.
""He was very funny - he took his jacket off and had a Superman T-shirt on and red knickers over his trousers. I was in hysterics.
""He still makes me laugh, all day long, even when I want to be angry,"" she said.
In recent years, the couple has toured regularly with a magic and comedy show, but a planned appearance at the Leicester Comedy Festival two days ago was cancelled at short notice, as was another date in Nottingham the following night.
Daniels' manager said all his future shows had been cancelled.
A statement said: ""We can confirm that one of our greatest magicians and entertainers of all times, Paul Daniels, has sadly been diagnosed with an incurable brain tumour.
""On behalf of Paul, Debbie and their families, we thank you for your kind concerns and support at this sad time and ask that their privacy continues to be respected. There will be no further comments at this time.""
Illusionist Dynamo, whose real name is Steven Frayne, wrote on his Instagram account: ""Just read this sad news! Sending my love and respect to Paul, Debbie and all the family! #MagicLegend"".
A tweet was also published on the official Dick and Dom page of children's entertainment presenters Richard McCourt and Dominic Wood, saying: ""Heartbreaking news of my true hero @ThePaulDaniels. You inspired and encouraged me to do the job I still do today. Sending strength and love.""","Magician and entertainer Paul Daniels, 77, has been diagnosed with terminal cancer, his family has said."
"The figure is a big increase on the  89 child abductions reported by Unicef last month.
Their latest statement blamed a militia group allied to the government.
South Sudan is in a state of civil war with forces loyal to President Salva Kiir pitted against rebels led by former Vice-President Riek Machar.
The campaign group Human Rights Watch has accused both sides of using child soldiers.
Unicef said the boys were abducted by the Shilluk Militia, under the control of Johnson Oloni. The government has previously said it has no control over the group.
""We fear [the children] are going from the classroom to the front line,"" said Unicef's representative in South Sudan, Jonathan Veitch.
Witnesses report seeing children as young as 12 carrying guns, according to the UN.
The seizure of the boys happened in an area known as Wau Shilluk, in oil-rich Upper Nile state.
The UN believes 12,000 children were used as child soldiers across South Sudan last year.
About 1.5 million people have been displaced by the fighting in the country and 2.5 million are facing severe food shortages.","Hundreds of boys in South Sudan have been kidnapped and forced to become child soldiers, the United Nations children's agency says."
"The bank has previously said that a ""significant percent"" of its London workforce would be moved if Brexit became a reality.
The bank employs around 5,000 staff at its offices in London.
Earlier, the Lloyds of London insurance market said that after Brexit some of its business would move to the EU.
""We currently employ more than 5,000 people in London, and probably 20% to 30% of our workforce could be affected,"" the UBS chief executive, Sergio Ermotti, told the Japanese business newspaper Nikkei.
""We believe that London will continue to be an important financial centre, although maybe not as important as it is today,"" he added.
The UK voted narrowly to leave the EU in the Brexit referendum in June.
Since then the government and many UK businesses have been grappling both with the process of negotiating the divorce - which has not yet been formally triggered - and the eventual economic, social and political consequences of such a move.
Mr Ermotti said that it was too early for the bank to take any decision about moving its operations from London, but it was ""well prepared"" for any outcome of the impending Brexit negotiations.","The Swiss banking group UBS says that up to 1,500 of its jobs in London may be moved abroad once the UK leaves the European Union."

""I'd like to thank ITV, Simon [Cowell], The X Factor family and particularly the viewers, all of whom have been a big part of my life for so long.""
The 41-year-old took over from Kate Thornton in 2007 as host of the popular talent show.

""I'd like to wish the team all the best for the future, especially whoever takes over from me,"" O'Leary continued.
""You're about to be the conductor on the most brilliant, runaway train in showbiz. Good luck you'll love it!""
The news of his departure may fuel speculation that O'Leary is a contender to replace Jeremy Clarkson on the BBC's Top Gear.
Before Friday's announcement, William Hill had O'Leary as 6-1 to take over following the BBC's decision not to renew Clarkson's contract earlier this week.
Before The X Factor, O'Leary hosted Big Brother's Little Brother, Channel 4's companion show to its long-running reality show.
He has presented on BBC Radio 2 since 2004 and has hosted the National Television Awards since 2010.
Bookmakers Ladbrokes have made singer Olly Murs, a former X Factor runner-up, favourite to take over the vacant presenting role.

"Net profit for the year to the end of March rose 66% to €867m (£614m; $948m), slightly ahead of analysts' expectations.
The airline's ""Always Getting Better"" customer experience programme had attracted ""millions of new customers to Ryanair"", chief executive Michael O'Leary said.
Falling oil prices also led to a lower fuel bill.
""Our AGB programme is transforming our customer experience, our service, and the way we listen and respond to our customers,"" Mr O'Leary said.
""We have won substantial traffic and share gains in all markets.""
Passenger traffic was up 11% to 90.6 million customers, while total revenue rose 12% to more than €5.6bn.
To cope with rising demand, Ryanair said it had ordered 183 Boeing 737-800 planes for delivery from 2014-18, and 200 Boeing 737 Max 200s from 2019-2023.
The new aircraft will be cheaper to finance and operate, with engines 18% more efficient than their predecessors, the company said.
Much of the growth in passenger numbers is being driven by its new Business Plus and Family Extra services, it added.
Who'd have thought it. Being nicer to customers has given Ryanair a big jump in profits, a big jump in passengers and much fuller planes.
By ""being nicer"" I don't just mean being more friendly. As one analyst told me, it's more concrete than that. They've got a better website. An app. They're not as draconian about their luggage rules, and you can pay more to secure a seat next to your family/friends etc.
Even by their standards, the double-digit rise in passenger numbers is big. And Ryanair has ambitious expansion plans too. With hundreds of new planes on order, they want to double the number of passengers within a decade or so.
Ryanair owns 29.8% of rival Irish airline, Aer Lingus, and has tried unsuccessfully to take over the firm in the past.
But Aer Lingus is now a takeover target for International Airlines Group (IAG), which owns British Airways and Iberia.
In February, the Irish government, which owns 25% of Aer Lingus, said it could not yet approve a £1bn offer from IAG for the carrier, because it wanted more clarity on guaranteeing jobs and more information on IAG's transatlantic plans.
Aer Lingus, however, has welcomed IAG's offer.
For its part, Ryanair said: ""The Board of Ryanair will consider any offer (should we receive one) from IAG on its merits, if or when it is received.""

"The European Union has approved significant changes to data laws, aimed at putting individuals back in charge of their information.
It is the biggest shake-up to privacy regulation for 20 years, according to experts.
The changes would make privacy ""a board-level issue"", one lawyer said.
Peter Church, a technology lawyer at Linklaters, said it would make businesses ""start taking these issues a lot more seriously"".
US technology companies already have an uneasy relationship with European regulators, with both Google and Facebook facing big fines - Facebook over its use of cookies and Google over its privacy policy.
Although this new law will not come into force until 2018, the changes meant the tech giants would have to ""pay more attention to what regulators are saying"", said Mr Church.
The new draft policy, in discussion since 2012, will need to be ratified by the European Parliament next year.
Other changes include:
Jan Philipp Albrech, chief negotiator, said of deal: ""This would be a major step forward for consumer protection and competition and ensure Europe has data protection rules that are fit for purpose in the digital age.""
Stewart Room, head of data privacy at PwC, said: ""The scale and breadth of the EU's changes to privacy rules will deliver unprecedented challenges for business and every entity that holds of uses European personal data both inside and outside the EU.
""Most companies will be shocked at the scale of the new rules and the work that needs to be done before the laws take effect in two years - it is not much time for the magnitude of the internal changes that will be required.""",Technology companies could face fines of up to 4% of their global annual turnover under new European rules on data protection.
"Lloyds Banking Group said the faults were not caused by any external upgrade work or cyber attack.
Many customers found their debit cards were declined and about 3,500 ATMs were not working for three hours.
The technical fault has now been fixed, and the banking group has apologised to those affected.
The hardware failure came on a normal day for the banking group, it said.
""We were in 'business as usual' mode - and there was no maintenance or update activity on the system at the time,"" said a spokeswoman for Lloyds.

This is not the first bank to suffer from a computer failure, and it certainly won't be the last.
New technology will put even more strain on the banks' creaking IT systems, which were built to run a very different banking system decades ago.
So how do we cope as consumers?
The irony is that the more we embrace the digital wallet, the more emergency cash we may need to carry for when these systems crash.
""We are working with our suppliers to understand what caused the hardware failure, but there is no evidence that it was as a result of an external intervention or attack on our systems.
""We continually review and update our systems as necessary and make significant investment to do this.""
The chief executive of TSB, Paul Pester, said on Sunday that its customers' debit card transactions had been affected after problems with two out of seven IT servers.
He tweeted an apology and replied to some comments personally.
Lloyds Banking Group serves about 30 million customers and is the largest retail banking group in the UK. TSB has about five million UK customers and is in the process of being split from Lloyds Banking Group.
The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog, said it had been in contact with Lloyds and would be updated on how customers had been affected.
Not everyone who tried to use their cards suffered problems, and Lloyds said that online customers were unaffected.
UK banks have suffered a series of IT problems over the past few years. In December, an estimated 750,000 customers at the Royal Bank of Scotland group were unable to use their credit and debit cards for several hours.
Leanne Seaward, 29, from Verwood in Dorset, said she discovered she had problems when she went to pay for her weekly supermarket shop at about 16.15 GMT on Sunday.
""It was a little embarrassing, I put my card in and it kept saying transaction void. I thought it was because I am in the process of switching banks, so assumed they might have closed my account without telling me.
""Luckily I had my husband with me so he was able to pay, but if I was getting petrol and on my own it could have been a completely different matter.""
Your experiences
A week later, NatWest - which is part of the group - said that it was hit by a cyber attack. A deliberate attempt to disrupt services by creating a surge in traffic - known as a distributed denial of service attack - meant some customers struggled to access online banking.
In 2012, a major IT failure locked many RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank customers out of their accounts for several days. The issue was particularly bad for Ulster Bank, with customers facing access problems for weeks.
Most banks have seen online and card failures in recent years, with many of the computer systems being used dating back decades.
TechUK, a trade body for a number of technology companies, said: ""It is now widely acknowledged that the technology infrastructure across many financial institutions is exceptionally complex, to the point where it no longer serves many banks, it hinders them.
""However many financial institutions are unable to address these issues because of the sheer cost and disruption that replacing these systems would entail.""","A hardware failure was the cause of the shutdown of some Halifax, Lloyds, Bank of Scotland and TSB cash machines and debit cards on Sunday."

There is also raspberry jam tagged ""anabolic"" in reference to steroids also banned in sports.
""Not everyone realised this was a humorous present from RT,"" the broadcaster said. It has consistently denied and ridiculed allegations of a state-sponsored doping programme in Russia.
One of the gift boxes was sent to Yulia Efimova, who won two swimming silver medals at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
A photo posted on Russia's leading social networking website VKontakte shows a smiling Efimova with test tubes and vials apparently containing food, such as jam, honey and condiments.
On its website, RT gave further details of its gift pack which it suggested had also been sent to other people.

Nottinghamshire County Council said an Enforcement Notice to clear the site by 1 September had been served.
According to people living nearby, much of the waste had been stored in large plastic bundles but these had been opened when fires started.
Jonathan Smith, from the council, confirmed they had served the notice in April.
He said: ""This activity has been done without planning permission and without the prior knowledge of the county council.
""An enforcement notice requiring the removal of all waste from the site and restoration to its former condition has been served on the landowners and other parties who we believe have an interest in the site.""

"William Smith wrote the account of the Siege of Ladysmith from 1899 to 1900.

""I occasionally look at them as I move house and I thought these are very precious.""

"Campaigners have for years complained that the data claimed by manufacturers was a fantasy.
Now, critics have concrete evidence of the lengths that one of the world's biggest carmakers was prepared to go to hide the truth about its diesel vehicles.
That VW's bid to scam the system was revealed in the US, where the diesel car market is very small, underlines that country's more robust approach, says Greg Archer, manager at the international campaign group Transport & Environment.
""They've got a much better system. In Europe, we do not test the right cars in the right way,"" he says. ""In Europe, the cars tested are pre-production models that are specially prepared for the purpose. The industry calls them 'golden vehicles'.""
Europe's tests are governed by the New European Driving Cycle. Despite being called ""new"" the NEDC was developed in the 1970s, and got its last major revision in 1996.
Cars are hooked up to measuring equipment, and go through acceleration and deceleration tests to measure carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, fuel efficiency, and so on.
Tests are carried out by independent organisations or at manufacturers' own facilities. Either way, the intention is to create a standardised, controlled environment, where temperatures, tyre pressures, fluid levels, braking, and much else can be monitored.
The process is overseen by government-appointed inspectors, who in the UK come from the Vehicle Certification Agency (VCA), to ensure there's no corner-cutting. However, the VCA website says it will only ""witness some tests being carried out"".
The aim is to replicate driving conditions in a busy European city. And this is where the critics cry foul.
Such tests, they argue, replicate little of real-world driving, which is why so many studies have queried manufacturers' emissions data.
For instance, according to a report published earlier this month by the UK Committee on Climate Change, between 2002 and 2014 the gap between official and real-world CO2 emissions for new passenger cars increased from about 10% to 35%.
Europe's NEDC test involves putting cars through two cycles, one lasting about 13 minutes at an average speed of 12mph, and a second cycle lasting almost seven minutes at an average of 39mph.
For Jane Thomas, from Emissions Analytics, one of the leading independent emissions analysts, the NEDC tests are ""very sedate and short. There is no resemblance to real-world driving"".
The gentle acceleration, cruising speed, and braking used in the tests would be unrecognisable to most drivers, she says.
There is no simulation of prolonged motorway driving, and carmakers use the most optimal settings to improve performance, such as the bare minimum of fuel and switching off air conditioning.
She says carmakers might remove windscreen wipers, wing mirrors, and spare wheels, and even tape up doors to reduce drag.
""I don't think manufacturers (in the EU) break the rules, but they do bend them,"" she says. ""Everyone is gaming the tests in Europe.""
Even the VCA, on its website, says that ""because of the need to maintain strict comparability of the results achieved by the standard tests, they cannot be fully representative of real-life driving conditions"". The VCA declined to comment.
The UK trade body for carmakers, the SMMT, denies that car makers modify cars to reduce drag.
""All car components are present, and fluids and tyre pressures are set at recommended in-use levels and vehicle manufacturers do not - indeed cannot - remove mirrors, over-inflate tyres, tape over panel gaps or any such activity to gain advantage in the tests,"" said Mike Hawes chief executive of the SMMT.
In a statement released on Monday the SMMT said that the European motor industry ""accepts that the current test method for cars is out of date, and is seeking agreement from the European Commission for a new emissions test that embraces new testing technologies, and which is more representative of on-road conditions"".
In the US, test cycles are longer and more rigorous, including for city driving, on motorways, and aggressive driving. There are also ""supplemental tests"", including running a car with air conditioning on.
Manufacturers do their own tests and submit reports to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the regulator taking action against VW. If the EPA is suspicious of the results it conducts its own inspections.
""It's much harder to set the car up to game the test in the US,"" said Ms Thomas. ""The EPA also spot-checks, although they do not do a lot.""
There is also an argument that US regulators are prepared to come down harder on firms that breach its rules. In 2014, Hyundai and Kia agreed a $100m (Â£66m) settlement after under-stating emissions data.
Max Warburton, automotive expert at analysts Sanford C. Bernstein, says: ""The European standards are easier to meet, so there is less need to cheat.
""The ambiguity of the European rules suggests that even if VW were found to have used complex software to cheat the tests, it would be difficult to fine the company.
""The thing now is, the EU [European Union] and other regulators are going to climb all over [carmakers] and this will speed up the introduction of much tougher tests and rules.""
The EU has proposed real-world testing from 2017, with new proposals to close loopholes and adapt to new technologies that allow manufacturers to flatter their data.
The plans, still to be finalised, include using portable emissions meters to identify NOx, and to put on-road cars through a series of tests.
The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association is not impressed. The proposals are ""very incomplete"", it says, adding that even in the real word, standards of driving differ depending on location, weather, and driving style.
Amid the claim and counter-claim, experts warn not to forget that getting the testing right is an urgent matter of public health.
Prof Alastair Lewis, Professor of Atmospheric Chemistry, University of York, says much public policy is based on the test results.
""The reasons the tests are conducted is ultimately so that air pollution can be managed appropriately,"" he says. ""Emissions data from manufacturers is used by governments to simulate future air pollution levels and set policy.""
It was predicated a decade a ago that, for example, NOx in city centres would be on a downward trend, he said.
""But this was based on cars emitting NOx at the rates suggested by the manufacturers' test data, and the reality is that NOx has effectively plateaued in most cities, and in many places is above the European air quality standards.""",The scandal involving Volkswagen cheating car pollution rules in the US has thrown a spotlight on emissions testing - particularly in Europe.

"Dawn Goodacre said she regularly slept with nine-week-old Henry Whitehouse nuzzled in her shoulder and would wake to breastfeed him at regular intervals.
He did not regain consciousness on 20 December and died at Northampton General Hospital.
Coroner Anne Pember recorded an open verdict and repeated her warning that co-sleeping is unsafe.
It comes just two weeks after the inquest of 11-week-old Darcie-Rose Souster, who was starved of oxygen while sleeping on her father's arm at home in Wellingborough.
Ms Goodacre sobbed throughout her evidence at Northampton County Hall.
""I went to kiss him on the head and I realised his temperature wasn't right,"" she said.
""I screamed to get an ambulance.""
He was taken to Northampton General Hospital but did not regain consciousness and died.
Henry's father, Kieron Whitehouse, said he and Ms Goodacre were ""both in shock and devastated"".
In a statement read to the court, he said Henry was Dawn's fifth child and while he was unexpected - Ms Goodacre hadn't realised she was pregnant until she gave birth - he was well cared for and much loved.
Consultant paediatric pathologist Dr Roger Malcomson, who oversaw the post-mortem examination, said the cause of death was unascertained but linked to sudden unexplained death in infancy and ""in the context"" of co-sleeping with parents.
Mrs Pember said she wanted to alert all parents that ""to sleep with a baby is an unsafe sleeping environment whether on a bed or a sofa.""","A baby sleeping with his mum on a sofa was found cold and unresponsive when she woke up, an inquest has heard."
"The plaques, dating from the 1920s, were taken from Woodhenge, which is two miles (3 km) from its more famous contemporary, Stonehenge.
They describe and show a plan of the site, which was discovered by accident in 1925 by a passing RAF pilot.
The plaques were originally installed by the Ministry of Works following archaeological excavations.
Heather Sebire, from English Heritage, which cares for this site, said: ""Woodhenge is an incredibly important heritage site and these plaques are a landmark in the history of how the site was discovered, excavated and presented nearly a century ago.
""This is a serious case of heritage crime. We are working with Wiltshire Police and Historic England to identify the culprits and hope we can return the plaques to where they belong.""
Phil McMahon, inspector of ancient monuments for Historic England, said: ""The sad theft of these historic plaques has deprived us of an important aspect of the story of Woodhenge.
""They represent a key part of one of the earliest attempts to interpret and present to the public the complex and internationally-significant prehistoric monuments of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site.
""We very much hope that the plaques can be recovered and restored to their rightful place at Woodhenge.""
Woodhenge dates back to about 2300 BC, and is thought to have been an important communal meeting place for people in the later Stone Age.
Today, 168 concrete posts mark the positions of the original six concentric rings of gigantic timbers, which lay inside a circular ditch called a henge.
Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them.",A pair of bronze plaques have been stolen from a prehistoric monument in Wiltshire.
"The 3,000m (10,000ft) volcano is in Argentina's south-western Neuquen province, near the Chilean border. It began spewing ash and gas on Saturday morning.
In Argentina, the authorities have told residents of local villages to monitor the situation.
Many people have already left the area as a precaution.
Ash has been raining down on both sides of the border.
The Chilean authorities raised the alert - first issued on Saturday - to the highest level in Biobio region after the Copahue volcano increased seismic activity overnight.
Roads were being cleared for possible evacuation.
The plume of smoke is about 1,500m (5,000ft) high and the wind is pushing it away from Argentina, said Chile's emergency office (Onemi).
Planes flying over the southern Andes have also been warned to avoid the area.
Hundreds of flights were cancelled last year due to the eruption of Puyehue volcano, in Chile.
That eruption caused huge economic damage not only to property in the area but also to tourism in Bariloche and other resorts.
The Copahue eruption comes at the height of the tourism season.
Visitors from all over the world go to the area in the summer months to enjoy the mountains, lakes and also the Copahue and Caviahue thermal spas.
Copahue in the indigenous Mapuche language means ""sulphur waters"".","Chile has raised the alert level for the Copahue volcano to red, the highest possible."

"On Friday, we saw signs of what shape such a shift may take.
In a post on the platform he runs, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman suggested the technology industry - and the complex spider's web of relationships within it - needs to agree on what he's called a Decency Pledge, a code of conduct most would consider to just be responsible, professional behaviour, but in the technology business apparently needs to be hammered home.
Mr Hoffman's post - which I'll go into more detail about in a moment - followed a damning report published on Thursday by The Information - a subscription-only tech news service.
It shared details alleging several instances of sexual harassment by a prominent venture capitalist, Justin Caldbeck, who by Friday afternoon had taken a leave of absence from Binary Capital, where he is/was a managing partner.
The Information quoted several women, some of whom chose to make their identities public - a stance not often taken in this industry, but one buoyed by the efforts of Susan Fowler, the former Uber employee who blogged about her treatment at the firm, kicking off Uber's torrid phase.
From the report: ""The women who made the allegations include Niniane Wang, who co-created Google Desktop and served as CTO of Minted, and Susan Ho and Leiti Hsu, co-founders of Journy, a travel planning and booking service.
""Ms Wang alleges Mr Caldbeck, while informally trying to recruit her for a tech company job, tried to sleep with her.
""Ms Ho said that Mr Caldbeck, while discussing investing in their start-up, sent her text messages in the middle of the night suggesting they meet up. Ms Hsu says that Mr Caldbeck groped her under a table at a Manhattan hotel bar.""
Mr Caldbeck responded to the allegations on Friday afternoon.
""The past 24 hours have been the darkest of my life,"" he said in a statement first reported by Axios.
""I have made many mistakes over the course of my career, some of which were brought to light this week. To say I'm sorry about my behaviour is a categorical understatement. Still, I need to say it: I am so, so sorry.""
He said he apologised for contributing to a ""gender hostile"" environment.
""The power dynamic that exists in venture capital is despicably unfair,"" he continued.
""The gap of influence between male venture capitalists and female entrepreneurs is frightening and I hate that my behaviour played a role in perpetrating a gender-hostile environment. It is outrageous and unethical for any person to leverage a position of power in exchange for sexual gain, it is clear to me now that that is exactly what I've done.""
Unlike Uber, a service used by millions around the world, the allegations against Mr Caldbeck will not generate many headlines. While well-known among the movers of Silicon Valley, like many big-time investors here, Mr Caldbeck operates in a world the majority of the public don't get to see.
But the ramifications of this fall from grace, coming as it does so soon after the Uber scandal, point to a bigger picture in which those previously worried to speak out are deciding that it's a risk worth taking.
But LinkedIn's Mr Hoffman points out that preventing abuses of power between investors and those eager for their money - but not sexual advances - is difficult. Unlike a manager-employee relationship within a company, where good firms can use thorough HR measures to prevent abuse, these are interactions happening between people from separate firms, and one where the balance of power is tipped heavily in one direction.
In other words, there is no way to ""refer up"" a complaint - other than going to the press, a terrifying and potentially career-limiting approach.
""I think the industry should actively work on building a kind of industry-wide HR function,"" Mr Hoffman writes.
""So that venture capitalists who engage in such behaviour face the same sort of consequences that they would if their overtures were directed at an employee.""

"Nyom also revealed that after initially rejecting his country's call-up he changed his mind - but coach Hugo Broos told him there was no place for him.
After winning the trophy on Sunday, Broos said those Cameroonian players not there would rue their decision.
""Let him know that I don't have any regrets,"" Nyom told BBC World Football.
The 28-year-old was one of seven Cameroon players to decide to miss the tournament, with Liverpool defender Joel Matip another high-profile absentee.
After Cameroon beat Egypt 2-1 in Sunday's final Broos suggested ""it was their decision, but maybe they are saying now to themselves 'why didn't I go with them?'""
However, Nyom is adamant he made the right choice.
""I heard what Broos said. It made me laugh because he knew what happened and he knew why I was not there.
""It's true, at first I didn't want to go, but afterwards I changed my mind. But he knew that and he knows what he told me, so I have no worries, no regrets.
""If before the tournament they had told me 'Cameroon is going to win and you are not part of the squad', I don't mind because I'm happy I'm playing for my club - it's much more important for me.

"Leading an opposition day debate on education and social mobility, Ms Rayner urged ministers to drop plans to expand the grammar system.
She called for a more wide-ranging approach to improving standards.
Education Secretary Justine Greening said grammars boosted social mobility.
Speaking in the Commons, Ms Rayner  said: ""The purpose of today's debate is to send a message that members of all parties are committed to an evidence-based approach to education policy and not pursuing the failed policy of academic selection - because we know that this policy is not the answer to Britain's social mobility crisis and the government knew that too until very recently.""
She said: ""Already in the consultation document launched in November, the government pledged Â£50m to help existing grammar schools expand.
""The same green paper made a series of substantial un-costed pledges to those schools that want to become grammars, or the academy chains that want to open them.
""Now, just this weekend, government sources have briefed the Sunday Times that there will be tens of millions more to help grammar schools expand.
""The idea that this is the way the government should spend taxpayers' money is simply baffling when nurseries across the country are facing closure because the government will not deliver the investment needed to deliver on their manifesto pledge to deliver 30 hours of free childcare a week, when our schools are facing deeper cuts in their budgets than any time since the 1970s.""
But Ms Greening said the expansion of selective education could help promote social mobility.
""In reality, as challenging as it is for our country, there is no country in this world that has managed to crack the issue of social mobility yet,"" she said.
""The reality is that grammars can have potentially a transformational impact in some of the most deprived communities where we want to see the biggest changes.""
Later in the debate, Conservative MP for Croydon South, Chris Philp, spoke of ""the terrible, terrible unfairness that in our system today, very often, the only way to be sure of an outstanding education is to pay for it - either by going private or buying a much more expensive house in the catchment area of a good school"".
He said: ""And it is a disgrace that the only way to be sure of an academically elite education is to pay for it today.""
Mr Philp also cited evidence he said suggested children from ""ordinary"" backgrounds did better in grammar schools.
White boys from under-privileged backgrounds who attended a grammar school had a ""30% higher chance of going to university"" than those who did not,"" he said.
But former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell accused him of ""absolutely rubbishing"" the existing  system.
Intervening in Mr Philp's speech, Ms Powell said: ""I think any parent or teacher watching this and hearing somebody from the government benches saying that the only way to guarantee an excellent education is to pay for it is absolutely rubbishing our excellent education system.""
Former Tory cabinet minister and MP for Wokingham John Redwood said new grammar schools were a good idea because talented young footballers and musicians were selected at a young age to hone their talents.
He said: ""When I asked the shadow secretary of state whether she was upset by the fact that our elite sports people have usually been selected at quite a young age for special training, special education, and that they are expected to achieve to a much higher level than the average and they are given training and made to do extra work in order to do so, and she didn't seem at all upset by that in any way.""
Labour MP Stella Creasy suggested the England football team's performance could be better if it had more players from comprehensive schools,
Intervening, Ms Creasy said: ""I'm glad you mentioned football because actually 13% of our national football team went to a private school, which is double the number of children who go to private schools nationally.
""Do you think that might account for the performance of our national football team, if we're missing out on the talent that exists in the comprehensive sector?
""And will he recognise that that is precisely the problem that we're looking at today? We're missing out on talent as a result of too narrow a focus.""
Labour's motion, which said there was no evidence that extra academic selection would improve social mobility, was defeated by 310 votes to 263.
A government amendment welcoming its continuing consultation on schools was approved unopposed.","Allocating cash for the expansion of grammar schools in England when other parts of the education sector face funding concerns is ""baffling"", shadow education secretary Angela Rayner says."
"The 2-1 home triumph earned Livi an unassailable 16-point lead at the summit with four games remaining.
After a flying Alloa start, the hosts' Josh Mullin and Jackson Longridge scored either side of half-time.
Dylan Mackin pulled one back for the Wasps, but Livi squeezed home, sealing their return to the Championship at the first time of asking.
Livingston needed only to avoid defeat to secure promotion, but when the visitors struck the post twice in the opening six minutes, a title-clinching result looked far from straightforward.
That was until Pittman produced a sweetly-struck 35-yard drive to nudge the home side ahead after 17 minutes - a lead they preserved until the interval.
David Hopkin's men upped the ante as the second half began, Longridge cutting in from the left flank and curling a right-foot shop beyond Neil Parry in the Alloa goal.
Livi's prolific Liam Buchanan was denied a 26th goal of the season when his penalty struck the post, and he illegally converted the rebound before any other player had touched the ball.
Mackin halved the deficit with 24 minutes to play, capitalising on confusion in the Livi box following a corner, and subjecting the home fans to a tense finale before the celebrations could begin.
Livingston manager David Hopkin: ""I'm delighted for my team, my staff and everyone that's worked hard to get us back where we belong in the Championship.
""We went top in October and stayed there ever since. It's great credit to the players. Every one of them has been fantastic.
""It was important we bought right, and I made sure I did my homework to get people in. I knew Mikey Miller, Sean Crichton from my days at Morton, I knew they'd won the league, I knew Sean Burn had won the league.
""It was important I tried to get these guys in to try and mould a team and a squad together that had already seen this league through. It's a very difficult league, there are lot of good players and good managers in it. I'm delighted that we've kept going and got over the line.""

"The largest dinosaur on show at Wollaton Hall in Nottingham will be the 23m (75ft) Mamenchisaurus, which will be displayed ""rearing up on its legs"".
The massive plant eater would not fit into the hall at full length.
In 2011 the museum closed for several days to allow filming for the Batman movie The Dark Knight Rises.
The museum will reopen on 30 June for the launch of the exhibition.
Curator Adam Smith said: ""The collection will tell the story of how dinosaurs evolved into the birds and will feature some of the biggest dinosaur skeletons in existence.""

The Mamenchisaurus, a planting-eating sauropod similar to a brontosaurus, was found in Sichuan Province in south west China in the 1970s.
Some of the 23 exhibits, including the Gigantorapror, a birdlike dinosaur with a toothless beak, are considered ""national treasures"" in China.

Arsenal were 4-0 down but took the game to extra-time, with a Theo Walcott hat-trick and two Marouane Chamakh goals helping them into the last eight.
""We went from disaster to rescuing some pride,"" Wenger said. ""You cannot play for Arsenal and give up.""
Reading boss Brian McDermott said the defeat was the ""worst"" of his career.
Arsenal found themselves 4-0 down after 35 minutes but Walcott made it 4-1 just before half-time to set up the platform for an incredible second-half revival that took the game into extra time.
Chamakh put Arsenal in front for the first time on the night with a goal in the first period of extra time, only for Reading striker Pavel Pogrebnyak to make it 5-5. But Walcott restored Arsenal's lead before Chamakh scored their seventh.
""It was 4-0 and could have been one or two more,"" Wenger added. ""We came back but at 89 minutes it was still 4-2. Then the miracle happened. There were so many turning points. Our first goal before half-time was important. It's my first 7-5. It was a tennis score.""
Wenger said he knew the pain of relinquishing a four-goal advantage, having drawn 4-4 with Newcastle after being 4-0 up in February 2011. He explained that his team had drawn inspiration from their supporters.
He said: ""I know how it feels to lose a 4-0 lead - it happened to me at Newcastle. I always hoped we could come back. It's strange to explain. At 4-0 you think you have won the game, but at 4-2 the panic starts to set in.

"It is to build a replica of the magnificent palace used from 1702 by the kings of Prussia. Where there is now wasteland in the heart of Berlin, the plan is to recreate the courtyards and ornate domes which were once fit for Frederick the Great.
Or at least, to create the appearance of them. The plan is to build the facade of the old palace on three sides, with a modern interior and a modern fourth side facing the River Spree.
The way a country sees its buildings reflects the way it might like to see itself.
Berlin's Nazi past has nearly vanished. The pockmarks from bomb shrapnel all over the city have been filled in. The important buildings of the Hitler regime are car parks or they are used to house exhibitions illustrating the misdeeds.
But there is a yearning for the grandeur of the 19th Century.  As onlookers at the ceremony to lay the foundation stone put it: ""It's important for German history to build us this kind of castle.
""It's good for the history of Germany to make other people see how it has been here in the past.""
The mayor of Berlin, Klaus Wowereit, told the BBC: ""We are rebuilding something that got lost in the troubled history of this city, a city that had to go through two world wars and the communist dictatorship.""
The original palace survived the bombing of the war - just. It remained standing but damaged.  What finally destroyed it was the communist regime of the German Democratic Republic.
It decided that a royal palace did not quite fit the zeitgeist, applied dynamite and turned it to rubble, using the flattened site to build its parliament.
When communism fell, the new authorities decided that the parliament was a pretty ugly and worthless landmark and demolished that too - leaving a gaping space and so room for the recreation of the royal palace at an estimated cost of about 600m euros (Â£509m; $800m).
And that is one reason for the controversy surrounding the scheme.
Germany now has a string of big construction projects which are massively over-budget and behind time.
Berliners swing between mirth and anger when they discuss the city's new airport.  It was supposed to open two years ago but delay after delay means it will not now open until 2014 at the earliest.
The cost has soared as steeply as the planes that do not take off from its runways. Currently, the estimate is double the initial budget.
On top of that, there are elements of farce such as the trains which have to run to it every day - empty - to keep the lines in good shape (and the money meter clicking away furiously). Then there are the lights in the terminal that cannot be regulated so they shine through the night.
Or there is the Elbphilharmonie on the waterfront in Hamburg.  This concert hall and five-star hotel in shimmering glass on top of an old warehouse was meant to cost 180m euros and meant to open in 2010.  The current estimate is nearly 450m euros with an opening time of 2017.
It is generating much despair in the city. Marcel Schweitzer of the Association of Taxpayers in Hamburg told the BBC:  ""In the beginning we were very excited by this idea but the costs have increased so much that we are now depressed. The people say it's just ridiculous.""
But Germany is meant to get these things right.  It is the country, above all others, associated with efficiency and value for money. ""Germany"" and ""austerity"" are meant to go together.
So what has gone wrong?  There are lots of theories. The most popular one is that politicians have grand ambitions but to get them approved, both by the democratically elected government and by the people themselves, the final bill has to be under-estimated. Snags get minimised. Little account of future problems is made.
Dr Dieter Faulenbach da Costa, an architect and city planner, told the BBC that political pressure to get big projects off the ground meant that the planning process was being done far too quickly.  The result was that approval was being given for outlines of projects rather than for the detailed schemes as they might actually turn out.
That, he said, is what has happened with the new Berlin airport:  ""We have a nice design but the functionality of the building is not good.
""They need 115 stands for aircraft but they only have 85. They need 220 check-in counters but they've got far fewer. This means the capacity of the new airport is too small to handle the actual passenger and aircraft flow"".
It may, of course, be a problem to do with many democratic societies. A study called ""Survival of the Un-fittest"" by Bent Flyvbjerg of the Said Business School at Oxford University talked about ""perverse incentives that encourage promoters to underestimate costs and overestimate benefits in the business cases for their projects"".
He said ""the projects that are made to look best on paper are the projects that amass the highest cost overruns and benefit shortfalls"".
As German commentator Georg Diez put it in plainer English in a Spiegel article:  ""First, someone comes up with something; then everyone does something completely different; and finally the whole thing goes haywire.""
But if it is a problem for many democratic societies, why is it that Germany has so many big projects which are over-budget and behind time?
The reason may be that there are just more of them in Germany at the moment.
It is a country which is rebuilding and recreating itself.  It has a new identity after communism, division and also the war.  And a new identity means new ambitious structures.  The country is becoming more confident - and richer.  The demand for big, prestige buildings is rising and so is the supply of available money to fund them.
But not an unlimited supply of money.  Some of these projects were started at a time of pre-crash boundless optimism but now struggle in the Age of Austerity.
So will the palace work out on budget and on time, then?  The mayor of Berlin responded without complete certainty:  ""Well, you never know in the beginning do you?  We'll pay the bill when we're finished.  But let's say the prospects are good.""
Berliners are not confident. One paper called the construction site where the palace will - if everything goes to plan - rise from the rubble ""Berlin's newest big money pit"".","Amid much grandeur, President Joachim Gauck of Germany has just laid the foundation stone of one of the country's most ambitious post-war projects."

""Her goal was to continue her development and mount a serious challenge for a medal in Tokyo.
""To do this she had a personal award from UK Sport to allow her to train full time and a competition budget to allow her to compete all over the world to gain the necessary points.
""All of this has now been taken away yet Kirsty's costs associated with training every day and competing around 20 times a year all over the world must still be met.""
Badminton Scotland will continue to financially support Gilmour, but Smillie questioned the UK Sport decision.
""I see no justification for leaving an Olympic medal winning sport with no funding whatsoever, especially when sports that didn't win medals or reach their targets have retained their funding,"" she said.
""UK Sport's reasoning that badminton is unlikely to win a medal in Tokyo and that our GB players need to be more consistent against the very best in the world is a poor excuse.
""Badminton won a men's doubles medal in Rio: a shock result because it wasn't the medal chance that had been predicted but less of a shock to those who know the quality of the badminton programme.
""Badminton exceeded its targets, has a strong pathway and has a strategic plan which was approved by UK Sport.
""Where there is a robust system in place, 'shock results' are always possible.""
Former GB wheelchair rugby captain Mike Kerr, who is transitioning to athletics, was also fearful of the impact on his former team-mates.
""I am absolutely gutted for the players,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""They will be absolutely devastated by the news.
""It is going to have a massive impact on the guys. A lot of the guys rely on this funding for training.
""It's a very expensive sport to play - equipment costs, training costs and travelling to and from training.""
GB wheelchair rugby chief executive David Pond was also ""incredibly disappointed"".
""I think we put up a very strong case, which was listened to by the board, and so we're slightly surprised that the decision has actually stayed as it was,"" he said.
""In terms of what it means for the sport, unless we can find another source of funding, and it has to be a significant source of funding, then it's very difficult to see how we can have a competitive team at all that goes towards Tokyo.
""It feels to me like a real betrayal of the London 2012 legacy. We've been one of the real success stories of that and this feels like a real kick in the teeth.""",Badminton Scotland has called for government intervention after UK Sport confirmed funding cuts to seven sports.
"Christophe Hillairet expressed concern that food produced outside the European Union could easily cross a ""soft"" Irish border and enter EU markets.
He is the president of the Chamber of Agriculture of Ile de France.
However, his comments were criticised as ""disappointingly self-centred"" by an Irish dairy industry leader.
Speaking to the Agra Europe website, [Â£] Mr Hillairet said he was worried that the British government will sign deals to import food from Commonwealth countries post-Brexit and that those products could then be transported across a future EU land border via Northern Ireland.
""Ireland is a big problem but for the French farmer, we will need to have a hard border between the north and the Republic, as otherwise we will have a lot of products that will cross from north to south.
""That would be very dangerous for our producers.""
Both the British and Irish governments have repeatedly said they do not want a return to a hard border on the island of Ireland, expressing concerns over the potential impact on the economy and the Northern Ireland peace process.
However, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said that there will have to be some form of customs controls along the Irish border after Brexit.
On a two-day visit to the Republic of Ireland last week, Mr Barnier said:  ""We want to find solutions without rebuilding any kind of hard border, but we have to find solutions also compatible with the single market.""
Mr Hillairet has been president of the Chamber of Agriculture of Ile de France since 2006.
He told Agra Europe that he believed it was ""simply not possible to have a soft Brexit and still maintain the advantage which the EU has a trading bloc"".
He urged remaining EU member states to ""work together to protect Europe"".
Mr Hillairet's remarks were criticised by the president of the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA), John Comer.
He argued that the interests of Irish border communities, who had suffered during Northern Ireland's Trouble, must also be protected.
Mr Comer said that ""with respect to our French friends, we would prefer them to reflect on the common good and not just on their own particular sectoral anxieties"".",The president of a French farming union has called for the re-introduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland after Brexit.
"It makes changes to the way users navigate around the console's dashboard and speeds up many common tasks such as checking what friends are doing.
It also adds backwards compatibility to the console so it can play many older Xbox 360 games.
Initially, 104 older games, including Gears of War and Mirror's Edge, will be playable on the console.
The update started to roll out to consoles at 07:01 GMT, but it is being staggered because it needs to be being applied to more than 12 million devices.
The big update changes the console's underlying operating system so it works better with Windows 10 - the latest release of Microsoft's flagship software. Before now, the underlying software of the game system was much closer to Windows 8.
It changes the dashboard, and a further upgrade next year will add some specific Windows 10 features to the Xbox One such as the Cortana voice-driven query system.
It also removes some older features, including the gesture-based control system and menu layout required for the Kinect motion sensor.
The addition of backwards compatibility for older games will be activated in an update due to start 12 hours after the first global rollout.
The long list of games supported includes a lot of very old titles such as 1992's Wolfenstein 3D, but also some more-up-to date ones such as Assassin's Creed II.
Microsoft has said games including Halo Reach, Call of Duty: Black Ops and Skate 3 will be added to the list next year. It is also accepting nominations for games to add to the roster of older titles via its Xbox feedback site.
Xbox 360 owners who upgrade to the newer console will get copies of their older games on the Xbox One at no additional cost.
Sony has set its face against providing backwards compatibility on its PlayStation 4 console. In October, Sony Europe head Jim Ryan told Europe told Eurogamer that it was a feature that ""was not used very much.""
Early reviews of an updated console suggest it does improve basic navigation tasks.
""It feels like Microsoft is now recovering from its giant Xbox One launch mess, and the company has the right focus for its games console, said Tom Warren on tech news site The Verge.
However, he added, the update still had some ""issues"" with multiplayer-gaming and TV integration that had to be addressed in future updates.
Microsoft has acknowledged many of these problems on a dedicated support page and given advice about how to troubleshoot and fix them.",A big update for Microsoft's Xbox One is due to start downloading to consoles around the world on Thursday.

"Deaf and blind people face a situation that is ""still grim"", according to charities Action on Hearing Loss Cymru, RNIB Cymru and Sense Cymru.
New standards were introduced by the Welsh government over a year ago aimed at ensuring equal access to healthcare.
But the report says little progress has been made.
Richard Williams, director of Action on Hearing Loss Cymru said the charities that authored the report are ""really concerned"" that people are leaving surgeries and hospitals unclear about what doctors have told them, what medication they need or whether operations have been successful.
New standards were brought in after a BBC Wales investigation in 2013 found health boards were breaching equality laws by not providing accessible services for the deaf and hard of hearing.
But 91 per cent of people surveyed for the report said they were not aware of improvements in the way healthcare providers communicate and share information with them.
Kay Coleman from Swansea began losing her hearing 15 years ago and said she finds it ""incredibly difficult"" to book a doctor's appointment.
An estimated 500,000 people are affected by hearing loss and 100,000 are living with sight loss in Wales.

"Lord Patten, who supports the UK remaining in the EU, said Mr Johnson, a prominent Leave campaigner, ""just makes it up as he goes along"".
He also said it would be ""very difficult"" for David Cameron to remain leader if the UK voted to leave the EU.
Vote Leave said it was saddened at ""the level of debate"" from the Remain camp.
Mr Johnson has previously said voters want proper debate and to hear about the issues, ""not personal attacks"".
The UK decides whether to stay in or leave the European Union in a referendum on 23 June.
The Conservative Party is deeply split over the the issue, with David Cameron and most of his cabinet campaigning for a Remain vote but about half of the MPs supporting an EU exit.
The debate inside the party has turned increasingly acrimonious, with former deputy prime minister and pro-Remain campaigner Lord Heseltine recently accusing Mr Johnson of losing his judgement over the EU.
Lord Patten, Tory party chairman from 1990 to 1992, added to that criticism of the former London mayor, in an interview with Newsnight's David Grossman on Friday.
""Boris just makes it up as he goes along, and you come across people like that,"" he said.
""There's a sense in which you can't call Boris a liar. I think he's one of those people in life who simply doesn't really understand the difference between fact and fiction.""
He added: ""If he can make a good joke by saying something, or if he can write a newspaper article by referring to Hitler and the European Union, he does it - and he doesn't think about it.
""He'll be saying the opposite in a few months' time.""
Lord Patten, a European commissioner from 2000 to 2004, said Mr Johnson was an ""amiable"" character, but added: ""Boris is Boris. Tommy Cooper was Tommy Cooper.""
In response, Vote Leave said: ""It's sad to see the level of debate the 'Remainers' have been reduced to. They were wrong about the euro then and they are wrong now.""
And speaking to BBC Newsnight, Leave campaigner Jacob Rees Mogg suggested that Lord Patten's ""anger is almost certainly synthetic"".
The MP suggested Lord Patten was trying to ""bash down"" Mr Johnson because he knows that the former London mayor was ""hugely popular and trusted"" and was making the case for an EU exit ""exceptionally effectively"".
The Daily Mail reported earlier this week that ""senior party figures"" had warned of a vote of no-confidence in Mr Cameron after 23 June, whatever the outcome, over his handling of the referendum campaign.
On the question of re-uniting the Conservative Party after the referendum, Lord Patten said that if the UK voted to Leave the EU it would be ""very difficult"" for Mr Cameron to stay on as leader.
""Are people like Michael Gove and Mr Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith... are they all going to require Mr Cameron to go cap in hand around Europe for the next few years trying to negotiate new trade deals and new agreements with the EU?
""I don't know,"" he said.
Lord Patten said if Britain voted to remain in the EU, Mr Cameron would have to assert his authority and try to bring the party together.
But he suggested the PM should give Mr Johnson a challenging cabinet post, such as running the Department for Health.
""That will really test whether there is something behind all the jokes,"" he said.
Lord Patten also criticised the wider Vote Leave campaign, saying it's objective appeared to be ""to keep the turnout as low as possible and to tell young people to stay at home and not vote"", which , he said, was ""extraordinary"".
And he added: ""I worry that for a lot of the Brexiteers, in a sort of spittle-flecked way, this is a neverendum, not a referendum.""
Also in the interview, the former Tory party chairman conceded that he had made the wrong call on Britain joining the Euro.
""I put my hand up,"" he said. ""Everybody occasionally makes a mistake and I think I was wrong about that.""","Boris Johnson does not seem to understand ""the difference between fact and fiction"", former Tory chairman Lord Patten has told BBC Newsnight."

"On-loan Sam Gallagher looked to have won it on his first start for Rovers, heading in Craig Conway's corner.
But Naylor met Matty Palmer's left-wing corner to seal a dramatic point.
Conway had put Rovers ahead in the first half with a 25-yard drive that flew in off the bar, but Burton levelled with Jackson Irvine's header.
A first-ever meeting between the two sides saw Rovers teenage academy product Scott Wharton handed a debut and he made an important early intervention to deflect John Mousinho's header wide.
But after Conway took a Danny Graham pass to rifle in the 12th goal of his Rovers career, Burton, who did not include new loan signing John Brayford in their squad, were level just before the break as Mousinho's right-wing cross was met by an unmarked Irvine.
Rovers started the second half brightly, only for Hope Akpan to head over a Conway free-kick, before Albion were unlucky when Naylor's long range drive crashed against the crossbar.
Gallagher, on loan from Southampton, nodded in at the near post to put Rovers back in front, but Naylor was not to be denied to heap more pressure on Coyle, whose side are bottom of the Championship and the only club in the division still without a league win.
Blackburn manager Owen Coyle: ""Having got ourselves ahead twice in the game, we could have seen it out and got the three points we were worthy of.
""We all know it can be a cruel game but, having said that, there were a lot of positives we can take from the game - not least the performance of young Scott Wharton at the back on his debut.""

"This follows reports that some restaurant chains are regularly holding back some or all of the tips meant for their staff.
The investigation will consider whether there should be a cap on the proportion of tips businesses can withhold.
Trade union Unite opposes this, however, saying it would be ""impossible to enforce"".
Mr Javid has ordered a formal call for evidence which will end in November.
The investigation will look at how tips left by customers are handled after recent reports found that a proportion of tips at some restaurants were being spent on administrative costs.
There is a voluntary code of practice but restaurants can adopt their own systems.
Unite officer Dave Turnbull said the union was pleased that ""the government has woken up to this scandal"" but an effective solution needed ""careful consideration"".
""Capping admin fees will simply legitimise the underhand practice of restaurants taking a slice of staff tips and be near enough impossible to enforce,"" he said.
""Rather than tinkering around the edges, Sajid Javid should be looking to scrap what is effectively a tax by restaurant bosses on money meant for the pockets of hardworking staff.""
Mr Javid said the government wanted a ""fair deal"" on pay for working people and that this included ""taking action on tipping abuse"".
""I'm concerned about recent reports, suggesting some restaurants pocket tips for themselves. That's just not right,"" he said.
""I've ordered an immediate investigation to look at the evidence and consider the views of employees, customers and the industry to see how we can deal with the abuse of tipping.""
Analysis by BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam
Restaurants have the highest corporate mortality rate.
They pop up and disappear from our high streets with daffodil-like regularity. That's because consumer tastes can change rapidly but also because profit margins are often very low.
Add in high rents and staff costs in Britain's largest cities and restaurants will say they need to maximise every source of income to stay afloat.
But consumers tend to side with waiting staff when it comes to tips. They assume staff will see most, if not all of them - especially if customers have been asked to pay an 'optional' service charge of at least 10% on their bill.
Adding tips to the existing code of practice among restaurants (which is voluntary anyway) may be the solution. But it may be tough to police.
Most waiting staff are either young or foreign - meaning they don't know the law and don't wish to upset their employers.
As part of the investigation information and views from the hospitality industry and other key stakeholders will be sought.
This will help the government decide if ministers need to intervene to strengthen the voluntary code of practice.
Ufi Ibrahim, chief executive of the British Hospitality Association, said the body ""would welcome dialogue with the business secretary on the matter of tipping and the industry code of conduct.""
Most chains use a ""tronc"" system, where all the tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, usually with around 70% going to the waiters, and the rest given to kitchen and other workers.
There is no law regarding how a tronc is divided, however.
A spokesperson for Pizza Express said: ""To cover the administrative costs of ensuring that the tronc system is managed correctly and fairly, a small administrative fee of 8% is levied. Under no circumstances does Pizza Express generate additional profit through the tronc.""
Many high-street chains deduct fees from tips. These include: Ask (8%), Belgo (10%), Bella Italia (10%), CafÃ© Rouge (10%), Prezzo (10%), Strada (10%) and Zizzi (8%).
Recently Giraffe has scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips, joining chains like Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's who do not deduct a fee.
Research from 2009 found that one in five restaurants did not pass tips to their staff, yet the vast majority of customers said they wanted waiting staff to receive the money left for them, the government said.","Business Secretary Sajid Javid has ordered an investigation into the ""abuse"" of tipping in restaurants."
"Halsey said on Twitter that he had ""seen an incident and been told to say I haven't seen it"".
He spoke out after Manchester City's Sergio Aguero received a retrospective three-game ban for violent conduct.
However, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited said: ""There is no pressure to include or omit anything.""
The body's statement continued: ""Match officials submit their reports, including critical incidents, directly to the FA.
""Match officials ensure that their reports are a full and accurate description of the incident.""
Halsey, who retired in 2013, also pointed out these were issues he had previously mentioned in his autobiography three years ago.

Had the incident that saw Aguero banned by a Football Association panel for elbowing West Ham's Winston Reid been witnessed by a match official, including referee Andre Marriner, the retrospective punishment would not have been possible.

"The city council confirmed that the 10 primaries affected will remain closed for the rest of the week.
Contingency plans are being put in place for the five high schools with pupils being phased back to the classroom from Wednesday onwards.
All the schools in question were constructed under the same public private partnership contract.
They were built by Miller Construction, which was acquired by Galliford Try in 2014.
It has been confirmed that Gracemount and Craigmount high schools, plus Oxgangs and St Peter's primary schools, will need urgent repairs before opening their doors once more.
Every Scottish council has either carried out or is going to carry out surveys of school buildings that could be affected.
Edinburgh Council hoped that all primary and special needs pupils would be able to return by the start of next week.
However, the 7,000 youngsters affected on Monday will remain off school on Tuesday.
Officials said that ""significant work"" had been undertaken to ensure that 2,000 S4, S5 and S6 pupils would be accommodated as soon as possible.
Alternative arrangements will need to be worked out for all S1 to S3 pupils.
Edinburgh University, the Scottish Parliament, community groups, venues and private sector companies have all offered help.
The local authority confirmed that structural surveys would continue to be carried out this week.
The closure of the schools, which are about 10 years old, was prompted after workers repairing serious structural issues at one city primary found ""further serious defects"" with the building on Friday.
Edinburgh Schools Partnership (ESP), which operates the schools, could not provide safety assurances and that is why the 17 schools remained closed after the holidays.
Lindsay Cairns' daughter is in primary one at Oxgangs Primary School.
She said: ""I don't know if I'm going to have to have time off next week to look after her.
""I've spoken to my manager. We have to wait and see what the council are going to come back with.
""I'd like to think there's going to be an update and a contingency plan put in place but to me I'd rather have had that contingency plan before now.""
Rachel Bhandari's son is nine years old and has cerebral palsy. His special school is closed until further notice.
She and her husband have spent the weekend trying to organise childcare as they both work.
Ms Bhandari said: ""It presents us with a really big difficulty really. We were expecting the school to be open.
""We were told earlier in the week that it was going to be open and then just to find out on Friday that it's not is a nightmare.""
The problems were first uncovered in January when a wall at Oxgangs Primary collapsed during high winds.
Three other schools were later closed after inspections revealed problems with the way walls had been built.
Amy, 16, a pupil at Firrhill High School, told BBC Scotland: ""It's quite disruptive because we need to finish the coursework and we need to do unit assessments, and they were meant to be happening this week but now they'll have to be done later.
""It's been open for 10 years, the part of the building that was built, and it hasn't fallen down yet. There's no storm just now. Nothing's going to happen.""",Urgent work will be required on several of the 17 Edinburgh schools which were closed due to safety fears.

In a message to BBC Wales, the school said: ""We are thrilled that The Osprey made landfall in Pembrokshire. It was launched on June 13.
""We look forward to interacting with students who may have a chance to view the contents of our time capsule.""
Mr Morgan said he had been unable to remove the vessel from the beach himself as it was very heavy and he did not have transport, but he reported it on social media and it has now been taken to Greenhill Secondary School in Tenby.
Matthew Davies, deputy head, told BBC News: ""We had a message yesterday which came through from a member of staff who also works for the local lifeboat.
""He went to pick [the vessel] up and has brought it into school.""
The boat featured in a Year 8 assembly first thing in the morning and is now waiting to be opened.
""Our excitement was at fever pitch. We're going to wait for our head teacher to make contact with the school in the US and then hopefully do a live weblink with them and open it up.""
Mr Davies added he hoped the boat's arrival would see the start of a link with Kent School.
Asked about the possible contents of the capsule, he said: ""I'd have to leave that to the children. If we were sending them one out we'd maybe send one which was representative of our community and our school. But I'd guess maybe an American flag and a state flag.""",An unmanned boat sent by a school in the USA has washed up on the Pembrokeshire coast three months after it set sail.

"Michelle Rocks' baby was in a sideways position but Dr Rachel O'Flaherty advised a junior colleague not to admit her, an inquest heard.
Dr O'Flaherty apologised to Mrs Rocks and her husband Barry.
Cara Rocks was stillborn at Coleraine's Causeway Hospital on 26 June 2013.
The inquest is the first in Northern Ireland to focus on a stillbirth.
Dr O'Flaherty said she could not recall why she had decided not to admit the patient on 5 June 2013.
""I don't know what information I was given at that time and I honestly can't remember the reasoning behind that decision,"" she said.
When asked whether a Caesarean section would also have been offered, if it had been requested by Mrs Rocks at that time, Dr O'Flaherty said this would have been arranged.
Dr O'Flaherty first came into contact with Mrs Rocks at a hospital appointment when she was 36-weeks pregnant, Belfast Coroners Court heard on the third day of the hearing.
The doctor said that, in retrospect, she would have kept the patient in for observation.
Dr O'Flaherty apologised to Mr and Mrs Rocks and their family for the distress they have experienced.
The Northern Health and Social Care Trust has already admitted a number of mistakes played a part in the death of Cara Rocks.
These included wrongly categorising Michelle Rocks, who had a previous Caesarean section, as ""low risk"", incorrect recording of the baby's heart rate and delays in the decision to proceed to an emergency C-section because of time spent trying to locate a foetal heart beat.
The hearing continues.",The mother of a stillborn baby left court in tears after a doctor accepted she should have been kept in hospital when she was 38-weeks pregnant.

"It has been swapped for a more festive offering, ahead of the town's annual tree light switch-on ceremony.
Local people and councillors had taken to Facebook to cry bah-humbug about the ""sad-looking tree.""
It comes after a festive village tree in Bushmills was removed in 2014 after it was described as ""one of the worst ever seen in the UK"".
UUP councillor, Mark McKinty, posted a photo of the Larne tree on social media and said: ""I'm all for recycling, but when your Christmas tree goes up looking like it's spent a few years on the compost heap, that is a bit much.""
Angry comments were also left on the Mid and East Antrim Council's 'Larne Christmas Switch On' page.
Larne resident Ian Stokes, said ""for many a year Larne has always been the laughing stock of local councils for their awful trees.""
But Mid and East Antrim Council have proven their festive spirit by bringing in a brand new replacement before the local Christmas parade and light switch-on on Friday.
A spokesperson said, ""Mid and East Antrim Borough Council has responded to concerns about the condition of the recently erected Christmas tree in Larne.

"Rooney, 31, played 559 times for United, scoring 253 goals.
He won five Premier League titles and each of the Champions League, Europa League and FA Cup once after joining from Everton for £27m in 2004.
Rooney, who has signed a two-year deal, said he was ""ecstatic"" and his ""first game back will be an emotional day"".
""It's a great feeling to be back. I cannot wait to meet the lads, get on the training pitch and then get on the pitch to play,"" he added.
Rooney's return comes as United look set to sign Everton striker Romelu Lukaku, with a £75m deal for the Belgium international agreed between the two clubs.
Everton confirmed Rooney will wear the number 10 shirt previously worn by Lukaku.
""I'm not just coming back because it's the team I support, the team I grew up playing for - I'm coming back because I feel the club can move forward and be successful,"" said Rooney, who scored 17 goals in 77 games in his first spell at Goodison.
""I want to be part of it. There will be pressure on me to perform, but I'm ready to go. I believe I can help move this club forward and be more successful on the pitch.""
Rooney says when he spoke to Everton manager Ronald Koeman, he ""saw it in his eyes that he wanted me to be part of his team"".
He added: ""It was a no-brainer for me and the only place I was going to go.""
Rooney said he told his agent Paul Stretford to ""go and speak to them, let's make it happen"" when he found out Everton were interested in signing him and it ""was obvious I was going to be leaving Manchester United this summer"".
""There were other options there but once I knew that Everton wanted me to come back then it was the only option for me,"" he added.

Koeman began talking about Rooney's potential return as far back as October, stating he would be ""pleased"" to sign England's all-time leading goalscorer.
On Sunday, he said: ""Wayne has shown me that ambition that we need and that winning mentality - he knows how to win titles and I'm really happy he's decided to come home.
""He loves Everton and he was desperate to come back. He is still only 31 and I don't have any doubts about his qualities. It's fantastic he's here.
""We have a lot of young players and sometimes in life you need somebody who you look up to, who you learn from. That was also one of the messages when we spoke about on and off the pitch what his function will be in the team.
""One of the functions for Wayne is to show the rest of the team why he is - and still is - that player.""
Rooney, who was often left out of United's starting line-up by manager Jose Mourinho last season, appeared in 25 league games - the fewest he has played in one season. His total of eight goals in all competitions was also the lowest of his career.
He also lost his place in the England squad, but has not retired from international duty and needs six more caps to equal goalkeeper Peter Shilton's all-time record of 125 appearances.
Rooney was an unused substitute as United beat Southampton to win the EFL Cup in February, and made only a brief appearance at the end of the Europa League final victory over Ajax in May.
In his 13 seasons with United, he finished as top scorer five times and shared the honour with Cristiano Ronaldo in another campaign. He was also named fans' player of the year twice.
""It is no secret that I have long been an admirer of Wayne,"" said Mourinho. ""He has been a model professional throughout his time at the club and will remain in the history books for many years to come.
""It is never easy to see a great player playing less football than he would like and I could not stand in his way when he asked to go back to Everton.
""His experience, focus and determination will be missed and I wish him well for the future.""
Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward added: ""Who can forget his storybook debut hat-trick against Fenerbahce, the spectacular overhead kick against Manchester City and the countless match-winning performances in his time here?
""But after much discussion, the club has decided to accept his request to rejoin his boyhood team.""

Andy Mitten, editor of fanzine United We Stand: ""The move is best for all parties.
""Rooney will be remembered well by United fans when the dust settles, a club legend who scored more goals than anyone and was a leading light in one of United's greatest sides.
""Reaching three European Cup finals in four years shows how good that team was. At his best, between 2004 and 2011, he was the finest British player of his generation.
""Rooney's performances dropped, and being linked with Chelsea and Manchester City did his popularity no favours either, but he's scored some of the greatest goals I've ever seen.
""As a journalist who has interviewed him several times over 12 years, I watched him mature, become more interesting and grow into being a respected Manchester United captain.""
Rooney was brought up by parents Jeanette and Wayne in the Croxteth area of Liverpool alongside brothers Graham and John, with all five members of the household avid Everton supporters.
He joined the Toffees at the age of nine and quickly built a reputation as a precocious talent, scoring 114 goals in 29 matches for the under-10 and under-11 sides.
David Moyes gave him his first-team debut in August 2002, and he quickly became a regular starter, scoring his first Premier League goal - a last-minute winner against Arsenal - five days before his 17th birthday.
I've kept it quiet for the last 13 years, but I've actually been wearing Everton pyjamas at home with my kids.
The goal led to Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger describing Rooney as ""the biggest English talent I have seen since I arrived in this country"". Wenger added: ""He has everything you dream of for a front player - intelligent feet, quick reactions.""
Rooney became one of world football's highest-paid teenagers with his boyhood club, but handed in a transfer request in August 2004, leading to him being signed by Sir Alex Ferguson for what was the highest fee paid for a player under 20.

BBC Sport's Simon Stone: Rooney has been slowly eased out of the first team, without there being one single pressure point that signalled a change in Mourinho's thinking.
The Portuguese has consistently backed Rooney in public - saying as recently as May that he would be ""very happy"" if the striker stayed at Old Trafford.
But Rooney did not take the chances he was afforded by Mourinho last season, and that made his departure inevitable once Everton pursued their interest.
Rooney signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract during the 2013-14 campaign, which included the option of a further season, but the Old Trafford club had no intention of triggering that clause.
United have waived a fee and may also be funding part of Rooney's £13m wages.

"John McGrogan, 65, of Blackridge, began abusing the girls when they were aged six and 11.
The offences were committed between 1981 and 2005 at addresses in Edinburgh.
The former playground supervisor was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow. He was earlier placed on the sex offenders register.
A judge heard how the victims finally revealed their ordeals in 2014 after McGrogan was convicted of child porn offences.
Lord Burns told McGrogan he had ""exploited"" the duo for his own ""gratification"".
He added the victim impact statements given to him had made ""harrowing"" reading.
McGrogan will also be supervised for a further four years on his release.
The first girl was aged 11 when she was raped. The other was attacked between the ages of six and 11.
Both told how, during the abuse, McGrogan would try and spoil them by buying sweets or computer games.
Tony Lenehan, defending said McGrogan's regret for what happened was ""sincere"".",A West Lothian pensioner who admitted raping two primary schoolgirls has been jailed for for eight and a half years.
"The Manbij Military Council, part of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance, announced it had ""transferred defence of the frontline"".
The move came after a deal was agreed with Russia, a staunch ally of President Bashar al-Assad, it added.
The villages have been a focus of fighting in recent days.
There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government or Turkey, whose troops have been supporting a rebel offensive aimed at driving Islamic State militants from a border area north-west of Manbij and limiting gains by Kurdish fighters.
Syria's military has accused Turkey of a ""flagrant violation of Syrian sovereignty"".
Since launching Operation Euphrates Shield in August, the Turkish-backed rebels have captured more than 1,900 sq km (734 sq miles), according to Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency.
After they captured the IS stronghold of al-Bab last month, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declared that the rebels would next move towards Manbij.
Mr Erdogan also said the Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia, which dominates the SDF and the Turkish government considers an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), should be forced to withdraw.
The YPG captured Manbij from IS militants in August, but it agreed three months later to move its forces east of the River Euphrates after setting up the Manbij Military Council with local Arabs.
But Mr Erdogan rejected claims by the US that Kurdish fighters had left.
On Wednesday, a spokesman for the Manbij Military Council told Reuters news agency that a string of eight villages about 27km (17 miles) west of Manbij that it controlled had come under heavy artillery bombardment by the Turkish-backed rebels and that there had been fierce clashes.
One SDF fighter and two Turkish-backed rebels were killed in the fighting, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
On Thursday, the Manbij Military Council said in a statement that defending the town and countering Turkey's ""invasion plan"" were among its objectives.
It had therefore ""agreed with Russia to hand over villages on the frontline with Euphrates Shield... to the border guards of the Syrian state"", the statement added.
Syrian government forces are deployed just to the south of al-Bab and were involved in clashes with the Turkish-backed rebels shortly before the town fell.
In a separate development, the commander of the US-led coalition against IS said Russian aircraft had mistakenly bombed SDF fighters 16km (10 miles) south-west of Manbij, resulting in an unspecified number of casualties.
Lt Gen Stephen Townsend said the Russian military had thought it was bombing villages held by IS.
However, Russian media cited the Russian defence ministry as denying that Russian or Syrian aircraft had launched any strikes on US-backed forces.",A US-allied Syrian militia has said it will hand over villages west of the town of Manbij to the army in order to stop Turkish-backed rebels taking them.
"It will ""be etched in my memory forever - quite an incredible feeling"", said Peake, the first astronaut representing the UK to carry out a spacewalk.
He and US colleague Tim Kopra were outside the International Space Station (ISS) for almost five hours on Friday.
But the operation was cut short after water leaked into Col Kopra's helmet.
The pair had already replaced a failed electrical box, which was their main objective.
As it happened: Tim Peake's spacewalk
After they returned and were safely inside with the outer airlock hatch closed, Major Peake thanked mission controllers: ""You guys did a great job.""
Later on Friday night, he posted two tweets, two hours apart.
His first included three photographs and by Saturday morning it had had more than 9,000 retweets and 18,000 likes.
It included a selfie that showed his camera in the reflection of his helmet.
A later tweet from Maj Peake said: ""Wrapping up today's spacewalk activities. Huge thanks to the ground teams who make it all possible & keep us safe out there - you guys rock!""
His colleague Tim Kopra also posted photos from the spacewalk, including one of him emerging from the airlock and another of him carrying out repairs on the end of the space station.
Maj Peake's parents later spoke of their excitement at watching their son fulfil a long-term ambition.
""We are absolutely thrilled. This is a proud day,"" his mother Angela said.
Before the spacewalk, the couple said they had watched the ISS fly over their home in the West Sussex village of Westbourne.
""It was a brilliant pass in clear blue skies... it seems quite surreal that your son is up there,"" his father Nigel Peake said.

The spacewalk was expected to last more than six hours but was halted at 16:58 GMT on Friday when a water globule measuring a few inches across developed inside Col Kopra's helmet.
Nasa is under a ruling to terminate a spacewalk under such circumstances after an incident in 2013, when a European astronaut developed a significant helmet leak and nearly drowned.

"Natalia Doherty was last seen on 15 April 2003 in Eastbourne, where she was living at the time.
The house in Icknield Way was searched in September as part of the investigation.
Two men were later arrested and bailed in connection with the disappearance.
A Luton man, aged 66, and a 71-year-old man from Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, were detained on suspicion of assisting an offender and preventing a lawful burial.
Officers said ground survey work was now being carried out on the surface of the garden to see if the ground had been disturbed.
Detectives believe that near to the date she was last seen alive, Ms Doherty - who was also known by the surnames Wilkanowska and Logan - was thought to have travelled to Luton to stay with her ex-husband, Gerald Doherty, who has since died - at the Regents Arms in Hastings Street.
But there were no confirmed sightings of the mother-of-three in the town.
Officers from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire major crime unit launched an investigation in January 2014 into the case, which has led them to believe Ms Doherty was murdered.
A police spokesman said: ""Inquiries have since failed to show any sign she is alive.""
Investigators are keen to trace her final movements and has asked anyone who recognises her or Mr Doherty from their time at the now-demolished pub in Hastings Street, or has any information relating to her disappearance, to contact them.",A garden at a property in Luton is being examined by officers investigating the disappearance of a 50-year-old woman police now believe was murdered.
"The officers said they felt sorry for the migrants, who were found in a lorry in Belgium, and offered to give them a lift to the border.
But they strayed into France, where they were arrested and questioned.
The incident sparked a diplomatic spat, with France's interior minister summoning the Belgian ambassador.
Bernard Cazeneuve had a ""frank and clear"" meeting with the Belgian ambassador, according to French officials, and expressed his disquiet at what had happened.
France strongly condemned the officers' action which ""does not conform to the normal work practices agreed between France and Belgium"".
But there was surprise at the French reaction from Georges Aeck, the Ypres police commissioner, because of the two countries' usual close border co-operation.
""We didn't do it for money, this isn't human trafficking,"" he told Belgian broadcaster RTBF. ""We only gave them a hand. We took them a little way in the direction they wanted to go,""
The bizarre chain of events began on Tuesday evening, when French police in an unmarked car stopped the Belgian police van carrying the 13 migrants, including three minors, on the French side of the border in Nieppe, north-west of Lille.
The migrants had been discovered earlier in the day and ordered to leave the country.
But when the officers spotted them walking on foot towards the border, they offered them a lift and accidentally strayed into France near Nieppe.
The two officers were handcuffed, despite identifying themselves, the Belgian police union said.
Vincent Gilles, the president of the Belgian police union, complained that the officers had been treated like ""criminal suspects"" and held for four hours without access to a lawyer.
Mr Aeck added: ""It's the first time this has happened because we have a good relationship with our French colleagues. We sometimes organise the control system together on the border. We are a little surprised.
""The Belgian officers took the migrants in their van because they didn't want to let them go on foot directly along the road to the border. They escorted the migrants as far as the border, in the direction they wanted to go.""
The migrants themselves were then taken to a police station in the French city of Lille, where three minors were placed in the care of local authorities and the adults temporarily detained to assess their status.
Temporary border controls were brought in by Belgium for a few months earlier this year, amid concerns the proposed demolition of the Calais ""Jungle"" camp would send an influx of migrants north.
Calais is less than an hour's drive from the Belgian border.",Two Belgian policemen have been questioned by their French counterparts after they were caught with 13 illegal immigrants in their car.

""I know there's an interest there,"" said Pressley, who spent three years as a player with United in the 1990s.
""But I don't want to come back to Scotland at this moment.""
Pressley was sacked by Coventry in February after the Sky Blues slipped into the League One relegation zone.
However, the former Scotland defender is determined to succeed in England and has lofty ambitions.
""I have built up a very good reputation in England and I have a burning desire to manage at the elite level,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound.
""That's not an arrogance. That's a belief. In order to do that, I think you have to manage in a country like England.
""I think the right opportunity will arise for me here over the next coming months.""
Pressley cut his teeth in management at Falkirk after a spell as an assistant to Scotland boss George Burley and is sure his grounding in the game will serve him well.
""My first five years in management could not have been more challenging but I wouldn't change them,"" he added.
""Most managers now want to come in at the highest level but I think you have to do an apprenticeship.
""At Falkirk I had to reduce the playing budget by close to 75% in three years. At Coventry we reduced the playing budget by 60% in two years - that was four years work that we put into two.
""I'm very proud of the work that we did but my next job has got to be one where I'm not asked to tidy a club up.

"English Heritage has organised the trek on horseback and foot from York to East Sussex to mark the 950th anniversary of the famous clash.
The volunteers will arrive on the battlefield 950 years to the day since Harold fought William of Normandy.
Nigel Amos, leader of the march for English Heritage, said it was a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"".
King Harold defeated a Viking army at the Battle of Stamford Bridge in East Yorkshire, on 25 September, 1066, before travelling south to face the Normans.
On 14 October, he fought and was killed at the Battle of Hastings.
William then seized the English throne.

"So far most of the ground troops deployed are there to protect the airbase, but satellite evidence suggests that at least two other Syrian bases are being prepared to receive additional Russian troops.
The Russian build-up is being closely monitored - not least by the Israelis, who have been flying intelligence-gathering aircraft off the coast between Cyprus and Lebanon on a regular circuit.
Most of the information available to the media comes from images from civil satellites, but of course US military satellites will also be watching developments, seeking any detail that might give a hint of Russian intentions.
Imagery analysts will be looking for evidence of weapons stores; of munitions being loaded on to aircraft or for any other signs of jets being prepared for operational sorties.
The electromagnetic spectrum will also be monitored from Western bases in Cyprus and from Israel, where the military has no shortage of Russian speakers.
Reports suggest that some of the Russian aircraft have already been undertaking familiarisation flights in Syrian airspace. But the question remains - what will Moscow do next?
Is this all preliminary to a direct Russian intervention in the fighting? Or is this something else - military theatre on a grand scale to achieve wider diplomatic objectives?
What President Vladimir Putin appears to be doing in Syria is to use at least the threat of military force to pursue his wider diplomatic goals.
To see what is going on, one must pull back from the close-up images of Russian warplanes on the tarmac and look at the wider diplomatic picture.
Russia - isolated and confronting Western sanctions due to its behaviour in Ukraine - is genuinely concerned about the rise of Islamist fundamentalism, which threatens to spread ever closer to Russia's own borders.
It wants to see the so-called Islamic State defeated and some order restored in Syria, where it has long maintained a strategic interest. It believes Western policy in the region has been self-serving and wildly naive.
Existing regimes have been toppled leaving little more than chaos in their wake.
With the UN General Assembly in New York fast approaching, Mr Putin is eager to embark upon a new initiative on the world stage; one that will highlight Russia's distinctive voice, but one that also will underline what he sees as Moscow's irreplaceable role in the international system.
So seen in this light, the Russian deployment to Syria may already have achieved much of what Mr Putin is seeking.
For a start Russia has demonstrated that it is a strategic player in the region and is prepared to put its military might behind its diplomacy.
It has also demonstrated that its support for President Bashar al-Assad, at least for the short- and medium-term, is solid and a factor with which all other actors must contend.
On the purely diplomatic front, the US has reopened military talks with Moscow. Mr Putin is due to meet President Barack Obama shortly - an encounter that will have been highly unlikely if Ukraine alone was top of their agenda.
Even more significantly, key actors like the Americans and some of their Nato allies, have altered their rhetoric. They are now careful to speak about Mr Assad having no ""long-term"" role in Syria - leaving open what might happen in the short- and medium-term.
There are certainly risks in Mr Putin's military gamble in Syria. But there are clearly opportunities for Russia too. And that is what Mr Putin is counting upon.","With some 24 strike- and close-support aircraft and about a dozen attack helicopters on the ground at its new airbase outside Latakia, Russia is poised to be able to make a significant impact on the fighting in Syria if it so wishes."
"She said, if the party was re-elected in May's Scottish Parliament election, it would introduce a more ""progressive"" local tax from April 2017.
The reforms could see councils given a share of income tax revenues in an effort to give them an ""incentive"" to boost economic growth.
Last year, a commission on reform called for a ""more progressive"" tax.
The Commission on Local Tax Reform did not recommend a single alternative but it suggested there could be merit in combining a property-based levy with an element of income tax.
The current council tax charges householders on the value of the property they live in. The rate it is charged at has been frozen by the Scottish government since 2007.
Speaking at the David Hume Institute in Edinburgh, Ms Sturgeon said: ""The report from the cross-party Commission on Local Tax Reform made clear that now is the time to reform local taxation.
""The commission argued for measures which will make council tax more progressive, and which will give greater assistance to people on lower incomes.
""So next week we will set out details of how we intend to achieve this from April 2017 onwards.
""These changes will be part of a longer term plan to increase the accountability of local councils to the populations they serve.""
Discussions with local authorities are expected to determine how the Scottish Parliament can gain more power over income tax and local authorities can secure a share of income tax revenues for their area.
Asked if councils should be given power over sales and tourism taxes, as recommended by the commission, Ms Sturgeon said priority would be given to the assignation of income tax and other council tax powers would be considered.
""Scotland is a small country and I think it is right that we take steps to incentivise local authorities to boost economic growth in their own areas, but equally I think we have got to be careful about creating a postcode lottery in terms of tax rates in different local authority areas.""","The SNP will set out details of its plans on council tax reform next week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said."

A planned Crossrail 2 connection at Tottenham Court Road will see two new access points built in Soho.
Fry, who is chairman of Save Soho, warned the area ""could change dramatically"".

However, non-league Sutton United's draw against Leeds United, who are third in the Championship, does have a ring of glamour.
Three-time English champions and 1972 Cup winners Leeds were handed a trip to a side 84 league places below them, with giant-killing history and an artificial pitch.
Sutton's current part-timers are aiming to emulate the club's most famous FA Cup moment, which came in 1989 when they beat Coventry City 2-1 in the third round at Gander Green Lane.
Coventry may have now fallen to the foot of League One but back then they were in the middle of a 34-year spell in the top tier, and had won the FA Cup just 18 months before.
""Playing-wise, it was the biggest day I experienced. No other day would come close, apart from the birth of my children,"" Matt Hanlan, the scorer of the winning goal that day, told BBC Sport.
""The fact I am still taking about it all these years later is testament to that upset.""
After dumping out the Sky Blues, Hanlan and fellow goalscorer Tony Rains received national media attention.
""From the minute the game ended it spiralled out of control,"" added Hanlan, now 50 and working in construction.
""On the Sunday, in the days before the internet and Twitter, we had reporters from all the papers round my mum and dad's house.
""To get up and go to work on the Monday morning was a bit of a chore. I was working as a bricklayer and the monotony was broken up by a couple more papers turning up on site.
""At midday we got a call to go home and I then found out the BBC had called and I was required to go on Terry Wogan's show that evening.
""I wouldn't swap a long career in the professional game for the recognition and accolade you get from scoring just one goal - and being part of a team which did something.""
The victory over the Sky Blues has gone down in Sutton and FA Cup folklore. It took 24 years for another non-league side to beat top-flight opposition, when Luton knocked out Norwich in 2013.
However, the current U's side are writing new FA Cup history - to the delight of chairman Bruce Elliott.
The National League club have already knocked out two Football League sides, Cheltenham and Wimbledon, en route to reaching the fourth round.
""Only the FA Cup can get this type of profile for a non-league club,"" Sutton manager Paul Doswell told BBC Radio London.
""It has been a once-in-a-lifetime experience for us. We have been able to create some more recent memories.""
Sign up for the 2017 FA People's Cup and take your chance to win tickets to the FA Cup final and achieve national five-a-side glory.
Members of the 1989 side still keep in touch and several will be in attendance at Gander Green Lane on Sunday, hoping Sutton can make the fifth round for the first time.
""A few of us were there for the AFC Wimbledon game and seven or eight are coming down for Leeds,"" said Rains, now 56 and a black cab driver.
""The tie depends on what side Leeds put out.
""If they are looking at their Championship game coming up on Wednesday, and getting in the play-offs to get back into the Premier League, there are reasons an upset could happen.""
The fourth round has not been kind to Sutton, with their two previous appearances at this stage ending in heavy defeats.
They were beaten 6-0 by Leeds at this stage in 1970 and, after overcoming the Sky Blues in 1989, the U's went on to lose 8-0 to Norwich at Carrow Road.
Doswell knows the scale of the task in front of his side, and would settle for a replay.
""There are two results I would be in dreamland with; one would be to win but equally as good would be to draw and to go up to Elland Road,"" he said.
""It is a great stadium. I am 50 now and I grew up watching the proper Leeds teams. I have a lot of respect for them.
""What a brilliant experience that would be for the club. We'd take thousands up there.
""That would be the end of the cup run, being realistic - but what a way to go out.""
Doswell is not expecting his players to be overawed against Garry Monk's Leeds - pointing to their previous exploits in the FA Cup this season and the experience among his squad.
Nicky Bailey played in the Championship for Middlesbrough and Charlton, fellow midfielder Craig Eastmond featured for Arsenal in the Champions League in 2010, while striker Matt Tubbs was part of the Crawley side which reached the fifth round in 2010-11 before losing to Manchester United at Old Trafford.
""There are players who have played in bigger games than this,"" said Doswell.
""The Wimbledon game gave us that feeling of what it's like with a sold-out crowd here, with TV and radio. They didn't fall down then.""
Doswell is aiming to use the prize money and broadcasting income from their cup exploits - which is expected to be more than £500,000 in total - to improve the infrastructure at Gander Green Lane, including re-tiling the entrance hallway in the clubhouse.
""The clubhouse and the changing rooms are pretty much the same as when I was there,"" said Hanlan.
""They have done a little bit at a time. I'd suspect their goal is to get into the Football League at some point, but not do it to the detriment of the club.
""They are sensible with what they can achieve and the timescales involved.""
Victory over Leeds and a glamour tie in the fifth round could lead to more than a spot of tiling at Gander Green Lane.
Interview with Paul Doswell by BBC Radio London's Andy Rowley.",This season's FA Cup has not thrown up too many blockbuster minnow-at-home-to-giant ties since the Premier League and Championship sides entered the competition in round three.
"Turley, 26, had spells with non-league Salisbury City and Forest Green before joining Eastleigh in 2014 where he made 49 National League appearances.
""I'm delighted to be finally making the step up to the Football League and I want to take full advantage of this opportunity,"" he told the club website.
""I'm a quick and aggressive player, your typical centre-half really.""
Manager Warren Feeney hopes Turley, who turned down an improved deal at Eastleigh to join the Exiles, is the first of several summer signings.
""We know exactly what we want in terms of mentality and ability,"" Feeney told BBC Wales Sport.
""It might take a few weeks, but we are confident of putting a very competitive squad in place.""

"Mr Osborne, in Brussels for a meeting of finance ministers, said the UK would be ""constructive but firm"" in talks with EU leaders.
The UK has said it will not take part in any EU scheme to relocate migrants travelling across the Mediterranean.
The Home Office said it opposed a ""mandatory system of resettlement"".
The European Commission is to propose that EU member countries take in refugees under a quota scheme in the wake of the deaths of more than 800 people in a single incident when their boat capsized last month.
The United Nations estimates that 60,000 people have attempted to make the journey from North Africa to southern Europe on people smuggling boats this year already.
The Home Office said the UK had a ""proud history"" of granting asylum to refugees from conflict zones and victims of persecution and would continue to support existing search and rescue efforts in the Mediterranean.
But it said its focus was on identifying and detaining people traffickers, improving co-operation between law enforcement agencies and making the removal of illegal immigrants more effective.
""When a new piece of legislation in the area of justice and home affairs - including asylum policy - is proposed, the UK can choose whether or not to participate in it,"" a spokesman said.
""We will not participate in any legislation imposing a mandatory system of resettlement or relocation.""
Prime Minister David Cameron has said he is confident he can secure a ""better deal"" for the UK in Europe, focused on returning powers to the UK Parliament, tightening welfare rules for EU migrants, accelerating the single market across Europe and ensuring the UK is not bound by moves to ""ever-closer union"" with the other 27 EU members.
Speaking ahead of the Ecofin meeting in Brussels, Mr Osborne said no-one should underestimate the government's determination to improve Britain's relationship with the EU and to hold a referendum by the end of 2017.
""We come here with a very clear mandate to improve Britain's relationship with the rest of the European Union and to reform the European Union so that it creates jobs and increases living standards for all its citizens,"" he said.
""We go into the negotiations aiming to be constructive and engaged but also resolute and firm and no-one should underestimate our determination to succeed for the working people of Britain and and the working people of the whole of the European Union.""
Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, has said he will work constructively to try to secure a ""fair deal"" for the UK and other members and has not ruled out changes to existing EU treaties before 2020.
However, other EU governments have said they will not countenance any changes to freedom-of-movement rules, enabling citizens of EU countries to live and work in other nations.
The BBC's Alex Forsyth said that although the prospect of a referendum in the UK was not on the agenda during Tuesday's meeting it was certain to be have been discussed on the sidelines.
And Austrian finance minister Hans Joerg Schelling has suggested a referendum is a way for politicians to ""avoid taking responsibility"".
""I think politicians have to act decisively. And when politicians believe they have to ask the people, it's an indication that they themselves are not willing to make the decisions and carry the consequences,"" he said.
Government sources said their position on the timing of the referendum was unchanged amid reports it could be brought forward to 2016 if negotiations concluded earlier than anticipated and legislation paving the way for a vote passed quickly through Parliament.
""If we can do it earlier we will,"" a No 10 spokesman said. ""There has been no change in the position.
""He (David Cameron) wants treaty change. All the advice that he has had is that treaty change is required, for example in terms of some of the changes that we want to see in welfare.""
As the prime minister completes his cabinet reshuffle, he is expected to confirm who will take the important role of Europe minister.

"But he hopes they will not create pressure to increase salaries in Wales.
There is an agreement which limits the regions bidding for each other's players, however Scarlets faced competition when re-signing centre Scott Williams who was out of contract at the end of the season.
""You've got to be realistic because it is a free market,"" Short said.
""No agreement can constrain someone's ability to look for work, and regions will be ambitious and will have their own player requirements.
""How the financial fallout from that works is part of the regions' agreement, and one would hope that you wouldn't see pressure within Wales to increase salaries because we've got enough to deal with outside of Wales.""
Wales international Williams had been expected to renew his national dual contract (NDC), funded 60% by the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU).
However, the WRU withdrew their offer with union chairman Gareth Davies saying it was because the regions had ""upped the ante"".
Williams ended up signing a conventional deal with the Scarlets.
The NDCs were introduced as a mechanism to stop high-profile players leaving Wales for England and France.
Short was chairman of the regions' representative body - now called Pro Rugby Wales - when they negotiated the deal which funds and governs domestic rugby in Wales.
He said he would not have expected the union to get involved in a bidding war, and backed the dual contracts.
""The union have been excellent in supporting regions in the past year,"" he added.
""The NDCs are working well and everybody should recognise that it's a new concept and will take some time to settle down, but it is settling down well.
""And congratulations to the union - it's been a sea-change in the relationship over the past year or so.""",Scarlets chairman Nigel Short admits it will be hard to stop regions competing against each other for Welsh players.

"Following the veteran entertainer's death last week, they have shared some of their best photos.
The friends met at university in Brighton and started ""doing a Brucie"" when posing for photos on nights out. Their homage to the great man went global when they travelled to the Roskilde music festival in Denmark after graduating in 2007.
""That trip was where the whole idea of taking these photos in various locations around the world came from,"" says Joseph Bradfield, 31.
""We did it a lot through our university days when we were out drinking, but that trip around Europe after graduating, we pretty much took one everywhere we went.
""It became a bit of a thing whenever there was a photo op. It would be, 'Look at the camera, smile, now pull a Bruce.' It just snowballed.""
Perhaps the best ""thinker"" tribute was staged when one of the group, Jeremy Dresner, got married in Canada.
The friends often attract confused looks when striking the pose in countries where Sir Bruce wasn't a big star, Joseph says.
""You do it in the UK and people kind of know what you're doing. They still don't really know why you're doing it but there's at least that glimmer of recognition.
""But whenever we've done it overseas there's always puzzlement on the locals' faces.""
Joseph says the friends - about 10 in all - admired Sir Bruce's approach to his career as well as being fans of his TV shows.
""There's that quote where he said, 'I don't see myself as a singer or a dancer or an actor. I'm an entertainer,'"" Joseph explains.
""That really resonated with us, that approach to life, that you don't have to be the best at any one particular discipline but it's all about the impact you have on other people and entertaining other people.""
The friends decided to gather the photos after the news of Sir Bruce's death broke.
""It's been quite an operation of digging through Facebook photos to find everything,"" Joseph says.

"The embattled Republican, cradling a basket of nachos, says to the fan ""you're a big shot"", their faces inches apart.
The drama unfolded during Sunday's Brewers v Cubs game in Milwaukee.
Mr Christie has the lowest approval ratings in the history of New Jersey, and stoked anger recently by using a beach closed to the public.
The baseball heckler, Brad Joseph, said that after Mr Christie walked past his seat, ""I yelled his name and told him that he sucked"".
""I called him a hypocrite because I thought it needed to be said,"" he added.
Chris Christie has gone from presidential timbre to political punching bag. Such is the tragic fate of the soon-to-be-former New Jersey governor.
It wasn't too long ago that Republican power brokers implored Mr Christie to be their white knight, riding into the Republican presidential nomination contest as Mitt Romney's campaign foundered.
At the time his in-your-face style seemed refreshingly candid and his popularity in Democratic-leaning New Jersey gave him cross-over national appeal.
Then the Bridgegate scandal - the pettiness of the apparent retribution scheme - tarnished his lustre. His idol, Bruce Springsteen, mocked him on late-night television. The media coverage grew more biting.
When Mr Christie eventually did try for the White House, Donald Trump had stolen his brash, unscripted thunder.
F Scott Fitzgerald once wrote that there are no second acts in American lives. That hardly seems the case these days, even for someone with Mr Christie's reputational scars.
He'll always have pugnacious attitude. Now, however, it's less a tool that will help him climb the political ladder than a bit of performance art for the entertainment of sports radio listeners and baseball spectators.
Earlier this month Mr Christie was booed by thousands of baseball fans at New York's Citi Field after he caught a foul ball that had landed in the stands.
Also this month, he clashed on live radio with one of his constituents whom he accused of being a ""communist"" and a ""bum"".
With a 15% approval rating, Mr Christie is considered to be one the least popular state governors in American history.

But Secretary of State Theresa Villiers will say those blocking welfare reform are putting more strain on the budget.
Mr McGuinness travelled to Washington on Monday while Ms Villiers will begin a three-day visit to the US on Tuesday.
She will update members of the US administration, members of Congress and senior figures in the Irish American community on the current political situation in Northern Ireland.
She said her message during the trip to Washington and New York is that the Stormont House Agreement remains the best hope for building a brighter more secure future.
The agreement, signed by Northern Ireland's five main political parties last December, was a wide-ranging deal that addressed some of Stormont's current financial difficulties, after a reduction in its block grant from Westminster.
However, Mr McGuinness' Sinn FÃ©in party withdrew its support for the bill in March because of a row over the implementation of welfare reforms.
The Sinn FÃ©in MLA is due to meet influential Irish Americans, representatives of the US State Department representatives and other senior US officials.
Speaking on Sunday evening, he said Northern Ireland's political institutions were in an ""extremely grave situation"".
""The institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, which have underpinned the Irish peace process for almost two decades, are facing crisis,"" Mr McGuinness said.
He repeated his call for the UK government to change its approach and ensure the institutions are ""politically and economically viable and able to meet the needs of a society emerging from a long and bitter conflict"".

Experts said, their existence was kept secret to ""protect the families"".
Conservationists at WWT Slimbridge have been working to re-establish a population in the region for six years.
But this year is the first time birds from the project have successfully reared chicks.
Damon Bridge, of the Great Crane Project, said: ""We're delighted - success has always been about seeing birds raised in the wild take flight.
""To have young on the wing in Somerset and at Slimbridge so early on is really fantastic.
""The cranes are long-lived birds with many breeding attempts ahead of them and we are well on our way to our target of 20 breeding pairs in the South West by 2025.""

He told supporters: ""This inspiration that's been the last 100 days doesn't end on Saturday. Saturday is simply one staging post in it.
""We change politics in Britain, we challenge the narrative that only the individual matters... and instead we say the common good is the aspiration of all of us.""
The MP said he looked forward to Saturday with ""interest, if not some anticipation"".
Ahead of the event, the bookies' favourite in the contest told Channel 4 News he was not ""scared"" at the prospect of taking on his party's top job.
He also said he was ""extremely confident"" of being able to build a shadow cabinet, saying: ""I've had many discussions with people already about how we are going to take these things forward.""
Mr Corbyn's speech came hours after voting in the Labour leadership closed, bringing three months of campaigning by the candidates to an end.
In an email to supporters, Mr Burnham said he had an ""outside but realistic chance"" of winning the contest, and that getting this far was ""a real achievement"".
BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was seen by some of his supporters as an admission of defeat - but a campaign source said this was ""categorically not"" the case.
Mr Burnham also said ""thousands of ordinary, decent party members are now worried about where we are heading"".
In the closing speech of her campaign, Ms Kendall - who has stressed the need for Labour to appeal to a broader section of the electorate - said she may have been ""too blunt"" at times.
She added: ""But my view is that in politics, as in life, you cannot deal with problems by ignoring or avoiding them.""
The contest has been plagued by internal rows over Labour's direction and concerns that non-party supporters have tried to influence the outcome through the new system allowing people to sign up as a registered supporter for Â£3, entitling them to vote in the election.
There have also been claims from some people that they did not receive their ballot papers in time to vote, but Labour said ballots had been emailed and posted out correctly to everyone entitled to vote.
The party said everyone who had not voted or said they did not have a ballot had received a final email reminder on Tuesday.

The theatre hopes to make 25% of all tickets will be free to 25s and under with a new scheme called Young and Free, funded mainly through sponsorship and philanthropy.
Artistic Director Josie Rourke said: ""I remember very clearly the furore created by the idea of an all-female Shakespeare, when Phyllida Lloyd first staged Julius Caesar with Harriet Walter in 2012.
""Phyllida Lloyd's work with this diverse, all-female company has been genuinely ground-breaking and in the intervening four years, theatre has got into the fast lane of debate and change.

The Terriers had chances to get back in the game but Jamie Paterson dragged a shot just off target from 15 yards.
Ince's shot struck the crossbar before sub Johnny Russell wrapped up the victory with a smart curling finish.

Huddersfield head coach David Wagner: ""Derby had to produce one of their best performances today to be able to beat us and so we can leave the stadium with our head up.
""I think there were only some small key points that decided this game and those were in Derby's direction which is why we lost.

"Ruth Davidson delivered that message during a speech at the Tory conference in Manchester.
She addressed delegates ahead of Prime Minister David Cameron's speech.
Her focus was on the 2016 Holyrood election in which she said every vote for the Conservatives would ""promote Scotland's place"" as part of the UK.
The Conservatives have only one Scottish MP but 15 MSPs at Holyrood.
Speaking at a fringe event at the conference on Sunday, Ms Davidson told activists her party was on track for its ""best ever result"" in next year's Holyrood elections.
There is a new Jerusalem we want to build and we will work towards it every day.""
In last year's independence referendum people in Scotland voted to remain in the UK by 55% to 45%.
In her speech to conference, Ms Davidson said the Scottish Conservatives were the party who represented the two million Scots who chose to back the Union.
She insisted the Tories would target the regional vote in next year's Scottish Parliament elections and she urged people, whatever their party allegiance, to consider giving their second vote to the Conservatives.
Ms Davidson told those gathered: ""I don't want us to be just the party of the technocrat. The grudging vote of competence.
""I want us to be the party of the thinkers, the dreamers, the reformers and the visionaries too.
""The zeal of the missionary, the courage of the pioneer, the ambition to lift our eyes to the horizon and say there's a new Jerusalem we want to build and we will work towards it every day.
""And, more than that. We'll take people with us.""
She added: ""So long as the SNP refuses to rule out another referendum, our message for voters looking to cast that second vote is clear. Whichever party you support, use that vote intelligently.
""And if you're one of the two million people who voted 'No' in last year's referendum, use it as your intelligent vote for the Union.""
Ms Davidson went on to tell conference ""Every cross in the Scottish Conservative box is a vote to promote Scotland's place as part of the United Kingdom we built. And every vote for the Scottish Conservatives will help return a Conservative MSP.""
Ahead of Ms Davidson's address, Scottish Secretary David Mundell spoke to party members.
Mr Mundell said: ""We are stronger and safer together as partners in our UK. That is what just over two million voted just over a year ago, to keep our nations together. It was a 'no thanks' to independence.""
He added that the Conservative Party was in ""the vanguard"" of the No to Scottish independence campaign.
However, Mr Mundell said there could not be room for complacency and ""championing the UK must be a full time job"".","Only the Conservatives represent those in Scotland who want to remain part of the UK, according to the party's Scottish leader."
"The 28-year-old victim, from Liverpool, required surgery for his injuries following Thursday's attack.
He was travelling on the 20.34 GMT service from Liverpool Lime Street to Birmingham New Street when he challenged the group.
He was attacked after leaving the train at Winsford station, Cheshire, at around 21.10.
Det Sgt Matt Davies, of British Transport Police, said: ""Thankfully the victim's injuries are not life-threatening, but he remains in hospital where he has received surgery for his wounds.
""Our investigation into who is behind this attack continues and we have been at the station conducting a forensic examination of the scene, local inquiries and reassurance patrols.
""It is vital we now speak to anyone who was on the 8.34pm train out of Liverpool and witnessed the disturbance in the carriage, as well as anyone else who was in the area of Winsford station at 21:.10 and saw what happened.""
The attacker was in his late 20s and of stocky build. It is believed he was part of a group also consisting of four or five women.
He followed the victim before being repeatedly stabbing him in the groin and upper body.
The victim was taken to safety by another passenger from the train.",A man was stabbed in a station car park after challenging a group throwing objects around a train carriage.
"Officer William Porter, charged with manslaughter, has said he did not call for a medic for Freddie Gray because he had no reason to do so.
A prosecutor said Mr Porter could have easily called for a medic or used a seatbelt in the back of a police van.
Gray died a week after sustaining a spinal cord injury in the van.
His death sparked protests over police brutality, with the city of Baltimore erupting in rioting, looting and arson on the day of his funeral.
Prosecutor Janice Bledsoe said during closing arguments that Mr Porter ""just didn't care enough"" to secure Gray with a seatbelt or call for medical attention.
Mr Porter said he checked on Gray during the stops, and he had no signs of injury.
He is charged with manslaughter, assault, misconduct in office and reckless endangerment and could receive up to 25 years in prison.
Other officers' saying they do not use seat belts on prisoners is not an excuse, she said.
Mr Porter said Gray asked for help getting off of the floor of the van and denied claims that Gray told him he could not breathe.
However Mr Porter did say he hear Gray say something about needing an inhaler upon his arrest.
He said in 200 arrests involving the van, he has never belted a prisoner because the wagon is ""pretty tight"".
""External facts"" show Mr Porter is telling the truth, his lawyer Joseph Murtha said, according to the Baltimore Sun.
Mr Murtha said Gray's death was a ""horrible tragedy"" but that there is no evidence Mr Porter is responsible for it.
Concerned about possible unrest after the verdict, Baltimore is opening an emergency operations centre as the trial wraps up.
Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake has said she is sure city officials are prepared for any protests that may arise.
Five other Baltimore police officers will go on trial in Gray's death. All have pleaded not guilty. They will be tried separately and prosecutors hope to use Mr Porter as a witness in the other trials.","A Baltimore officer on trial over a death in custody has been accused of turning a police van into a coffin on wheels, prosecutors have argued."

Country profiles compiled by BBC Monitoring
Barbados is one of the more populous and prosperous Caribbean islands. Political, economic and social stability have given it one of the highest standards of living in the developing world. As well as being a centre for financial services, it also has offshore reserves of oil and natural gas.
However, the economy took something of a knock in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. The country's public debt rose sharply in 2009-11, mainly because of a slowdown in the tourism and financial services sectors.
Prior to the economic crisis there was a construction boom, with new hotels and housing complexes springing up. The trend accelerated as the island prepared to host some of the key Cricket World Cup matches in 2007.
However, a shortage of jobs has prompted many Barbadians - more often known as Bajans - to find work abroad. The money that they send home is an important source of income.
Most Barbadians are the descendants of African slaves who were brought to the island from the 17th century to work the sugar cane plantations.
Limestone caverns, coral reefs and a warm climate tempered by trade winds are among the island's natural assets. Barbados is relatively flat, with highlands in the interior.","The eastern Caribbean nation of Barbados was historically heavily dependent on the export of sugar as its main revenue earner, but in recent decades the economy has diversified into tourism and offshore finance."
"Kimberley Renicks, 27, is Britain's top-ranked player at -48kg but needs a strong run of results to leap almost 25 places into the world's top 16.
""We budgeted for £20,000 for the full year. We got £8,000 and that's all spent,"" said Louise of her fundraiser.
""Unfortunately, in judo there is only a small amount of funding.""
The Renicks sisters, from Coatbridge, enjoyed high profiles during the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, winning the host country's first gold medals.
However, the battle for funding, combined with recurring injuries, led 32-year-old Louise to retire from competitive judo this summer.
She now combines a part-time job as a sports development officer with coaching her younger sister and helping her realise her dream of fighting in Rio.
Louise sees part of her role as shielding Kimberley, who has returned from a shoulder injury, from the stress of finding money for flights and accommodation, with the duo using a crowd-funding website.
Money from Judo Scotland, who are allowing Louise to help with her sister's programme up until the Olympics, will cover Kimberley's costs in January but Louise feels British Judo should be doing more to help in the months that follow.
""The British trials are in two weeks' time and it will be Kimberley's last competition of the year,"" she said.
""Even getting the number one spot, she will be hoping British Judo can provide something.
""I know that January competitions are covered so it's February and March competitions that we need to worry about.
""Even taking the British number ones for the girls and the boys in the seven weight categories, that's 14 athletes but only eight athletes get that funding.
""Money might go to athletes in other weight categories with a slightly better record.
""[Since the Commonwealth Games] money went up in certain areas but it's not gone up so much in the elite side to give athletes a wage to be able to live and pay for competitions.
""It's still quite low there, but in the development side, the recreation side, the active side, all that has gone up in Scotland.
""It's hard to go to the Olympics and get your dream.""
The sisters targeted an initial six events to boost Kimberley's ranking points, but she lost in the first round of the first two, then picked up two bronze medals before two last-16 finishes in Grands Prix.
""Out of the 500 points she needed, she came away with just over 120 so we need in the 300 mark,"" said Louise of her sister's Rio target.
The Renicks' travels for ranking points in the coming months will take in 12 competitions and will include destinations such as Cuba, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, plus some in Europe.
""I'm going to the other side of the world to fight the athletes that, if I do qualify, I will come up against at the Olympics,"" said Kimberley. ""You have to learn how to fight their style.
""It's a full-time job but you don't get paid for it. That's the hardest bit. But walking away from Rio with a medal would be a dream come true.""",Louise Renicks is concerned that a lack of funding will shatter her sister Kimberley's dream of competing for Britain's judo team in the Olympics.

"A photographer who was able to board the stricken wooden vessel said more than 1,000 migrants had been crammed aboard.
They were among at least 28 migrants who died in the area on Tuesday, while some 4,655 people were rescued.
The total number rescued over the past two days is more than 10,000, while the death toll is at least 50.
Smugglers have taken advantage of calm weather to push more boats out to sea.
Aris Messinis, a photographer for the French AFP news agency, said many of the dead aboard one particular boat had suffocated.
He said: ""It was a wooden vessel and there were about 1,000 people on three levels. I counted 22 bodies and there are still others in the hold.""
Mr Messinis's graphic images showed the bodies of dead young men and women, piled on top of one another on the deck of a dinghy and in the cramped hold of a wooden boat.
On Monday, 6,055 migrants were rescued - one of the highest numbers in a single day - and 22 found dead,  Italian and Libyan officials said. One Italian ship rescued about 725 migrants from a single rubber boat, the coastguard said - just one of 20 rescue operations that day.
Relatively calm weather is contributing to a surge in the number of people attempting to make the crossing before the cold weather sets in.
The surge takes the number of migrants who have arrived in Italy this year to about 142,000 and the death toll to about 3,100, according to the International Organisation for Migration.
The majority come from African countries, including Nigeria, Eritrea, Guinea, Gambia, Sudan, Ivory Coast and Somalia.
European law says migrants must stay in the country where they first enter the EU. With fewer migrants able to travel into Europe via Greece and the Balkan route, and France, Switzerland and Austria effectively closing their borders, Italy is struggling to deal with the growing numbers landing on its shores.
Monday marked three years to the day since 366 migrants died when an overcrowded boat sank off the Italian coast, in a disaster that first drew widespread attention to the plight of those attempting to reach Europe by sea.",More than 20 migrants are said to have suffocated in the hold of an overloaded boat off the Libyan coast.
"At the time Laachraoui was known as ""Abou Idriss"", a lawyer for two of the ex-hostages told French media.
The hostages were freed in April 2014.
Laachraoui and Ibrahim el-Bakraoui died when they attacked Brussels Zaventem airport a month ago. Their bombs and a third in the metro killed 32 people.
The confirmation about Laachraoui's role as an IS prison guard in Syria came from lawyer Marie-Laure Ingouf.
Laachraoui was a 24-year-old Belgian electrical engineer from the Brussels suburb of Schaerbeek. He had links to the jihadists who attacked Paris in 2015.
The French daily Le Parisien reports that Laachraoui kept watch over the four Frenchmen with Mehdi Nemmouche, the jihadist accused of killing four people at the Brussels Jewish Museum in May 2014. Nemmouche is now in Belgian custody.
The Frenchmen - Didier Francois, Pierre Torres, Edouard Elias and Nicolas Henin - spent 10 months in IS captivity. They had been captured in June 2013.
Laachraoui and Nemmouche disappeared at the end of January 2014, according to the ex-hostages.","One of the Brussels airport bombers, Najim Laachraoui, guarded four French journalists who were held hostage by so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria in 2013-2014, the ex-hostages say."

"Ian Stewart, 56, was convicted of secretly drugging and suffocating Ms Bailey in a plot to inherit her near-Â£4m fortune.
Her body was found under their home in Royston, Hertfordshire, last July.
Judge Andrew Bright QC said it was ""difficult to imagine a more heinous crime"".
After the sentencing, the family of Stewart's late wife, Diane, said they supported a police re-investigation into her sudden death in 2010.
Stewart reported Ms Bailey missing three months before her body was found in the ""foul-smelling"" cesspit alongside the corpse of her dachshund Boris.
Murdered author 'more than a victim'
A life shaped by death
Sentencing at St Albans Crown Court, Judge Bright QC said Stewart had spun a ""calculated and callous series of lies"" in a bid to convince police, relatives and friends that his bride-to-be had genuinely gone missing.
Ms Bailey had been ""excitedly making arrangements"" for the pair's wedding while Stewart was ""planning how to kill her, hide her body and explain her disappearance as a case of an anxious woman running off because she could no longer cope with the more stressful aspects of her life"", the judge said.
Stewart, who wooed the widow after meeting her via a bereavement website, employed a ""significant degree of planning and premeditation"" before the killing, the court heard.
During his trial, the prosecution said Stewart had played ""the long game"" in order to inherit Ms Bailey's fortune, made from the publication of more than 20 books.
He plied her with the sleeping drug zopiclone in the weeks leading up to her death, and killed her beloved dog to make his ""wicked lies...sound credible to those who knew her well"", Judge Bright QC said.
As he handed Stewart a life sentence, the judge said financial gain had been the ""principal motive"" for the killing.
""You knew Helen Bailey to be a wealthy woman but were not content with having to share in her wealth as her husband. Instead you wanted it all for yourself,"" the judge said.
""I am firmly of the view that you currently pose a real danger to women with whom you form a relationship,"" Judge Bright QC said.
Ms Bailey penned the Electra Brown series of teen novels, and was also praised for her blog - Planet Grief - in which she talked about the death of her husband John Sinfield.
""The world has lost a gifted author and her family and friends will have to live the rest of their lives with the deep sense of loss your wicked crime has inflicted upon them,"" the judge told Stewart.
As a result of the case, detectives are now re-examining the death of Stewart's wife Diane, who died after an epileptic seizure at the couple's home in Bassingbourn, Cambridgeshire, in 2010.
Stewart, who refused to appear via videolink from prison, was also found guilty of preventing Ms Bailey's lawful burial, fraud and three counts of perverting the course of justice.
He had denied murder, claiming two men called Nick and Joe had kidnapped Ms Bailey in April last year and blackmailed him for Â£500,000.
But jurors took just over six hours to convict him after hearing seven weeks of evidence.
Simon Russell Flint, defending, said during his mitigation: ""The likelihood is, given his state of health, the sentence has a like-effect of a whole-life order.
""There is every prospect and likelihood Mr Stewart will end his days behind bars.""","The ""wicked"" fiance of children's author Helen Bailey, who murdered her and dumped her body in a cesspit, has been jailed for 34 years."
"The regulator's chief executive, Leslie Titcomb, said on Monday she had learnt of the sale of BHS, then part of Sir Philip's Arcadia retail group, through reading the newspapers.
Arcadia's company secretary has written on behalf of Sir Philip saying she was given advance notice of the sale.
The regulator's spokesman said she had known but with too few details.
The spokesman said: ""We did discuss the proposed terms of a potential deal with trustees and the employer, however, we were not given sufficient information at that time to assess the potential impact on the BHS pension scheme.""
He added: ""As we have launched an anti-avoidance investigation we need to take care not to prejudice our case.""
BHS was sold for a Â£1 in March 2015 to a little known group of businessmen called Retail Acquisitions.
It collapsed into administration two weeks ago with debts of Â£1.3bn and two parliamentary committees are investigating it.
The letter to the Work and Pensions Committee and the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee said the regulator had been notified by email on 6 February, 2015 that a decision had been taken to market the sale of BHS.
She was also informed that ""two parties had already expressed an interest in a solvent transaction and that negotiations were ongoing with both of them"", according to the letter.
It goes on to say that later in February 2015, the BHS pension scheme trustees and their advisers were made aware of the terms of the proposed sale and met the proposed purchaser.
The letter also states that Sir Philip understood that the trustees had discussions about the sale with the regulator at the beginning of March.
The regulator then sought an urgent meeting to find out how the proposed sale could affect the BHS pension schemes.
The letter said a meeting between Sir Philip and The Pensions Regulator took place on 4 March, where they were made aware of the ""key terms"" of the sale.
The regulator's spokesman said: ""When addressing the Work and Pensions Select Committee, Lesley Titcomb said that we were not informed of the confirmation of the actual sale of BHS to Retail Acquisitions Ltd until March 11.
""She explained that we were engaged with the trustees and the employer in the weeks leading up to the sale, and that we were aware a sale was a possibility.""
During the lengthy parliamentary session, Ms Titcomb said she was unable to answer specific questions about BHS because of her continuing investigation.
Her team is looking into whether BHS' previous owners had avoided their financial obligations to the pensions schemes.
The letter also responded to questions raised by some MPs about the amount of dividend payments paid out by BHS.
The letter said that a total of Â£423m had been awarded  to directors but that there had been no payments made for the past 12 years.
The payments reflected the ""significant"" profits the business had made for the three years to the end of 2004.
Former Trustees of the BHS pension scheme are due to appear before MPs later this month.","Sir Philip Green, the former BHS boss, says the head of the Pensions Regulator gave MPs ""incorrect"" evidence."

"The allegation by Drew McMaster follows a Sunday Times investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs among elite athletes
The Commonwealth gold medallist, who has admitted taking steroids, made the claims on BBC Radio Scotland.
He said ""at least four"" rugby players and two Edinburgh footballers took drugs.
He told interviewer John Beattie that the former Scotland rugby international would have known four drug users from his playing days.
Explaining why athletes turn to drugs, Mr McMaster added: ""You're single-minded to do everything you can to better yourself within that sport.
""The higher you go up that tree, the more competitive it gets.
""When you're competing at a Commonwealth or world stage... to reach that level and maintain that level you will do anything that you can to basically win.
""That is your state of mind as you come up the ranks because you start off from a certain level and as you go through the various levels to achieve and be successful, you get hungrier and hungrier and hungrier to be successful.
""Therefore the temptation that's put in your way as it were, and you find that it's all around you... over a period of time you do get drawn in.""

He said that he believes very little has changed in sport since the 1980s.
""The only thing that's changed in a large way is the amount of money that's now involved,"" he added.
""People are prepared to take big risks where there's big money.""
Mr McMaster won Commonwealth gold in the 4 x 100m relay alongside Allan Wells as part of the famous flying Scotsman quartet.
Last year he claimed he had secretly recorded conversations with Jimmy Ledingham, the Great Britain team doctor and an Edinburgh GP, who had apparently admitted supplying Wells with steroids.
Allan Wells has strenuously denied the allegations.
In a statement from his lawyer when the claims were made, he said: ""It is denied that any drugs were provided by Dr Jimmy Ledingham.
""It is not true our client had used any banned performance drugsâ€¦ at anyâ€¦ time in his athletics career.""
He has previously criticised his former colleague, saying: ""The truth is, McMaster turned to steroids because I started beating him - and I was not using drugs.""

Police told local media the militants detonated a grenade after failing to escape and to avoid being captured.
The dead are believed to include members of a local jihadist group.
On Saturday six people - two police officers and four civilians - were killed in twin bombings in Sylhet when commandos flushed out another group of suspected Islamist militants.
So-called Islamic State (IS) claimed on messaging app Telegram that it was behind one of the blasts.
In the latest incident on Thursday, police told The Daily Star that the bodies were discovered when a bomb disposal team entered the militants' den after ""disposing of grenades and bombs [which were] lying scattered on the floor"" of the building.
The paper says that the sound of gunfire and explosions could be constantly heard right up until the time the security forces entered the premises.
It is unclear how a child was apparently caught up in the violence.
The BBC's Waliur Rahman in Dhaka says that another suspected hideout in the same north-eastern area has also been surrounded by police since Wednesday.
Meanwhile, law enforcers are also keeping a close watch on a building in the eastern town of Comilla, where a similar raid to flush out militants is imminently expected.
The escalation in violence comes at a time when many in Bangladesh thought security forces had managed to curb Islamist militancy, following the deadly siege on a cafe in Dhaka last year.
Recent suicide attacks on security camps and checkpoints have surprised many.
IS has claimed to be behind at least two other incidents this month, including one at a checkpoint near Bangladesh's international airport and one involving a man who tried to cross a checkpoint run by an elite police unit.
However, Bangladeshi police maintain that an offshoot of the banned Islamist outfit Jamiatul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) is responsible for many of these attacks, despite claims to the contrary by IS and al-Qaeda.","Up to eight people including a child were killed when suspected Islamist militants blew themselves up after being surrounded in a hideout in north-eastern Bangladesh, police say."
"Malcolm Fyfield has suffered severe post traumatic stress disorder since surviving the flooded Gleision drift mine in September 2011.
He told Swansea Crown Court the only sign of water near the point being mined was ""ponding"" on the ground.
Mr Fyfield and owners MNS Mining Ltd deny manslaughter charges.
David Powell, 50, Charles Breslin, 62, Philip Hill, 44, and Garry Jenkins, 39, died when 650,000 gallons of water rushed into the area they were working in after they blasted into a flooded old section of the pit.
Mr Fyfield managed to escape and spent 12 days in hospital recovering from a broken hand and bruising and swelling as a result of a ""near-drowning experience"".
The former mine manager insisted he had not inspected the wrong part of the mine and said he was sure he was not mistaken because of the angle and gradient of the underground road.
The jury was told Mr Fyfield also suffers from ""survivor guilt"" and certain words used to describe the flooded mine trigger a feeling of being back in the pit.
Elwen Evans, QC, defending, told the court that ""ponding"" water found in the area before the controlled explosion was not unusual and Mr Fyfield did not think it was particularly significant.
Miss Evans reminded the jury Mr Fyfield was working alongside the men, adding: ""It would have been incredibly reckless to make the breakthrough at a location he had not inspected, putting at risk the lives of four men as well as his own.
""We are dealing with someone whose reputation was as sky high as it comes.
""Year after year he did everything by the book. He knew how to do it, but this time he did not? It does not make sense.""

"In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, they said early schooling was causing ""profound damage"" to children.
They are calling for more emphasis in the curriculum on learning through play.
England's Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said starting school later would damage attempts to close the achievement gap between rich and poor.
The signatories to the letter, including academics, teachers and some writers and charities, said the current system focused too much on formal education, such as the ""three Rs"", at too early an age.
They said national policies should be reassessed to make them more similar to education systems in Scandinavia.
In Northern Ireland, the statutory age of entry to school is four.
In England, Scotland, Wales, Cyprus and Malta, the age is five.
The statutory age is six in Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, Romania, Republic of Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Romania,  Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland and Turkey.

The letter said children who entered school at six or seven ""consistently achieve better educational results as well as higher levels of well-being"".
It was signed by 127 experts including Lord Layard, director of the Well-Being Programme at the London School of Economics; senior lecturer in psychology of education at Cambridge University Dr David Whitebread, and director of Play England Catherine Prisk.
Another of the signatories, former Children's Commissioner for England Sir Al Aynsley-Green, said: ""If you look at a country like Finland children don't start formal, full-scale education until they are seven.
""These extra few years, in my view, provide a crucial opportunity, when supported by well-trained, well-paid and highly educated staff, for children to be children.""
The letter was sent by the campaign group, Save Childhood Movement, which has launched a campaign called Too Much, Too Soon.
Group founding director Wendy Ellyatt said: ""Despite the fact that 90% of countries in the world prioritise social and emotional learning and start formal schooling at six or seven, in England we seem grimly determined to cling on to the erroneous belief that starting sooner means better results later.
""There is nothing wrong with seeking high educational standards and accountability, but there is surely something very wrong indeed if this comes at the cost of natural development.""
Currently most children in England go to nursery at the age of three or four before starting school in the September following their fourth birthday and spend a year in reception class.
Legally all children in England have to be in full-time education by the term after their fifth birthday.
Education Minister Elizabeth Truss rejected calls for formal schooling to start later in England, saying this would damage the life chances of children from poorer homes.
""I think the campaign is wrong-headed,"" she told The World at One on BBC Radio Four.
""At the moment we've got one of the biggest gaps between the performance of low-income and high-income students. And if schooling were to be delayed, that would mean that it was even later that we started working on closing that gap. And I think that's a massive problem.""
Earlier, a source close to Education Secretary Michael Gove had told the Telegraph the authors of the letter were ""misguided"".
""These people represent the powerful and badly misguided lobby who are responsible for the devaluation of exams and the culture of low expectations in state schools,"" he said.
By Angela Harrison Education correspondent, BBC News
The age at which children should start formal schooling has been hotly debated for many years.
This campaign and letter to the Telegraph has added potency because it comes as the government in England consults on whether to bring in a new assessment of children as soon as they start in reception classes.
At the moment, teachers check children's abilities across a range of areas in their reception year, but under the proposed changes this check would be carried out earlier and used as a benchmark.
It was floated as an idea by the head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, who said there was a need for a more reliable assessment of children when they started school so that their progress could be better measured as they moved up and left schools.
At the same time, there are calls for more flexibility over the school starting age in Northern Ireland, where pupils start at four.
Supporters of a move towards a later start, point to the differences around the world and in particular to Sweden and Finland, where the legal age for starting school is seven.
Children in those countries typically enter formal schooling later than those in the UK, but they have usually been in a nursery or kindergarten where they have been learning through play and games.
Earlier this week, Northern Ireland Education Minister John O'Dowd indicated he was willing to introduce new rules to allow flexibility on the school starting age.
Researchers said Northern Ireland had the lowest statutory school entry age in Europe, at four.
In England, the government is consulting on whether to bring in what it calls a ""simple baseline check"" at the start of reception, from which children's progress could be measured for league table and Ofsted inspection purposes.
It would also show parents what progress their children made in the early years of primary school, it says.
At the moment, children are assessed by their reception class teachers at some point in the year but the results are not used formally in accountability measures such as league tables.
The progress children make at primary school is currently measured formally from the results of national (Sats) tests in English and maths taken by children at the age of six or seven and their teachers' assessment of their abilities.
Government officials say a move to an earlier ""baseline check"" is just one option they are consulting on.
Five- and six-year-olds also have a phonics check on their reading abilities at the end of Year 1.","Children should not start formal school lessons until the age of six or seven, a group of educationalists has said."

"And far from the mood since the general election easing on the matter of ""sound money"", the word among senior figures in the department is that now is the time ""to hold our nerve"".
Sources close to the chancellor point out that plans to balance the books - meaning that the government only spends as much as it receives in revenues, mostly in taxes - have already been delayed three times since 2010.
The present target is for the deficit - that difference between government income and expenditure - to be eliminated by 2025.
Philip Hammond wants to maintain that plan.
He sticks to a pretty well-known script when asked about increasing public spending.
Government wealth, he says, comes from three main areas.
The first is taxes - which, it is pointed out, the chancellor tried to increase in March, only for plans to raise national insurance contributions to be abandoned when it was revealed that it breached the Conservatives' 2015 manifesto pledge not to increase income tax, national insurance or VAT.
Is increasing taxes any more palatable now?
Second, borrowing - which the chancellor makes clear means increasing the amount of money that needs to be paid back by future generations.
And, finally, an increase in the ability of the economy to create wealth - called productivity.
It is this last area that is the most important and, conversely, the least open to direct government intervention.
The Treasury - as much as it might want to - cannot simply demand that the private and public sector becomes more efficient at delivering goods and services.
It takes time, money and training in skills - none of which the UK has a particularly proud tradition in.
And anything that is done by the government - such as increasing investment in infrastructure projects like digital broadband or new railway links - takes a long time to feed through to stronger wealth creation, higher economic growth and higher government tax receipts.
It is in within such classically ""Treasury"" parameters that Mr Hammond would like to see the present debate on increasing public spending considered.
Today, pressure is growing from Cabinet ministers such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove for the government to relax its approach to the public sector pay cap, as my colleague Iain Watson reports.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that every 1% increase in public sector pay would cost between £1.5 and £2bn a year.
A pay rise for more than five million public sector workers who have seen their real incomes squeezed in the majority of years since the financial crisis is not cost-free.
And private sector workers on average still earn 3% to 4% less than public sector workers - although their wages are now rising more rapidly and the gap is closing.
Two of the major pay review bodies - for the NHS and for schools - have reported increasing problems of recruitment and retention in their sectors.
That warning is likely to be repeated by the schools review body when it reports later this month.
Last July, it said: ""If current recruitment and retention trends continue, we expect an uplift to the pay framework significantly higher than 1% will be required to ensure an adequate supply of good teachers for schools in England and Wales.""
The police pay review body, also expected to report imminently, sees fewer pressures.
""The general picture on officer recruitment and retention remains healthy,"" it said last year.
""There are also no issues on the quality of applicants, the number of joiners is meeting requirements and attrition rates are stable.""
It does, however, say that ""motivation and morale"" remain a problem.
The Treasury knows it is in a difficult position - and must be heaving a sigh of relief that the health service pay review body is not due to report until next spring.
Abandoning the pay cap would certainly go some way to alleviating the standard-of-living squeeze felt by so many people.
And would be politically popular for a lot of people.
But Mr Hammond will have plenty of other pleas for increased funding to listen to.
What spending demands might flow from the Grenfell fire tragedy?
Should teachers' pay be increased, or is it more important to focus on raising per-pupil funding?
Tackling both adds to the bill which someone - the Treasury argues - has to pay now, through higher taxes, in the future, through higher borrowing or via further cuts elsewhere.
Such trade-offs are the stuff of politics - and the stuff of Budgets, the next of which is not due until November.
Mr Hammond might prefer a period of silence from colleagues on spending commitments until then.
But, with Parliament finely balanced and a prime minister relying on the good will of others to keep her in power, he knows he is not going to get it.",The Treasury jealously guards its role as keeper of the public purse.
"The campaign is expected to be a head-to-head between MSPs Kezia Dugdale and Ken Macintosh.
Mr Macintosh has launched his campaign with a promise to shake up the party organisation, including moving the headquarters from Glasgow to Edinburgh.
He said Scotland must be more accountable and responsive to the needs and wants of Scottish people.
Ms Dugdale will launch her leadership campaign on Saturday. She has said she will offer the party a fresh face and fresh thinking.
Mr Macintosh said that if he became leader he would begin negotiations with the new national Labour leadership to establish a formal relationship with Scottish Labour that recognises its autonomous role within the UK party.
He said that was one of several fundamental changes to the way Scottish Labour operates that were needed before the party could win back voters' trust.
The MSP for Eastwood's reforms would include:
Launching his leadership campaign at the headquarters of East Kilbride and District Engineering Group Training Association, Mr Macintosh said: ""I want to make it quite clear - I see myself as the change candidate.  Yes we could manage the situation we are in.  We could lurch from election to election as we have done in the past.
""But I want to change the whole way the Labour Party operates. I want to move away from the machine politics of the past, to give the party back to its members and to the people we want to represent.""
He added that his leadership would seek to assert the ""identity, authority and autonomy of the Scottish Labour Party"".
""I've never been interested in standing for Westminster and I don't look over my shoulder or seek permission to say what I want to say on behalf of the people of Scotland.
""The Welsh Labour party seems to have had no difficulty in establishing its own identity, with significantly less devolved power or responsibility than we enjoy here in Scotland.""
He said: ""We will be entirely in charge of our own affairs and our own decision-making, but it is important to us that we have a partnership of equals with party colleagues in the rest of the UK.  As I heard it described recently, our future will be one of both self-rule and shared-rule.""
On his plan to move the party's head office to Edinburgh, he added: ""It is time the structure of the Labour Party reflected that the focus of political attention in Scotland is Holyrood.
""This will be the head office - we will opt in to the Labour Party, we will choose to be members of something bigger, but control rests with members here in Scotland.""
He said he was committed to devolution and wanted to devolve responsibility within the party to eight regions reflecting the list regions of the Scottish Parliament, with membership and campaigning organised at that level.
Speaking about his plan to put all elected representatives on an equal footing within the party, he said: ""I want to broaden our appeal, not narrowly focus on an ever declining audience of Scots with so-called traditional Labour values; not solely concentrate on former industrial heartlands in the central belt, but reach out to every place and part of Scotland.""
Three candidates are expected to campaign for the deputy leadership role: Glasgow City Council leader Gordon Matheson and MSPs Alex Rowley and Richard Baker.
The hustings period begins on 22 June and the result will be announced on 15 August.
The elections were sparked after leader Mr Murphy and his deputy Ms Dugdale resigned from their positions.
The changes at the top of the Scottish party come in the wake of Labour losing all but one of its 41 seats in Scotland in May's general election.
Following changes pushed through by Mr Murphy before his departure as leader, the election for both the leader and deputy leader will be based on one-member-one-vote.
All the contestants will take part in a series of hustings at four venues:
The results of the two contests will be announced at a special gathering on Saturday 15 August.

""The majority of people said to me: 'We understand that the flags have gone up, but we also understand that they will come back down again'.

Mrs Virginia - a yoga teacher who comes from the New York area - said she expected to be personally attacked by Mr Trump, but felt it was her ""duty as a woman, as a mother, a human being, and as an American citizen to speak out and tell the truth about what happened to me"".
""Perhaps he will label me just another nasty woman"", Mrs Virginia added.
Mr Trump, at the final televised presidential debate in Las Vegas, called his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton ""such a nasty woman"".
Speaking at a press conference in Los Angeles alongside her lawyer Gloria Allred, Mrs Virginia recounted her alleged encounter with Mr Trump when she was 27 years old.
She said she was waiting for her hire car to arrive when Mr Trump approached her and made comments about her physical appearance to a group of men he was with.
""He said: 'Hey look at this one. We haven't seen her before,'"" Mrs Virginia tearfully recounted, saying that his words described her ""as though I was an object rather than a person"".
""Then his hand touched the right inside of my breast. I was in shock. I flinched.""
She told reporters that Mr Trump then said to her: ""Don't you know who I am?""
""I felt intimidated and I felt powerless,"" she said, explaining that the incident left her feeling ""ashamed"" and that she blamed herself for many years.
Mrs Allred - who is a vocal supporter of Mrs Clinton - insisted that her legal office was not working in co-ordination with the Clinton campaign, and that Mrs Virginia had sought her help to announce the accusation.
She said that there were no corroborating witnesses to the incident, but that Mrs Virginia had recounted the story to friends soon after, and also later to her husband.",A tenth woman has come forward to accuse US presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual assault.
"Team Pacific Rowers were taking part in a race between California and Hawaii when their vessel began taking in water about 100 miles from shore.
Rower Sam Collins, 25, from Cornwall, said: ""It's really frustrating because we are a great team and it is only the equipment which let us down.""
The rowers were airlifted to safety by US coastguards on Saturday.
Mr Collins, Fraser Hart 34, from Tunbridge Wells, James White, 36, from London and Colin Parker, 36, from New Zealand, were taking part in the Great Pacific Race.
The Pacific Rowers team set off on Wednesday to row 2,400 miles (3,862km) from Monterey in California to Honolulu.
Former BBC Guernsey journalist Mr Collins said: ""The first couple of days were great. Team spirits were good. We were getting used to life on the boat.
""But the sea conditions were quite rough and worsening.
""Then late in the second day, out at sea, we started realising that water was permeating into the cabin.
""It just got worse and worse.""
The crew used an electric bilge pump to keep the problem at bay but the water kept coming in.
Water eventually got into all the internal lockers and the boat was so low in the water that waves were crashing over it continuously, Mr Collins said.
""The boat had been through severe testing but in some places it was permeating through the side of the boat because of the force of the waves,"" he added.
The team called for assistance and a support boat reached them 10 hours later.
But with waves of 20ft (6m) and gale-force winds, it was decided that the safest rescue was by coastguard helicopter.
In darkness, a helicopter winched the crew to safety.
""I cannot talk highly enough about the coastguards,"" he said.
The team is now considering entering the 2016 event.
""We are very disappointed, a lot of effort went into this,"" said Mr Collins.",One of four rowers rescued from the Pacific said extreme weather conditions had exposed weaknesses in their boat.
"The SPFL has set up a working group to examine the issue of unacceptable conduct.
And it is understood that they would seek financial assistance from the Scottish government.
The facial recognition system was mentioned at a meeting of all 42 clubs on Tuesday.
The debate over the extent to which clubs should be held accountable for the conduct of their followers has been sparked by recent incidents involving Rangers, Celtic and Dundee United supporters.
Hibernian's visit to Ibrox on 28 December was marred by sectarian chants from the home end, while there were complaints of sectarian songs during Celtic's Scottish Cup trip to Stranraer.
Celtic and Dundee United have both condemned their own fans for setting off pyrotechnics.
SPFL board member Mike Mulraney revealed there was not appetite to introduce new strict liability rules.
The Alloa chairman said there is ""no chance whatsoever"" of clubs agreeing to regulations that could see them punished for the conduct of supporters regardless of whether the club itself is to blame.
A spokesman for the league body said: ""The SPFL is working with government and other partners with the aim of establishing a workable solution to help rid our football grounds of unacceptable conduct.
""This work is at an early stage and is not being led by any one club.
""The issue of unacceptable conduct is something that the SPFL, its board and its member clubs are absolutely committed to addressing.
""Recognising that certain behaviours are for society to face and address as a whole, we believe football can take a leading role in moving this issue forward for Scottish society.""
The prospect of facial recognition technology has been met with scepticism from the Scottish Football Supporters' Association.
Chairman Simon Barrow said the fans' group is concerned by ""a rushed move towards intrusive surveillance"".
He added: ""There needs to be careful consultation with fans and clubs, alongside wider consideration of how to deal effectively and proportionately with threatening and insulting behaviour.
""The best way forward will involve working with the great majority of supporters who deplore such abuses, rather than making them feel under accusation themselves.""",The Scottish Professional Football League is considering the use of facial recognition technology at stadiums to help combat anti-social behaviour.

"Since George Osborne applauded Google's tax agreement with HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) two weeks ago, public sentiment has been mounting against what many feel are unduly favourable tax arrangements for the world's multinationals.
In front of MPs, Google's president for Europe, Matt Brittin defended the company's UK tax arrangements.  Its public stance has been that:  ""Governments make tax law, the tax authorities independently enforce the law, and Google complies with the law.""
In which case, the authorities in the UK and beyond seem to be concluding that what's required is a change in the law.
Chancellor George Osborne has already instigated a clampdown on the way multinationals shift their profits to different jurisdictions to pay less tax, known as the ""diverted profits tax"".
HMRC has said that the new tax, which came into effect in April last year, is aimed at capturing tax from organisations that don't pay corporation tax on their profits in the UK.
Google, says HMRC, has paid the taxes that it is supposed to pay.
Which, say critics, suggests this new tax doesn't go far enough.
Last month, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) successfully brokered an agreement designed to improve the current system.
All 31 of its member countries, which include the US, Bermuda and Guernsey, have agreed to share information on the tax international firms pay, leaving them less room for moving their profits into low tax jurisdictions.
But the plan would still require implementation at national level.
At the heart of the agreement is the concept of transparency, in particular what is known as ""country-by-country reporting"".
This would force companies to tell the tax office of each country in which they operate, how many staff they employ there, what their revenues and profit are and how much tax they pay.
The European Commission has proposed EU member states do the same.  If its plan is approved, which experts say is unlikely as any direct tax measures require unanimity, it could eventually be turned into law by individual countries.
The Commission has said it is also looking separately at whether these accounts should be opened up to public scrutiny and will publish its findings in the spring.
If such scrutiny were ever implemented, it could be a powerful incentive for firms to change, says Richard Murphy, professor of international political economy at London's City University.
""If multinationals feel that they are out of the public eye, then they feel they can carry on the same way with the tax authorities - and nothing changes.
""It is only by having their affairs in the public eye, when everyone can see the choices they are making and the press can have a field day, that you have behavioural change.""
The prospect is already making investors nervous, according to Prof Murphy:
""Investors are crucial to this. They are beginning to question which companies are free-riding. If there is public scrutiny of their accounts that represents a real risk, it could result in a real change in perception of those companies.""
Momentum appears to be building behind this idea. Even the UK government, having been criticised in the past for dragging its feet on the issue, has come out in favour of full transparency, with the chancellor telling the Financial Times he would like to see tax information made public as long as it can be agreed multilaterally.
However some in the business community are concerned.
""We recognise need for greater transparency and we share the common objectives to tackle fraud and evasion,"" says James Watson of the lobby group Business Europe which represents national business associations such as France's MEDEF and the UK's CBI.
""But we are concerned at initiatives that might make the EU a forerunner and create a competitive disadvantage.
""If companies feel they have to reveal more information and information that is commercially sensitive, that might damage the EU as an investment destination if the EU were to go ahead unilaterally.""
For some, though, even the powerful incentive of greater transparency doesn't go far enough - they are calling for an overhaul of the system and the introduction of ""unitary taxation"".
This is a more radical solution to the problem that beset the UK while trying to tackle Google's tax affairs.
Google claimed that all its sales came out of Ireland, with the UK representing one of many marketing operations, and that it therefore made very little taxable profit in the UK.
But unitary taxation would see a company, however big, and however diverse, as one unit with one base and one profit.
Once the revenues and profits are added together they would then be broken down to represent the interests in each country, and the company would be taxed according to its activities there.
The European Commission has proposed a unitary tax system called the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB), while both the US and Canada already have a form of unitary taxation for their corporations' domestic profits.
Sol Picciotto, emeritus professor at Lancaster University Law School, says treating multinationals as single entities makes sense, but that it can be difficult for countries to agree on how they work this out.
The most obvious formula, he believes, is to base taxation of profits on where a firm's assets, employees and sales are located.
""I think there must be some kind of change.
""The direction must be towards treating multinationals as single entities. Up until now they have been seen as a collection of independent entities, and I think that is a mistake,"" he says.","When Google's European boss, Matt Brittin, appeared before the House of Commons' Public Accounts Committee on Thursday he faced a wave of indignant questioning from MPs."
"Around 180,000 wills are written by non-lawyers every year, and are exempt from the complaints handling body.
But a report by the Legal Ombudsman has called on the government to open up their services to those using non-regulated providers.
A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said more could be done but more regulation was not necessarily the answer.
A spokesperson said: ""When people write a will it is extremely important for them to have peace of mind that their affairs will be dealt with how they want them to be.
""That is why we have agreed with the Legal Services Board that there is room for improvement in this area.
""However we are not convinced that regulation is the best way forward - we believe other options should be explored first, including better guidance for professionals and making better use of existing consumer information and protection.""
The Legal Ombudsman's report claimed that wills and probate were the third highest source of received complaints, and that the market was ""suffering from a number of quality issues"".
It concluded that ""all consumers of wills and probate service providers should have access to redress"".
The Ombudsman helped resolve more than a thousand wills and probate related complaints last year.
Excessive costs, delays and a failure to follow instructions were some of the common problems faced.
But the independent body is only allowed to take on wills drawn up by regulated service providers.
It said that a lack of regulatory oversight meant that customers could be left with no options if they were ""ripped off by the service provider"".
Chief Legal Ombudsman Adam Sampson said: ""Wills can be prepared by anyone in principle. For people on a budget, this creates headaches about the standard of service one could reasonably expect.
""It also means some people will have access to help if things go wrong, while others won't.
""We want the government to at least consider a voluntary ombudsman scheme into which service providers can opt themselves. Provision already exists for the Lord Chancellor to make this happen.""
Claims for mishandling a deceased estate rose three-fold in 2013, with 368 claims lodged in 2013  compared with 107 in the previous 12 months, according to figures from the Chancery Division.
Last year, Justice Secretary and Lord Chancellor Chris Grayling rejected the advice of the Legal Services Board to make will writing a reserved legal activity.","The regulation of wills should be reformed to prevent people being ripped off, the Legal Ombudsman has warned."

"Roy Burke said the expiry of an agreement with Dutch company Verweij and Partners meant no-one now had exclusive rights to work on the site.
The company had originally pledged to start redeveloping Fort Tourgis by the end of 2012.
Plans for the Victorian fortification include a hotel and conference centre.
Mr Burke said: ""Verweij and Partners no longer have exclusivity on Fort Tourgis... nobody has the right to build or develop Fort Tourgis.""
He added: ""If they come along with plans tomorrow, the States of Alderney would have to relook at those plans and decide whether or not they want to proceed with that development.""
Verweij and Partners entered into negotiations with the States of Alderney in 2007.
The company submitted plans for a resort, which would include spa facilities and 50-70 bedrooms.
Mr Burke said any development would need to involve much work to the inside of the fort, due to the fact that many of the floors have rotted and collapsed.
He said: ""Virtually all the original features will have to stay.
""From an economic perspective there's no doubt it will be a great boon for Alderney.""
Mr Burke said he would be meeting a representative of Verweij and Partners in a few weeks, and was expecting an update on the development.
He said following an announcement earlier in the year that part of the company had been declared bankrupt, he was examining its finances.
Attempts to contact Verweij and Partners were unsuccessful, with the company's phone lines in the Netherlands appearing to have been disconnected.","An agreement on the redevelopment of Alderney's derelict Fort Tourgis has lapsed, according to the chief executive of the island's States."
"It has also been struggling with a stubbornly strong Australian dollar. A rate cut usually weakens a currency.
The rate cut is the second since October and came after the Reserve Bank of Australia's monthly policy meeting.

""The urgency to actually find a replacement for mining investment has become quite acute,"" said Brian Redican of Macquarie Bank.
Mr Redican said more action will be required from the Reserve Bank of Australia.
""In 2013 there will be further aggressive rate cuts, although there is nothing in this statement that suggests that the Reserve Bank is thinking along those lines.""
Demand for Australian commodities has meant that its economy has remained buoyant during the recent global slowdown whilst Europe and the US have slowed down.
However, that demand mainly from China is beginning to taper off as the slowdown starts to hurt Asia as well.
Prices for Australia's commodities have fallen as a result and the value of its exports has been reduced.
The strength of the Australian dollar is also causing problems for the economy hurting sectors such as tourism and manufacturing.
In a statement on Tuesday, central bank governor, Glen Stevens, said the dollar remains ""higher than might have been expected"" given lower export prices and a weaker global outlook.
The Australian dollar is above parity with the US dollar.

"It follows a refusal by ministers to underwrite the Ebbw Vale project.
The Heads of The Valleys Development Company said it has put forward two alternative options with revised commercial terms for its backers Aviva and two local councils.
Ministers were asked to provide a 100% guarantee but rejected it as too risky.
The Heads of The Valleys Development Company, behind the project, said it had put forward two alternative options with revised commercial terms.
""These alternative arrangements will reflect a more balanced financial support package for both the public and private investment parties,"" said chief executive Michael Carrick, who added private financiers would take a share of the risk.
So a guarantee by Welsh Government could be less than 80% of the project compared to the 100% that was rejected on Wednesday.
He said no public money would be tied up underwriting the circuit while it was being built.
In the worst scenario afterwards, the Welsh Government would own the land and the assets.
Mr Carrick said the deal was already there with leases, construction contracts and guarantee agreements ""ready to go"".
""This is a small nuance on an existing deal that we can look to put in place relatively quickly,"" he told BBC Wales.
""There are challenges around internal and government approvals to a structure like this - it's not something we can do imminently. We're not looking months but four, five or six weeks to be able to do this.""
The race track and related developments aims to eventually create 6,000 jobs.
On Wednesday, Economy Minister Edwina Hart said there was a ""significant question around the viability of the project"" and an ""unacceptable risk"" to the government underwriting the entire project.
Mrs Hart said she had ""reluctantly come to the conclusion"" not to proceed with the guarantee after legal advice.
The Welsh Government has already in effect spent around £9m in supporting the development, which Mrs Hart said had not been wasted, and included feasibility studies.
The minister said she ""did not want to close the door to it all, just close the door on this stage of it"".
The stumbling block came when ministers were asked to underwrite the whole of the private sector investment.
First Minister Carwyn Jones said the problem emerged in the ""last few days"" and they could not take on board an enormous risk to taxpayers.
""It would mean effectively a bill of £100 for every man, woman and child if things went wrong,"" he told BBC Wales.
""Any rational government is going to ensure there is not an unacceptable risk to the people of Wales.""
All sides seem to still want to make this happen, as part of regenerating the area.
Earlier in the day, Circuit of Wales said it would continue working with Welsh Government, local authorities and Aviva investors to take the project forward in a way that is acceptable to all sides.
Blaenau Gwent Nick Smith MP said there had been major difficulties since  the project was first unveiled past four and a half years ago but he still hoped it had a future.
""The Welsh Government was clear about what the difficulties were but I studied (its) letter carefully and it said it was open to a different way forward.

The demonstration was small - just a few hundred people - but emotions were running high.
There has been a great deal of anger in Nigeria because many have the impression that the government is doing far too little to secure the release of the teenage girls who are believed to be in the hands of the Islamist extremist group, Boko Haram. Parents of the abducted students have been left to rely on rumours as officials have said very little.
In the pouring rain, people marched to the National Assembly and delivered their message to the politicians themselves. The Senate President David Mark was there. He told the drenched crowd that the military must do everything within its means to rescue the students.
More rallies are due to be held over the next few days. Some here are determined that the plight of the missing school girls is not allowed to be ignored by the political elite - many of whom send their own children to schools overseas far from the vulnerable students of north east Nigeria.
The protest, labelled the ""million-woman march"", had been called by the Women for Peace and Justice organisation.
March organiser Mercy Abang told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that the government should do whatever is necessary, even if it meant holding negotiations with the abductors, to make sure the girls returned home ""alive - not in body bags"".
Anger has mounted in recent days over the abductions. Parents have criticised the government's search and rescue efforts and the number of missing girls has been disputed.
Nigeria's Interior Minister Abba Moro told BBC Focus on Africa that he understood the ""outpouring of emotions"", but the government could not divulge details of what it was doing to secure the release of the girls.
It had to act in a ""discreet"" way because the militants had threatened to kill the girls if ""certain steps"" were taken, he said.
He accused opposition parties of politicising the crisis and said they should work with the government rather than criticise it.
Another march organiser, Hadiza Bala Usman, told the BBC the women wanted to know why soldiers seemed so ill-equipped to find the girls.
She warned that the abductions would discourage parents from sending their daughters to school in an area where few girls are given an education.
Saruta, a woman from Chibok, told the BBC's Newsday that the community was desperate for help.
""For how long are we going to wait for the government to help us? We can't bear it anymore. We can't,"" she said, breaking down in tears.
On Tuesday, a local official said some of the girls may have been taken to neighbouring states and forced to marry the militants.
Swathes of north-eastern Nigeria are, in effect, off limits to the military, allowing the militants to move the girls towards, or perhaps even across, the country's borders with impunity, says the BBC's Will Ross in Abuja.
The students were about to sit their final year exam and so are mostly aged between 16 and 18.
Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau first threatened to treat captured women and girls as slaves in a video released in May 2013.
It fuelled concern at the time that the group was adhering to the ancient Islamic belief that women captured during war are slaves with whom their ""masters"" can have sex, correspondents say.","Hundreds of mainly women protesters have marched through the Nigerian capital, Abuja, to press for the release of 230 schoolgirls abducted by militants two weeks ago."
"As well as allowing robots to quickly respond to potential damage to their systems, it could also protect humans who are increasingly working alongside them.
The scientists plan to base the system on ""insights from human pain research"".
To test it, they fitted a robotic arm with a fingertip sensor that could detect pressure and temperature.
The researchers, from Leibniz University in Hannover, are developing a system that would allow a robot to ""be able to detect and classify unforeseen physical states and disturbances, rate the potential damage they may cause to it and initiate appropriate countermeasures, ie reflexes"", they explained.
Just as human neurons transmit pain, the artificial ones will pass on information that can be classified by the robot as either light, moderate or severe pain.
Researcher Johannes Kuehn told IEEE Spectrum: ""Pain is a system that protects us. When we move away from the source of pain, it helps us not get hurt.""
Teaching robots about a range of stimulus is important, robotics expert from Cambridge University Prof Fumiya Iida told the BBC.
""Getting robots to learn is one of the most challenging things but is fundamental because it will make them more intelligent,"" he said.
""Learning is all about trial and error. When a child learns that falling over causes pain, it then learns to do it with more skill.""",Researchers from Germany are developing an artificial nervous system aimed at teaching robots how to feel pain.
"Lt Donald Mackintosh, who served with the Seaforth Highlanders, died in the Battle of Arras in 1917.
His actions led to the posthumous award of a Victoria Cross.
Arras was fought from 9 April to 16 May 1917 and marked the beginning of the spring offensive on the Western Front.
An unusually high number of Scottish soldiers took part in the battle and 18,000 of them were killed.
The official citation marking Donald Mackintosh's VC reads:
""For most conspicuous bravery and resolution in the face of intense machine gun fire.
""During the initial advance he was shot through the right leg, but though crippled he continued to lead his men and captured the trench.
""In the captured trench Lt. Mackintosh collected men of another company who had lost their leader, and drove back a counterattack.
""He was again wounded, and although unable to stand, he continued, nevertheless, to control the situation.
""With only fifteen men left, he ordered his party to be ready to advance to the final objective, and with great difficulty got out of the trench and encouraged his men to advance.
""He was again wounded and fell.
""The gallantry and devotion to duty of this officer were beyond all praise.""
Lt Mackintosh was just 21 when he was killed.
British artillery had attacked German lines with heavy shells in preparation for the advance at Arras.
But many German machine-gun positions remained intact.
British units, including The Seaforths, suffered massive losses as they attacked.
In many cases, more junior officers like Mackintosh were expected to rally soldiers whose company commanders had already fallen.
By the time the Battle of Arras ended, the Allies had suffered 159,000 casualties, 46,000 of them Scots.",A memorial stone has been laid in Glasgow to honour a World War One officer who led a successful advance while so badly wounded he could not stand.
"Baroness Nuala O'Loan, who was Northern Ireland's first police ombudsman, said the issues must be dealt with separately.
She said victims were being held ""to ransom"" during the political stalemate.
""If you choose between the ability of people to get prosthetic limbs and welfare reform, that to me is totally morally wrong,"" she said.
Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, she accused both the Westminster government and Stormont's devolved government of failing to play their part in resolving ongoing problems caused by the Troubles.
Baroness O'Loan said victims who had conflict-related injuries were not getting the financial support needed because of the budget row over welfare reform.
""We have people today who are suffering a great deal, we need resources and we need progress on the past in order to enable the present,"" she said.
The former police ombudsman also said ongoing sectarian violence was the result of failure to deal with Northern Ireland's troubled past.
""People can think that we're at peace, but we had three deaths last year, we had 94 shootings, we had 26 bombing incidents, 58 firearms recovered. We still have a state of conflict and we need to work as a society towards reconciliation.
""The British government need to play their part and our own government need to play their part and I don't think either are doing it at the moment.""
Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt said Ms O'Loan's ""argument"" had ""some merit"".
""At the start of the Haass talks two years ago, I argued that we should steer well clear of this formula, and bank agreements as we progressed,"" he said.
""I made the same pitch at the start of the Stormont House process, sadly without success, and as a result, victims and survivors once again find themselves in limbo, listening to rumours of the possibility of real progress in service provision, but unaware of the real prospects for actual delivery, not least in the area of better mental health and wellbeing.""
Mr Nesbitt said Ms O'Loan's intervention had come ""hot on the heels"" of speculation in a media briefing that the UK government was considering implementing singular aspects of the agreement.
""This all has the whiff of softening up the public for a side deal being brought forward over and above the heads of the five Executive parties,"" he said.
""Our concerns over side deals was one of the reasons the Ulster Unionist Party felt unable to fully support the Stormont House Agreement last December, and as time passes, the wisdom of that decision appears to strengthen by the day.""
The Westminster government had agreed a number of new measures to address Troubles legacy issues during last December's Stormont House Agreement.
However, the deal has been in jeopardy since March, when Sinn FÃ©in withdrew its support after a row over how future welfare claims would be dealt with.","It is ""immoral"" for the government to refuse to deal with Troubles legacy problems unless welfare reform is agreed, a former watchdog has said."

The Somali Islamist militant al-Shabab group has been targeting Kenya over the deployment of Kenyan forces to Somalia.
Most of the victims were youths including returnees from Somalia who had surrendered after the government promised them amnesty, Haki Africa's report said.

"Kenneth Gibson and his wife Patricia - the MP for North Ayrshire and Arran - lost their baby towards the end of her pregnancy in 2009.
Staff at the Southern General hospital in Glasgow had failed to spot that Mrs Gibson had pre-eclampsia.
A review of baby deaths at Crosshouse Hospital was announced on Tuesday.
It came after a BBC Scotland investigation revealed that there had been six so-called ""unnecessary"" deaths of babies at the hospital since 2008.
""Unnecessary"" or ""avoidable"" deaths are referred to as those where harm was caused to a healthy baby during childbirth - usually resulting in them being deprived of oxygen.
Reports into some of the deaths referred to failings in monitoring of the child's heartbeat during childbirth.
Speaking in the Holyrood chamber, Mr Gibson urged Health Secretary Shona Robison to make the review ""wider and deeper"" so it could look at similar cases in other hospitals across the country.
His wife has previously opened up in the House of Commons about the ""devastating"" effect of losing her baby.
Mr Gibson said: ""On her due date in 2009, my wife Patricia, having been sent home and been physically sick, was finally admitted to the Southern General maternity unit despite their protests.
""A consultant junior doctor and two midwives examined her that day. Despite being 41, a first-time mother and in extreme pain from head to toe, no-one picked up her pre-eclampsia. She was given morphine and put to bed.
""Overnight our baby died and had to be delivered by caesarean. Patricia's liver ruptured and she spent 19 days in intensive care and high dependence.""
Mr Gibson said the couple had spent 20 months asking NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to explain how they would prevent such a failure of care reoccurring and impacting other lives.
He added: ""They blanked us and when we were thereby forced to take legal action, hired a QC, wasting thousands in taxpayers' money to defend the indefensible.
""It took five years before they eventually conceded this year. What will the Cabinet secretary do to ensure other people in Ayrshire, Glasgow and elsewhere in Scotland are not treated as badly when they experience such a tragedy?""
Ms Robison said she sympathised with the Gibsons' ""appalling"" experience, adding: ""We would expect all health professionals to treat anyone who has suffered any bereavement with care, dignity and respect.
""Clearly that didn't happen in that case and we should learn the lessons from that case.""
Labour MSP Anas Sarwar raised figures from the BBC investigation, which showed that Scotland's maternity hospitals had recorded more than 25,000 adverse incidents since 2011.
The figures, released under freedom of information legislation, showed the most serious incidents included the deaths of 26 newborns and three mothers, as well as 79 stillbirths.
Mr Sarwar called for the review to be extended to look at staffing across all maternity units in Scotland, highlighting 500 incidents relating to staff shortages.
The health secretary responded by saying NHS Scotland met the Royal College Of Midwives' recommended midwife-to-birth ratio, and patient safety programmes had resulted in the lowest levels of stillbirth and neonatal deaths on record as well as a decrease in maternal deaths.
She added: ""In those really, really significant adverse events, the worst kind, we have seen huge progress being made through that patient safety programme so that it is fair to say that our maternity and neonatal units are safer now than they were four or five years ago.""",An SNP MSP has spoken about the loss of his child as he urged Scotland's health secretary to widen a review into baby deaths at a Kilmarnock hospital.

"A total of 28% had not talked about the symptoms, the University of Aberdeen paper revealed.
Lead author Dr Peter Murchie said it highlighted the complications surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis.
Cancer Research UK said it was a complex area.
The study - published in the British Journal of Cancer - said that, of those who had previously flagged symptoms to their doctor, 81% had been appropriately referred on by their GP for further treatment or investigation of their symptoms.
However it said 19% could be viewed as missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis.
The study, funded by the Scottish Chief Scientist's Office, involved a review of the case notes from 1,800 patients diagnosed with cancer in northern Scotland and registered at GP surgeries across NHS Grampian, Orkney and Shetland.
Dr Murchie, a GP and researcher at the University of Aberdeen, said: ""This study sheds light on the complications surrounding emergency cancer diagnosis and how quickly circumstances can change for the patient.
""It's vital we do more to ensure people with persistent or unusual symptoms feel confident about getting them checked out by a doctor without delay.
""And it's equally important to give GPs better access to the tests and specialist advice they need to help them spot potential cancer symptoms at the earliest stage.""
Jodie Moffat, Cancer Research UK's head of early diagnosis, said: ""For some patients, emergency presentation may be difficult to avoid, but for others there are often things that could have been done differently.
""Studies like this help us to understand this complex picture and identify what needs to change.
""Cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency are more likely to have late stage disease and poorer survival. So it's vital we do all we can to break down barriers to people visiting their doctor with symptoms that could be cancer.
""Cancer Research UK is also working with GPs in Scotland to help improve early cancer diagnosis and ensure they have the freedom to refer patients for further tests and access specialist advice if cancer is suspected.""","More than a quarter of cancer patients diagnosed as an emergency in the north of Scotland had not discussed any relevant symptoms with their GP beforehand, according to a new study."

"A year ago, he was a member of the government of one the most unpopular French presidents in history.
Now, at 39, he has won France's presidential election, defeating first the mainstream centre left and centre right and now the far right as well.
No doubt about it, Mr Macron was carried to victory in part by the winds of fortune.
A public scandal knocked out the initial frontrunner, centre-right candidate François Fillon; and Socialist candidate Benoît Hamon, already on the left fringe of the party, suffered a very public drubbing as traditional voters looked elsewhere.
""He was very lucky, because he was facing a situation that was completely unexpected,"" says Marc-Olivier Padis, of Paris-based think tank Terra Nova.
Luck doesn't tell the whole story.
Mr Macron could have gone for the Socialist ticket, but he realised after years in power and dismal public approval ratings the party's voice would always struggle to be heard.
""He was able to foresee there was an opportunity when nobody could,"" says Mr Padis.
Instead, he looked at political movements that have sprung up elsewhere in Europe - Podemos in Spain, Italy's Five-Star Movement - and saw that there was no equivalent game-changing political force in France.
In April 2016, he established his ""people-powered"" En Marche! (On the move) movement and four months later he stood down from President François Hollande's government.
Having established En Marche, he took his cue from Barack Obama's grassroots 2008 US election campaign, says Paris-based freelance journalist Emily Schultheis.
His first major undertaking was the Grande Marche (Big March), when he mobilised his growing ranks of energised but inexperienced En Marche activists.
""The campaign used algorithms from a political firm they worked with - who by the way had volunteered for the Obama campaign in 2008 - to identify districts and neighbourhoods that were most representative of France as a whole,"" Ms Schultheis says.
""They sent out people to knock on 300,000 doors.""
The volunteers didn't just hand out flyers - they carried out 25,000 in-depth interviews of about 15 minutes with voters across the country. That information was entered into a large database which helped inform campaign priorities and policies.
""It was a massive focus group for Macron in gauging the temperature of the country but also made sure that people had contact with his movement early on, making sure that volunteers knew how to go door to door. It was a training exercise that really laid the groundwork for what he did this year,"" Ms Schultheis explains.
And he capitalised on it.
Mr Macron's political persona appears beset with contradictions.
The ""newcomer"" who was President Hollande's protege and then economy minister; the ex-investment banker running a grassroots movement; the centrist with a radical programme to slash the public sector.
It was perfect ammunition for run-off rival Marine Le Pen, who said he was the candidate of the elite, not the novice he said he was.
But he dodged attempts to label him as another François Hollande, creating a profile that resonated among people desperate for something new.
""There is a very prevalent pessimistic mood in France - in a way, too pessimistic - and he comes with a very optimistic, positive message,"" says Marc-Olivier Padis.
""He's young, full of energy, and he's not explaining what he'll do for France but how people will get opportunities. He's the only one to have this kind of message.""
Up against his more optimistic tone, Marine Le Pen's message came across as negative - anti-immigration, anti-EU, anti-system.
Macron campaign rallies featured brightly lit arenas blaring with pop music, says Emily Schultheis, while Marine Le Pen's mass meetings involved protesters throwing bottles and flares, a heavy police presence, dark audience stands and an ""angrier"" undercurrent.
The big TV debate on 3 May was an angry affair, with a string of insults hurled by both sides.
She was a ""grand priestess of fear"", a snake-oil merchant from the same extremist background as her father. He was a Socialist puppet, a dangerous tool of global finance who would do whatever Germany's Angela Merkel asked.
But many were alarmed by the prospect of a potentially destabilising and divisive far-right presidency and saw him as the last obstacle in her way.
Marine Le Pen may have run a highly effective campaign, but her poll ratings have been on the slide for months. She was ahead in the polls last year, nudging 30%, and yet in just two weeks she has been beaten twice by Emmanuel Macron.

"Mr Le Roux told a news conference that he felt it was his ""responsibility"", but denied wrongdoing.
It is alleged that his daughters were being paid for work while involved in other activities.
The Socialist minister has repeatedly insisted that the summer jobs were legitimate.
French President Francois Hollande said he had accepted Mr Le Roux's resignation and named Trade Minister Matthias Fekl as his successor.
Centre-right presidential candidate Francois Fillon is already under investigation for employing his family.
That probe has now been widened to include possible forgery and aggravated fraud, French media report.
Investigators are looking at whether Mr Fillon and his wife Penelope forged documents to try to justify the €700,000 ($755,000; £610,000) she was given for work as a parliamentary assistant that she is alleged not to have carried out.
Now Le Canard Enchaine newspaper - which broke the allegations about the jobs for Mr Fillon's family -  has reported that a Lebanese billionaire paid a firm owned by Mr Fillon $50,000 for helping to arrange a meeting in 2015 with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Total's CEO Patrick Pouyanne.
Mr Fillon's campaign team told the AFP news agency that ""the suspicions of conflict of interest are totally unfounded"".
Initially the favourite to win the presidential election in April and May, Mr Fillon is now running third in the opinion polls.
In normal times this would be a monumental embarrassment for the French government. The interior minister has been found employing his two daughters as parliamentary helpers, and paying them a lot of public money.
There may not legally be anything wrong with what he did - though the prosecutor will need to check that out thoroughly - but the look of the thing is awful.
While still at school, these daughters of the French nomenklatura were able to start very substantial savings accounts.
It would be embarrassing - but in fact the Socialist government is worse than a lame duck. It is a duck with both legs snapped at the knee. In the upcoming presidential elections, it has no representative. In a few weeks it will simply disappear.
So the resignation of a minister is minor news. Except perhaps for Francois Fillon, who can hope to extract a little comfort from the discomfiture.
Mr Le Roux, 51, said he did not want the investigation into the contracts linked to his daughters to ""undermine the work of the government"".
""I've made it a point of honour to respect my title as a deputy, and all the responsibilities that come with it,"" he said, adding: ""I have always been honest in my relationships with others and in all my political actions.""
His daughters began working for him when they were 15 or 16, and between them amassed 24 fixed-term contracts that paid out €55,000 ($60,000; £48,000).
The allegations against Mr Le Roux surfaced in the Quotidien TV programme on Monday, when a reporter approached the minister asking about holiday jobs he had paid his daughters for between 2009 and 2016.
Employing family members is common practice in France's National Assembly and is lawful. However, the programme reported that two of the contracts coincided with an internship and a pre-study course.
One daughter held a three-month internship during the summer of 2013 at Belgian company Yves Le Rocher, Quotidien reported.
Mr Le Roux's office said all the jobs the girls were paid for were completed.
""Of course I had my daughters working with me particularly during the summers or other school holidays, but never permanently,"" he told Quotidien.","French Interior Minister Bruno Le Roux has resigned over a ""fake jobs"" row involving work he gave his two daughters when they were teenagers."

The court heard Ms Sands befriended the pensioner and regularly cooked for him but on learning about the charges went to advise him to plead guilty to avoid the children having to testify.
She said she had drunk two bottles of wine and a small bottle of brandy before visiting Mr Pleasted's flat on 28 November and took a kitchen knife, hammer and wrench with her ""for safety"".
She told the Old Bailey that when Mr Pleasted opened the door he ""smirked"" and said his accusers were liars.
Ms Sands told the court: ""He was so cold. The man that I thought I knew never behaved like that.

Meanwhile, Castleford Tigers have claimed they should receive £500,000 in compensation after Sale signed winger Denny Solomona, who has scored four tries in four games since his rugby union debut.
Solomona was under contract with the Super League outfit until 2018 but left them to sign a three-year deal at Sale.
Cas have launched legal action against the Sharks, Solomona and his agent Andy Clark.
""They openly said we'd made them an offer which was substantially more than what Warrington Wolves had offered them and they rejected that,"" added Diamond.
""We feel vindicated by what we have done as we signed a player after he resigned and they'd sacked him.
""Castleford's claim is 10 times what he was earning. Maybe they should have thought of that and paid him what he is worth one would suggest.""","Sale have yet to speak to England and Bath fly-half George Ford over a potential move, says Sharks director of rugby Steve Diamond."
"The news continued the club's dismal week after Tuesday's confirmation that their 12-point Premiership deduction would remain following a failed appeal.
A day later, Portadown conceded two late goals to lose 4-3 against Crusaders in the League Cup.
""I believe the time is right to step away - I've done all I can to move the club forward,"" said McGibbon.
After serving an interim boss following long-serving Ronnie McFall's resignation in early March, former Manchester United defender McGibbon was appointed manager in late April.
However, six weeks later Portadown were handed a 12-point deduction for this season's Premiership after an Irish FA disciplinary committee ruled that they had paid player Peter McMahon even though he had been registered on amateur forms.
Portadown were already facing a transfer embargo in addition to being fined £5,000 because of a further registration breach involving Gary Twigg.
The Shamrock Park club were handed a total ban from all football related activity in late July for a failure to pay the £5,000 fine and their first scheduled league game of the season against Coleraine on 6 August was postponed.
Portadown appealed against both penalties but their pleas were rejected by an Irish FA appeal panel last Tuesday.
""As a former player both at youth team and first team level, I am devastated to see the current state of the club,"" added McGibbon.
""Recent events have had a demoralising effect on players, management and supporters alike.
""Despite player restrictions and ongoing administrative issues, I have been working hard with Vinny, the players and the rest of the management staff to improve fortunes on the pitch.
""However, I have found that my roles and responsibilities have been taken up more as a general manager than from a first team management perspective.

The result meant the tie finished level at 2-2 on aggregate, with Zimbabwe qualifying on the away-goals rule.
It was disappointment for Cameroon who represented Africa at the Women's World Cup in Canada, reaching the second round.

He said the branch handled Â£400m from 16,000 customers, with 6,000 in Guernsey and 2,000 to 3,000 in Jersey.
The spokesman said a factor in the decision was the high cost of operating in an offshore banking centre.

"Some 853,000 16- to 24-year-olds were NEET at the end of 2015, down 110,000 on the same quarter of 2014.
But the figures also show the numbers were 5,000 higher than in the summer.
City and Guilds managing director Kirstie Donnelly said it was ""worrying"" to see the figures ""creep up after months of more positive news"".
The Office of National Statistics figures date back to October to December 2001 when 833,000 young people were classified as NEET, some 12.9% of the total age-group.
At the end of last year that proportion had fallen to 11.8%.
NEET numbers reached from highs of over a million, or more than 16% of the age-group, in 2011, but have fallen consistently since.
In England, the government raised the education participation age to 17 in September 2013 and to 18 in September 2015.
So young people in England are now expected to stay in full-time education, in an apprenticeship, or in employment with training until they are 18.
The UK-wide NEET figures first dropped below the million mark, to 987,000, or 13.5% of the age group in the first quarter of 2014.
England-only figures show there were 690,000 NEETs at the end of last year, almost 100,000 fewer than in the last quarter of 2014.
This figure is the lowest since 2000 when comparable records began and the number stood at 629,000, says the government.
Skills Minister Nick Boles said the figures showed the government was delivering on its commitment to ensure all young people were either earning or learning.
""There is no room for complacency, though, and through our plans to deliver three million new apprenticeships by 2020 and our qualification reforms, we are determined to build on these excellent results,"" said Mr Boles.
But campaigners say the figures are still too high
""More than one in every 10 teenagers is currently locked out of a path to the future,"" said Ms Donnelly.
And Jenny North, policy and strategy director of Impetus PEF, which funds projects to help the most disadvantaged young people, called for more government action.
""We need to see a clear focus from government on how they will help disadvantaged young people succeed in education, and progress into sustained employment so they can fulfil their potential,"" said Ms North.","The number of young people not in education, employment or training (NEET) is at its lowest for the time of year since 2001, UK-wide figures show."
"The Nasa probe, which flew by the dwarf planet in July, continues to downlink its data, and as it comes in, the scientists get to work on it.

""This'll really take time to figure out; maybe it's some combination of internal tectonic forces and ice sublimation driven by Pluto's faint sunlight,"" the Washington University, St Louis, scientist said in a US space agency release.
The best way to look at ""scales"" is to browse the new high-resolution enhanced colour view of Pluto that has been made available (PNG file, 70MB).  The features are on the far eastern edge.
This super image comes from the Ralph/Multispectral Visual Imaging Camera on New Horizons. It combines blue, red and near infrared (NIR) images.
The enhanced view will help decode the various geological and climatological processes that have worked together to produce all the complex surface features seen on Pluto.
Alex Parker, a team member from the Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, worked on the Ralph portrait.
""This image consumed the better part of this week for me,"" he tweeted.
""I removed striping noise and deconvolved the images, massively improving sharpness.
""Since the NIR, red and blue images used to make this colour composite are taken separately, they have to be precisely aligned in software.
""The instrument is a TDI (time delay and integration) camera, and has funny spatial distortions. I removed all of these by hand to create the final colour product.""
Also released this week are probably the highest-resolution images seen so far.
They come from the Lorri camera and show details down to 270m across. Lorri is a black and white camera, but the imagery released by Nasa has been coloured with Ralph information.
The mosaic includes a segment of so-called Sputnik Planum. Incorporating a series of large polygonal features, in previous releases the icy surface has appeared to be ultra-smooth. But in this new higher-resolution view, it is possible to see a more dune-like and pitted texture.
New Horizons continues to move deeper into the outer Solar System even as it downlinks its flyby data.
It has now gone 90 million km beyond the dwarf, which puts it very nearly five billion km from Earth.

"Shares of the state-owned firm and its units were up between 16% and 42%.
The IPO was the biggest in the world this year and the largest since Alibaba's record $25bn deal in 2014.
It also marks the Japanese government's largest asset sale in nearly three decades.
The listing is part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plans to boost the flagging economy by encouraging consumers to invest in the stock market.
About 10% of each company was sold to the public in the largest privatisation of a state-owned firm since Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in 1987.
The government allocated 80% of the shares to domestic investors, with the remaining 20% sold to international institutional investors.
Japan Post Holdings opened at 1,631 yen per share, 16.5% above the IPO price of 1,400 yen. The banking unit started at 1,680 yen, up almost 16% from its IPO price, while the insurance unit was 33% higher.

"Tom Donilon - who spent three years as the most senior voice on foreign policy in the Obama administration - was clear. On issues where America dealt directly with the EU, issues like the nuclear deal with Iran, immigration and aid spending, not being present at the EU table would lessen Britain's importance for the US.
But Mr Donilon's overriding concern was not one of specific foreign policy issues it was a broader question of focus. Voting leave, he fears, would lead to a Britain that is more inward looking and more distracted from global affairs.
That, he added, would be a less powerful partner for the US. On a string of critical issues, Britain would be less important to the White House if it were not part of the European Union.
I sat down with Mr Donilon, President Barack Obama's previous National Security Adviser, after he and a group of senior American foreign policy officials signed an open letter urging Brits to vote to stay in the EU on June 23rd.

"The London-wide annual target for new units of affordable housing is 17,000, although councils set their own levels.
Only 8,550 such units were built in developments with affordability requirements in 2015-16 - down from 10,962 the previous year.
Lewisham was the only borough to meet or exceed all its targets over the past three years.
""House prices are rising six times faster than wages and rents [are] sky high,"" said Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter.
He said ""thousands of homeless families in London right now - over 2000 in Hackney alone"" were ""trapped in temporary accommodation because there's nowhere they can afford to live.""
Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, has promised ""thousands of new affordable homes to both buy and rent"".
Under the London Plan, the councils' self-set affordable homes targets range from an overall target of 25% in Croydon to 50% in boroughs such as Hackney, Lewisham, Islington and Camden.
Councils met only two-thirds of their targets in the last three years, and 16 of the 21 councils that responded to the BBC's Freedom of Information request missed their targets every year.
While the number of homes built in developments with affordability requirements between 2013-16 rose, the percentage that were affordable fell from 31.3% to 23.5%.
Councils can require large housing projects with more than 10 units to provide affordable housing under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.
However, they are not doing so and developers are using viability assessments to argue that to provide affordable housing would make the development non-viable, and thus exempt from housing requirements.
Instead, councils are taking payments in kind, with so-called s106 payments (money given to councils to secure planning permission) increasing from £184m to £235m between 2014 and 2016.
Greenwich alone received more than £71m in s106 payments last year - up from just under £10m in 2013-14.
Only a quarter of its new housing was affordable, against a target of 35%.
Mayor Sir Steve Bullock, London Councils' executive member for housing, said planning affordable housing ""can be a complex process"".
""For instance, putting pressure on developers to build higher proportions of affordable housing can result in fewer homes in total being built,"" he said.
""Should developers prove that affordable housing requirements will threaten the viability of an entire project due to market conditions, boroughs try to negotiate a compromise that still benefits their local communities.""
One council, Harrow, did not respond to the BBC's request for data.","London boroughs are failing to ensure developers provide affordable housing, figures obtained by the BBC show."

"Marvyn Iheanacho, 39, attacked Alex Malcolm in Mountsfield Park, Catford, on 20 November 2016.
Witnesses heard a ""child's fearful voice saying 'sorry'"", loud banging and a man screaming about the loss of a shoe, Woolwich Crown Court was told.
Iheanacho, who denied murder, will serve a minimum of 18 years in prison.
The jury heard Alex suffered head and stomach injuries and died in hospital two days after the beating.
His mother, Lilya Breha, 30, told the court Iheanacho had also attacked her after she tried to call an ambulance when he returned to her flat carrying her injured son.
In a tearful interview, she said: ""He (Alex) was bubbly. He was just perfect you know, he was a really, really special little boy.
""He was shy, he was so shy, and very polite. He would always say 'Mummy thank you' and 'I love you Mummy'.""
Ms Breha described Iheanacho as a ""good liar"" and pathetic.
Recalling how she met him through a friend after he left prison, she said he had convinced her he was innocent and a good person.
She said: ""When I think about it now, to be honest I feel like it was all such a big lie and he just pretended to be a good guy pretty well.""
Prosecutors revealed there had been ""problems with witness interference"" during the trial, with Iheanacho phoning Ms Breha from prison to try to persuade her to back him in court.

"If only there was a simple way to compare their strengths and weaknesses...
Who's got the most campaign money? Who really electrifies a crowd? What is their Achilles heel?
All your questions are answered - on a candidate card, so you can test the powers of one against the other.
Trump has been tops for so long it's hard to remember what the Republican race was like before he emerged on the scene. The New Yorker has thumbed his nose at political convention, embraced controversial positions that would be radioactive for other candidates, dominated the headlines and kept his opponents perpetually off balance.
He appeals to disaffected Republicans across the board, whether they're evangelicals, grassroots Tea Party supporters or even moderates. It's been an incredible run - but can it hold up once voting starts? He's shown a thin skin and flashes of a temper that, if repeatedly provoked, could eventually prove his undoing.
Dismissed when he launched his campaign last March, Cruz has cruised to the top of the Republican pack thanks to a gift for rhetoric and a campaign strategy that has taken advantage of the anti-establishment mood among conservatives. He's formed a seemingly unlikely coalition of religious voters, libertarians and Tea Party activists.
To win, however, he'll have to fend off attacks from Republican colleagues who overwhelmingly dislike what they see as his me-first attitude.
Rubio looks like a winner. He's charismatic, he has a compelling story as a child of Cuban immigrants, he's generally well-liked by the Republican establishment, and he's run a largely error-free campaign. That probably explains why every candidate not running as an outsider has done everything they can to tear him down.
Rubio is distrusted by grassroots conservatives, however, for his leadership on the 2013 immigration reform efforts that have since become politically toxic. He's the second choice of many Republicans, but he'll have to find an opportunity to break away from his mainstream competitors or risk falling too far behind someone like Trump or Cruz.
Many Republicans practically begged Christie to run against Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination in 2012. That was before he became mired in scandal in New Jersey and turned many conservatives against him for seeming to be too supportive of Barack Obama.
In 2016 his brash, straight-talking New Jersey style has been one-upped by Trump and his limited resources have forced him to set up camp in New Hampshire in the hope that a win there will surge him into national viability.
He has solid political-street-fighting abilities, however, so in a crowded, rough-and-tumble battle for the mainstream Republican vote, he could still claw his way to the top.
Bush once was the man to beat. His huge campaign war chest and solid support within the party deterred Mitt Romney from entering the race and hampered other establishment candidates. He's proven to be a paper tiger, however.
After nearly a decade out of public office, his political instincts seem dulled. He's constantly fumbled with his words, leaving him overmatched against more skilled debaters. His depth of knowledge on policy issues has been no match for Trump's headline-grabbing pronouncements.
His famous last name seems a detriment in the Republican electorate's anti-establishment mood, and moderate positions on immigration and education reform have hurt him with the conservative rank-and-file.
He's burning through money, but he still has plenty of resources. His best hope now is a long, drawn-out nomination fight where he's one of the last few left standing.
Kasich entered the Republican race because he perceived the nominal front-runner, Jeb Bush, to be weaker than at first thought. The Ohio governor has turned out to be only a slightly less flawed version of the man he sought to supplant for the mainstream Republican vote, however.
Like Bush, he isn't trusted by grassroots Republican voters who dislike his perceived heresy on healthcare reform in his state. His sometimes-dour demeanour has hurt him during the high-profile debates, where he's struggled to get attention.
If he has a shot, it's in New Hampshire, where he's in a tight battle with Bush and other more traditional politicians for second place behind Trump.
At one point last year the Carson-Trump outsider duo dominated the race for the Republican nomination. While Trump continues to flourish, Carson has fallen on hard times, however. His soft-spoken personality now seems ill-fit for a campaign that, after the Paris and San Bernardino attacks, increasingly rewards bellicose rhetoric.
He's also been repeatedly criticised for lacking a command of the issues. While he's posted eye-popping fundraising numbers, his campaign operation has been accused of mismanaged finances and beset by staff turnover.
He has a loyal cadre of supporters who believe in his intellect and adore his story of successfully overcoming childhood poverty, but at this point they're all that he has left. He'll need a surprise showing in Iowa, where evangelicals once backed him, to turn things around.
Fiorina turned out to be the surprise of the early Republican debate season, dominating the first undercard debate and emerging as one of the clear winners of the second, prime-time debate. She's never managed to capitalise on that surge of interest, however.
Thanks in no small part to the Trump phenomenon, she disappeared from the headlines for long stretches at a time. Her background as a high-tech corporate executive has left her with no natural political base, and she has seen a steady decline of her poll numbers.
She's once again off the main debate stage - perhaps for good - leaving her scant opportunity to recapture that earlier magic. With limited campaign resources, she's been unable to build much of a ground game in the key states of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Paul was once labelled ""the most interesting man in politics"" and predicted to be a force in the Republican nomination fight. If he could put a more mainstream spin on the libertarian appeal of the past presidential campaigns of his father, Ron Paul, he could carve out enough support to come out on top in a crowded field.
Instead, he seems to have alienated the libertarians, while the Republican establishment suspects his views on national security and foreign policy are too dovish. His fundraising has underwhelmed, as he's failed to attract deep-pocketed donors and the grassroots contributions pale compared to his father's money-generating machine.
He's shown a thin skin when facing hostile media questioning, and while he's offered a contrasting viewpoint during the Republican debates, there just don't seem to be enough Republican primary voters out there who agree with him.
It seems hard to believe, but Santorum won the Iowa caucuses four years ago and amassed enough votes to finish second behind Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination. At the time his combination of evangelical support and working-class sensibilities were an appealing contrast to Romney's corporate gloss for many Republican voters.
This time around, there are simply too many other candidates with more money, more experience and more personality for Santorum to compete.
He's staking everything on another surprise showing in Iowa, but there are no indications that lightning will strike twice.
If Santorum is yesterday's candidate, then Huckabee is the candidate from the day before yesterday. He was the surprise winner of the Iowa caucuses in 2008, running as a good-humoured conservative with a folksy charm.
The former Arkansas governor then eschewed a continued political career for a run as a radio and television talk show host, passing on a chance to run as a favourite in 2012. Now, like Santorum, he's been outmanoeuvred and outgunned by a host of new faces, and he's never been able to gain traction on his old terrain in Iowa or elsewhere.
He's still got the gift for gab, but his jokes are now on display in the undercard debates and his time appears to be running out.","Eleven Republican candidates are doing battle for the White House and after months of campaigning their first electoral test, in Iowa, is just days away."
"Investigators have found signs of metal fatigue in components from the aircraft that crashed off Norway in April, killing 13 people.
The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) said both H225 and AS332 (L2) variants should cease flying.
Iain Stuart from Aberdeenshire was among those killed in the crash.
Mr Stuart, 41, from Laurencekirk, was working for the oil field services company Halliburton and was a passenger on the helicopter.
The Airbus Super Puma 225 was travelling from the Gullfaks field to Bergen when it crashed near the small island of Turoey on 29 April.
The pilots had no time to issue a mayday and the main rotor is believed to have become detached before impact.
On Wednesday a preliminary report issued by the  Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) said it had found ""features strongly consistent with fatigue"" in parts of the main gearbox (MGB).
It added: ""It cannot be ruled out that this signifies a possible safety issue that can affect other MGBs of the same type.
""The nature of the catastrophic failure of the LN-OJF main rotor system indicates that the current means to detect a failure in advance are not effective.""
The Super Puma H225 helicopter had  already grounded in the UK and Norway since the crash but the latest EASA directive includes the other main variant of the Super Puma and extends the ban across Europe.
An online petition calling for all Super Puma 225s to be ""permanently removed from service"" has attracted nearly 30,000 signatures.
Tommy Campbell, chair of the Offshore Coordinating Group (OCG) of trade unions said: ""The Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) report is a further development in the investigation process, but it is just part of that process.
""The OCG will await the outcome of investigations aimed at providing proof around what caused the tragedy in Norway and thereafter we will react to those findings.
""The OCG accepts and fully understands the concerns of our respective members and their families, and the OCG trade unions will continue to support members during this period.
""There is no question of this aircraft type coming back into service anytime soon as a consequence of these latest findings.
""If that position changes, we will engage with our members to determine a position"".",European aviation safety officials have extended the grounding of Super Puma helicopters amid concerns about its gearbox.

"A government order means poultry must be kept indoors until the end of February or kept away from wild birds.
The H5N8 bird flu strain has been found in poultry in Lancashire, Lincolnshire, Carmarthenshire and North Yorkshire.
Under current EU rules, products from poultry housed for less than 12 weeks can be still marketed as free-range.
This 12-week allowance for birds housed owing to avian flu will come to an end on 28 February.
The rules also affects products which contain free-range egg, such as mayonnaise.
Daniel Winter runs Trinity Farm in Nottinghamshire, where he keeps a small flock of about 100 free-range hens.
He needed to build a new covered enclosure for them, costing Â£1,000.
""If it should continue for months, then we'll end up losing the free-range label,"" he said.
His business is trying to avoid putting up the price of their eggs.
""We've been swallowing the cost, hoping it would end, but at some point, we are going to have to start looking at passing the cost on,"" he said.
Ruth Mason, chief food chain adviser at the NFU, said: ""Plans need to be put in place in terms of how eggs can be marketed and how they should be positioned.
""It is very logistically difficult for the industry to move overnight from calling one product free-range to calling it 'barn' or whatever that might be.
""We may well get to a place where we have a free-range packaging that has a sticker over it that explains the birds have been housed, so it may say 'free-range, however, birds are currently housed due to avian influenza'.""
Barn eggs are traditionally cheaper in the shops than free-range eggs.
A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""We have taken swift action to limit the spread of the disease, with restrictions around affected premises and wider measures in place across the country, including a legal requirement for all poultry keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds. This must be coupled with good bio-security.
""All measures will be kept under review based on the best available evidence, and we are working closely with the industry on next steps.""
Similar restrictions have been introduced in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.

"Pollard bowled a big no-ball when Lewis was on 97 off 32 balls, with St Kitts and Nevis Patriots needing one run to beat Barbados Tridents in the Twenty20 competition.
The no-ball gave 25-year-old Lewis' side the win but saw him miss out on the chance of a ton after he and captain Chris Gayle reached 129-0.
Cricket statistician and journalist Mazher Arshad said: ""So Kieron Pollard bowls a no-ball to deny Evin Lewis a hundred in CPL. Suraj Randiv was suspended for a match when he did that to [Virender] Sehwag in 2010.""

But Renfrewshire Council rejected the planning application for the new facility.
As a result, the Home Office said it will retain Dungavel House for people who are facing removal.
The Home Office said it had been ""disappointed"" by the council's decision to block a new holding centre.
It said the Glasgow Airport plan would have created a ""modern and secure facility"" for ""those with no right to be in the UK"".
A spokesman said: ""We always made clear that the closure of Dungavel immigration removal centre was dependent on the opening of a new short-term holding facility in Scotland.
""As the application for a new facility at Paisley was rejected, Dungavel will remain open.""

"The Virginia-based court said the president's broad immigration power was ""not absolute"" and the ban ""intended to bar Muslims from this country"".
The decision upheld a lower Maryland court ruling that found the ban violated constitutional rights.
The justice department said it would now seek a Supreme Court review of the appeals verdict.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the verdict thwarted Mr Trump's effort to protect US national security.
Mr Trump's revised executive order would have placed a temporary ban on people from six mainly Muslim countries and the refugee programme.
The US government argues federal immigration laws grant the president broad powers to stop foreigners from entering the country.
But Chief Judge Roger L Gregory, who wrote the majority opinion for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, said on Thursday that Mr Trump's powers had limits.
""It cannot go unchecked when, as here, the president wields it through an executive edict that stands to cause irreparable harm to individuals across this nation,"" said Judge Gregory.
The court added that the government's national security argument was a ""secondary justification for an executive order rooted in religious animus and intended to bar Muslims from this country"".
The decision means citizens from Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen, Syria and Libya can continue travelling to the US.
The 10-3 ruling is the latest in a series of legal setbacks for an order the president insists is needed to stop terrorists from entering the country.
Two lower court rulings blocked the ban just hours before it was due to begin in March.
A Maryland judge ruled that the order was meant to be a ban on Muslims and violated the first amendment of the US constitution.
A federal judge in Hawaii also sided with opponents that the ban was discriminatory and cited ""questionable evidence"" in the government's argument that the ban was a matter of national security.
The justice department has appealed against the Hawaii decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard oral arguments for the case on 15 May.
The Ninth Circuit is the same court that refused to lift a block on Mr Trump's initial travel ban signed on 27 January.
That order took effect for seven days before a federal judge in Seattle halted it.
Instead of appealing against the decision to the Supreme Court, Mr Trump issued a revised version on 6 March.
Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson issued a statement after Thursday's ruling calling it an ""important victory for the rule of law"".
""I will support challenges to this illegal and unconstitutional executive order as our own case against the travel ban continues in federal court here in Washington.""
Mr Sessions said in a statement that Mr Trump was abiding by the US constitution and was doing his ""duty to protect our communities from terrorism"".
""This Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the power and duty of the Executive Branch to protect the people of this country from danger"", he added.
The controversial ban has prompted protests and debate across the US.
More recently, a North Carolina group of pastors highlighted the issue on a billboard citing the 9/11 attacks in Catawba County.

"A study in the International Journal of Obesity found energy used at rest was 25% lower in 15-year-olds compared with when they were 10 - a fall of 500 calories a day.
This is equivalent to cutting out an hour's strenuous exercise every day.
The study said the findings were unexpected but could help explain why a lot of teenagers put on excess weight.
Most of the energy people burn is just to keep their bodies ticking over - using the brain, heart, liver and kidneys - rather than through physical activity.
In a decade-long study following 279 children, researchers from the University of Exeter Medical School were surprised to find the number of calories the children burned at rest fell sharply during puberty.
This is a period of rapid growth, which usually uses up lots of calories, but it was only around the age of 16 that the number of calories burned at rest started to rise again.
During puberty there was also a noticeable drop in physical exercise, particularly among girls, which could add to weight gain, the researchers said.
About a third of school children aged 10-11 in England are overweight or obese.
Prof Terry Wilkin, from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""Child obesity and associated diabetes are both among the greatest health challenges of our time.
""Our findings can explain why teenagers gain excess weight in puberty, and it could help target strategies accordingly.""
Prof Simon Capewell, vice-president of the Faculty of Public Health, said the findings showed there was an even greater need to improve children's diets and protect them from junk food and sugary drinks.
""Adolescents sitting around using their smartphones and iPads are being bombarded with junk food marketing - while using even fewer calories than we previously thought.
""Last month's government strategy on childhood obesity confirmed the duty on sugary drinks, but was otherwise a disastrous missed opportunity.
""We need much tougher regulation around the marketing of junk food to children - particularly on TV and online.""",A sharp drop in calories burned off while resting during adolescence could be contributing to the rise in obesity.

"It is an anti-government gesture used by protesters in the Oromia region.
Ethiopia's government normally keeps a tight grip on the country and there has not been anything on this scale in the last 25 years.
There has not been a specific trigger and what we are seeing is an accumulation of years of frustration from ethnic groups who say they have been marginalised by the government.
Demonstrations began in Oromia last November. Protests have also sprung up more recently in the Amhara region.
Oromia and Amhara are the homelands of the country's two biggest ethnic groups.
New York-based Human Rights Watch says that more than 400 people have been killed in clashes with the security forces in Oromia, although the government disputes this figure.
The Oromos, who make up around a third of the population, have long complained that they have been excluded from the country's political process and the economic development which has seen the capital, Addis Ababa, transformed in recent years.
The protests were initially over a plan to expand the boundaries of Addis Ababa into the Oromia region.
That plan was dropped, but the demonstrations exposed some underlying issues and protests continued with the latest round taking place on Saturday in many places in Oromia and the capital, Addis Ababa.
At the root of the recent demonstrations in Amhara is a request by representatives from the Welkait Amhara Identity Committee that their land, which is currently administered by the Tigray regional state, be moved into the neighbouring Amhara region.
The Welkait committee says community members identify themselves as ethnic Amharas and say they no longer want to be ruled by Tigrayans.
Amharas used to form the country's elite and the language, Amharic, remains the most widely spoken in the country.
Source: CIA World Factbook estimates from 2007
Observers say that Ethiopia's governing coalition is dominated by the party from the small Tigray region (TPLF), that led the guerrilla war against the military regime of Colonel Mengistu Haile Mariam. Some see both sets of protests as a way of criticising the country's government.
There is no formal connection between the Amhara and Oromia demonstrations but at a recent protest in Gondar, banners could be seen expressing solidarity with people from the Oromia region.
Oromo activists referred to the demonstrations in Amhara in their Facebook post calling for protests on the first weekend in August - when Amnesty International said that more than 100 people died - but highlighted the fact that they thought the protesters there had been treated more leniently.
The central government, a close ally of the West, is in a very powerful position and has total control over the security forces.
There is not a single opposition member in parliament, so it faces no real political threat.
But its reaction to a big protest at the beginning of August suggests that it is worried:  It shut down the internet across the country for two days, fearing that was how the demonstrations were being organised.
There is only one, state-controlled internet service provider so this was fairly straightforward.
Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn then issued a veiled threat to protesters saying that the government was obliged to ensure the rule of law. But he did not specify what that meant in practice.
He also appeared to be concerned that the country was sliding into ethnic conflict, which could become difficult to contain.",Ethiopia's Olympic marathon silver medallist Feyisa Lilesa crossed his hands above his head as he finished the race in Rio - bringing the world's attention to a wave of protests in his home country.
"It was not immediately clear what had happened, with spokeswoman Heather Nauert saying there were no ""definitive answers about the source or cause"".
But Ms Nauert refused to be drawn further on what the symptoms were.
But one source told the Associated Press news agency the symptoms reported included hearing loss.
It was suggested the hearing loss could have been caused by some kind of sonic device placed outside the diplomats' homes, emitting inaudible sound waves that can cause deafness.
Staff began complaining of the strange symptoms late last year, Ms Nauert said.
While they were not life-threatening, she revealed a number of people had been brought home to the US as a result.

Seven of the victims were travelling in the same car.

"The up and down motion can fracture the ice, potentially aiding its break-up and melting, the researchers told Nature magazine.
They say storm swells may have a much bigger influence on the extent of polar sea ice than previously recognised.
The New Zealand-led team ran its experiments off Antarctica.
They placed sensors at various distances from the edge of the pack ice, and then recorded what happened when bad weather whipped up the ocean surface.
For smaller waves, less than 3m in height, the bobbing induced in the floes quickly decayed. But for waves over 3m, the disturbance sent propagating through the pack ice was sustained for up to 350km.
""At the ice edge, it's quite noisy,"" explained study lead author Alison Kohout, from New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in Christchurch.
""You have lots of waves coming from all directions with a full spectrum of frequencies. But as the waves move into the ice, this all gets cleaned up to produce one beautiful, smooth wave of constant frequency,"" she told BBC News.
""The ice floes bend with the waves, and over time you can imagine that this creates fatigue and eventually the ice will fracture. Interestingly, the fractures tend to be perpendicular to the direction of the waves, and to be of even widths.""
Computer modellers have been trying to simulate the recent trends in polar sea ice - without a great deal of success.
They have failed to capture both the very rapid decline in summer ice cover in the Arctic and the small, but nonetheless significant, growth in winter ice in the Antarctic.
Dr Kohout and colleagues say their experiments offer some clues - certainly in the south.
When they compared observed Antarctic marine-ice edge positions from 1997 to 2009 with likely wave heights generated by the weather during that period, they found a strong link.
For example, where storminess was increased, in regions like the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, ice extent was curtailed.
In contrast, where wave heights were smaller, such as in the Western Ross Sea, marine ice was seen to expand.
One very noticeable aspect of the recent growth in Antarctic winter sea ice has been its high regional variability.
The team says that if models take more account of wave heights then they may better capture some of this behaviour.
The group did try to look for a similar relationship in storminess and ice extent in the Arctic but found there to be insufficient data to draw any firm conclusions.
The geography at the poles is quite different. The Arctic is in large part an ocean enclosed by land, whereas the Antarctic is a land mass totally surrounded by ocean. Many of the ice behaviours and responses are different as a result.
""I think what's interesting for us in the Arctic is that the 'fetch' is increasing - the distance from the shores to the ice edge is increasing,"" commented Prof Julienne Stroeve from University College London and the US National Snow and Ice Data Center.
""That would allow the wind to work more on the ocean to produce larger waves that can then propagate further into the ice pack.
""[Another recent paper has already suggested] that wave heights are going to change with increasing distance from the ice edge to the land, and that could have more of an impact on ice break-up.""

"In Virginia, Terry McAuliffe - a key Hillary Clinton ally - narrowly beat a Republican to become governor of the pivotal presidential swing state.
Bill de Blasio's thumping victory in New York makes him the city's first Democratic mayor-elect in two decades.
Tuesday's results point the way to next year's US midterm elections.
New Jersey's straight-talking Governor Christie brushed aside his Democratic challenger, state senator Barbara Buono, by 60.5% to 38%, retaining a handy platform for a potential presidential bid.
His ability to attract the support of Democrats, independents and minorities makes him a tantalising prospect for the ideologically split Republican party ahead of 2016.
By Mark MardellNorth America editor
""We stand here tonight showing that it is possible to put doing your job first,"" said Mr Christie in his victory speech, ""to put working together first, to fight for what you believe in yet still stand by your principles and get something done for the people who elected you.""
The governor, known for his readiness to work with Democrats in a left-leaning state, won much praise for his handling of the carnage wrought on the region by super-storm Sandy one year ago.
However, fellow Republicans at a national level lambasted him for his embrace of Democratic President Barack Obama as he visited Jersey Shore to see the devastation.
In the Virginia governor's race, Mr McAuliffe eked out a smaller-than-expected, 48% to 45.5% win against socially conservative Republican Ken Cuccinelli.
""Over the next four years most Democrats and Republicans want to make Virginia a model of pragmatic leadership,"" said Mr McAuliffe, a Democrat taking charge in a state with a Republican-led legislature. ""This is only possible if Virginia is the model for bipartisan co-operation.""
During the campaign, Mr McAuliffe had emphasised his opponent's tea party support. The hardline wing of the Republican party was widely blamed for last month's government shutdown, which temporarily laid off many of the federal workers who populate Virginia's suburbs.
Mr Cuccinelli, the state's outgoing attorney general, had stressed his Democratic rival's championing of the Obama healthcare law, whose troubled rollout has been a White House public relations disaster.
A Libertarian candidate who won nearly 7% of Virginia's vote may have cost the Republican the race, say analysts. Mr Cuccinelli was also vastly outspent by his Democratic opponent.
Mr McAuliffe is a veteran Democratic party fundraiser who was chairman of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.
Profile: Bill de Blasio
His capture of the governor's mansion in a crucial presidential swing-voting state could help plot a road map to victory for her should she run again for the White House, say analysts.
Meanwhile, Mr de Blasio will succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to become the first Democratic mayor of America's largest city since 1993.
He secured a whopping 73% of the vote, compared with 24% for his Republican rival, Joe Lhota.
In his victory speech, Mr de Blasio said the result showed that America's largest city had chosen ""a progressive path"", and he promised to make fighting income inequality his top priority.

""We're extremely pleased with our results,"" said Disney boss Robert Iger.
Disney's business ranges widely, including movie studios such as Marvel and Pixar, theme parks, merchandise - even a cruise line.
Its television networks, which include ABC, Disney and the sports-focused ESPN, are the biggest earners, together accounting for more than 40% of the firm's total revenue in the last financial year.
However, ESPN has struggled with millions of subscriber losses and advertising declines in recent years, as live sports services have begun to feel the pressure from online television and viewer demands for cheaper cable packages.
This spring, ESPN laid off more than 100 people, including writers and on-air personalities.
Mr Iger said the company is confident of the demand for ESPN and pleased with the traction it is gaining on platforms such as television streaming service Hulu.
Revenue in the media unit increased 3% year-on year.
Mr Iger said the firm is focused on its mobile audience, aiming for an increasingly customised experience that allows fans to focus on news about their favourite teams.
The company plans to sell ESPN-branded streaming directly to viewers by the end of the calendar year, and that kind of personalisation is also likely to be part of the package, he added.
""Consumers will be able to buy the sports they want, when they want,"" he said.
Mr Iger asked analysts for ""a little bit of credit"" for being candid with its thinking as it grapples with the changes.

"Amber Rudd argued revealing secret documents at the inquest in Surrey would damage public interest.
The inquest will have to decide whether Alexander Perepilichnyy died of natural causes or was unlawfully killed.
He collapsed outside his Weybridge home in 2012. Traces of a chemical linked to plant poison were found in his stomach.
Claims have been made at pre-inquest hearings that he could have been deliberately killed for helping to uncover a major fraud.
The claims have come from financial firms Hermitage Capital Management and Legal & General.
Mr Justice Cranston said: ""According to information provided by Mr Perepilichnyy to Swiss prosecutors before his death, Hermitage was used by senior Russian officials to perpetrate a multi-million dollar tax fraud against the Russian Treasury and Hermitage.
""Legal and General's interest is that it issued a substantial life insurance policy to Mr Perepilichnyy shortly before his death.
""Both Hermitage and Legal and General have suggested that Mr Perepilichnyy might have been murdered, possibly by agents of the Russian State.""
Surrey coroner Richard Travers had asked the home secretary and the foreign secretary to produce relevant material, but some of it was sensitive and Mr Travers did not have security clearance to view it, the High Court heard.
""Consequently, he decided that he was not in a position to decide the Secretary of State's application that it not be publicly disclosed and ordered the Secretary of State to make an application for public interest immunity (PII) to the High Court,"" the judge said.
He said he had ""no hesitation"" in finding the balance came down in favour of non-disclosure and ruled the Home Secretary was entitled to a PII certificate.
There were no cogent reasons for rejecting her view ""that there would be real and significant damage to national security from disclosure"", he added.
The ruling means the public, Mr Perepilichnyy's family, and family lawyers without clearance will be denied access to the documents.
The judge also said Mr Travers's position was ""untenable"" because he did not have the necessary clearance and a replacement would have to be found.

"""We're not going to default, they'll have to invent a new term to define what's happening,"" said President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner last week, deep in denial, as the deadline loomed for the country to meet its obligation to the so-called ""vulture funds"".
Thanks to a US court decision, Argentina is required to pay $1.3bn (£766m) to investors who bought its bonds at a big discount after its economic meltdown and previous default in 2001-02.
It failed to do so by 30 June and a 30-day grace period has now expired.
But the government resisted that course of action, because it feared that it could lead to the unravelling of other debt deals that it struck with most of its creditors.
As a result, a second default has now occurred, and the outcome could be painful for an economy that is already in recession.
Last time around, Argentina was left unable to repay or service more than $100bn of debt. The resulting default meant that it has not been able to borrow further money on the international markets since then.
Two successive restructuring deals, in 2005 and 2010, covered the overwhelming majority of bondholders, who agreed to accept about one-third of what they were originally owed.
However, hedge funds NML and Aurelius Capital Management snapped up a large chunk of the remaining distressed debt at low prices and are now pressing to be paid the full face value of their holding.
Their case against the Argentine government has been trundling through the US judicial system for some time. But Buenos Aires didn't expect the crunch to come so soon.
President Fernandez's government fully expected the dispute to go all the way to the US Supreme Court, which would have bought the country more time.
But in June, the Supreme Court declined to hear Argentina's appeal against the decision of a lower court that made it liable for the money.
Under that court's ruling, Argentina cannot use the US financial system to keep paying the restructured bondholders unless it also pays the ""vulture funds"".
And there are other hold-outs from the previous restructuring deals who could now follow the hedge funds' example and press for the full face value of their bonds.
From Argentina's point of view, there is a legal obstacle to its acceptance of the hedge funds' terms: a clause in the deals with the restructured bondholders, known as Rufo (rights on future offers).
This clause, which expires at the end of the year, states that Buenos Aires cannot favour the hold-outs over those who accepted the restructuring deals.
Given the choice, Argentina would have liked to spin out the negotiations with the ""vulture funds"" until 2015, when the clause will no longer apply.
But the US courts refused to comply, seeing the restriction as one of Argentina's own making that could be circumnavigated if the government wanted to.
And after all, why should the Argentine government put itself out? As Capital Economics emerging markets economist David Rees points out, the default will have a ""negligible"" direct impact on it.
""The authorities are already locked out of international markets and will remain so,"" he says.
""But default is likely to have negative consequences for the wider economy in two ways,"" he adds.
""First, it is likely to cause interest rates on corporate debt to increase, which may deter investment and hamper activity in the private sector.
""Second, default may spur some capital outflows, exacerbating a shortage of hard currency and putting renewed pressure on foreign exchange reserves and the peso.""
That hard currency shortage is reaching a critical point. The amount of foreign exchange held by the central bank fell by 30% last year and is now less than $30bn (£18bn) - the lowest level since 2006.
As well as allowing Argentina to service its debts, that money is also needed to finance imports. Capital outflows would also do further harm to an economy that is expected to contract by 1% this year.
Undeterred by all this, President Fernandez is ploughing on in her usual combative style, while seeking help from other quarters.
Earlier this month, she wangled an invitation to the Brics summit in the Brazilian city of Fortaleza as a special guest, alongside the leaders of member countries Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa.
While there, she obtained support from the group in her battle against the ""vulture funds"".
She also came away with assurances that the organisation's new Development Bank could well offer her an economic lifeline.
But Argentina's woes are testing her leadership style to the limit, while economic and political analysts are already hoping that the end of her mandate in October 2015 will usher in an era of renewal after the next presidential election.","Right from the start, the Argentine government's attitude to its debt dispute with US hedge funds made it all but inevitable that the country would fail to reach a compromise."

Single-player gamers did particularly well in computer tests to do with maths and problem solving.
The researchers think this could be because they're more familiar with computer games, so they're more at ease with tests on computers.

"German Justice Minister Heiko Maas said the measures would ensure German law was applied online.

They would assess complaints using the benchmark of German law ""and no longer just the terms of use of each network"", he said.

""And we agree that as a rule this should be possible within 24 hours.""
Germany's official welcome for hundreds of thousands of refugees - mainly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan - has triggered a backlash from nationalists, including neo-Nazis.

Facebook has said it relies on its users to report offensive comments that incite hatred.","Facebook, Google and Twitter have agreed a deal with Germany under which they will remove hate speech posted on their websites within 24 hours."

"Matt Smith nodded QPR in front before their former winger Junior Hoilett equalised by blocking goalkeeper Alex Smithies' clearance.
Sol Bamba's header gave Cardiff the lead, fuelling a fiery atmosphere at Cardiff City Stadium.
The hosts had chances to score a third but held out comfortably for a fifth win from five league games.
Their victory, coupled with Ipswich's defeat at home to Fulham, means the Bluebirds are now three points clear at the Championship's summit.
There was an expectant crowd at Cardiff City Stadium, but the sense of optimism stemming from the hosts' perfect start to the season was punctured by Smith's opener, as he nodded in from close range after Cardiff goalkeeper Neil Etheridge failed to clear Luke Freeman's cross.
Etheridge will have been disappointed with his hesitant effort, though it paled into insignificance compared to his opposite number Smithies' blunder.
Under pressure from a poor back-pass by his captain Nedum Onuoha, the QPR goalkeeper's clearance ricocheted off Hoilett and straight into the net.
Those two goals were typical of a compelling encounter played at breakneck speed, as entertaining because of its errors and robust challenges as it was because of its goals and chances at both ends.
It was fitting too that this battle should include a headed goal from a corner for Bamba, whose aerial duels with his adversary Smith were so brutal that they could have registered on the Richter scale.
Cardiff maintained the frenetic tempo in the second half and, buoyed by a vociferous home crowd, they twice went close to a third goal as Hoilett had one effort disallowed for a push before Nathaniel Mendez-Laing struck the crossbar.
Kenneth Zohore was then denied by a brilliant close-range save from Smithies as Cardiff continued to press but, with QPR offering little in attack, it was an ultimately simple fifth consecutive league win for Neil Warnock's in-form side.
Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock told BBC Radio Wales:
""Obviously I'm pleased. We made hard work of it at times but I was delighted with the way we played.
""We showed a lot of character, played some good stuff on the front foot, created some good chances. I thought [QPR goalkeeper Alex] Smithies was brilliant.
""It's a happy place and I'm really glad we've got two weeks off now [for the international break] without a press conference.""
Queens Park Rangers manager Ian Holloway said:
""We were doing fine when we got in front, we looked pretty comfortable and then it changed when we conceded the first goal, the manner of it, the timing of it. We could have dealt with it better.
""Unfortunately they forced us into a mistake and it knocked the stuffing out of us, got the crowd up. They then go and score from a set-play.
""On the balance of play, that's as good a Cardiff team as I've ever seen. It's going for them at the minute - they're making it go for them. They looked a real solid unit.
""The Bluebirds will be buzzing tonight but we weren't that far off them.""

"Dr Hawley Harvey Crippen was executed in November 1910 after poisoning his wife and hiding her dismembered remains under the cellar floor.
He was caught as he tried to escape to Canada with his mistress, Ethel Le Neve, who was disguised as a boy.
The letters, written while he was in prison and sold in Wiltshire, would remain in the UK, auctioneers said.
Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described the atmosphere in the saleroom as ""frantic"" with bidders calling in from Australia and the United States.
He said the letters provided a ""fascinating insight"" into Dr Crippen's mind during the last few days of his life.
One of his final letters, written to Lady Henry Somerset on 26 October 1910 - less than a month before he was executed - details his relationship with his mistress and his view that ""all yet may come right"".
Crippen was hanged at Pentonville prison, in London, on 23 November 1910, after an appeal against his sentence failed.
He became the first criminal to be captured with the aid of wireless communication, after the captain of the ship he was escaping on to Canada, the SS Montrose, became suspicious.
The ship's captain sent a telegraph message informing the owners he believed Crippen was on board.
The infamous killer's letters, which are being sold by a private collector, had been expected to make between £3,000 and £5,000 in the sale at Henry Aldridge and Son auctioneers.","Letters written by one of the 20th Century's most notorious murderers have been sold for £11,000 at auction."
"The Crown Prosecution Service said 1,892 cases were dropped at court due to the ""significant ill-health, elderliness or youth"" of a defendant.
Another 439 cases were abandoned before the suspect was charged.
The CPS said the number of cases dropped for these reasons accounted for 0.3% of all prosecutions in 2014.
Such prosecutions dropped at court were 1,714 in 2013 and 1,402 in 2012. Those dropped before charge were 354 in 2013 and 128 in 2012.
Between January and March this year, 516 were dropped at court and 132 before charge.
The charity Victim Support said it was important that the decision not to prosecute was explained to victims.
Chief executive Mark Castle said: ""Victims often fear that they will not be believed, so it can be many years before they come forward.
""It is critical that victims have the reasons behind a decision not to prosecute properly explained to them so that they understand that it does not mean they have not been believed.""
The figures - released after a Freedom of Information Act request by the Press Association - did not specify the nature of the suspected offence.
The CPS said the decision to prosecute was made if there was both sufficient evidence and it was in the public interest.
A spokeswoman said: ""The Code for Crown Prosecutors recognises that the more serious the offence, the more likely it is that a prosecution is required, and the age or ill-health of a defendant will be taken into account when deciding whether to prosecute.""
In the case of former Labour MP Lord Janner, who has dementia, the CPS decided not to pursue historical child sex abuse claims against him.
The decision was overturned following a review, and a fitness to plead hearing is due to take place on 7 December. Lord Janner denies the allegations.","More than 2,000 suspected criminals avoided prosecution in England and Wales last year because of their ill-health or age, figures have shown."

"Surveillance camera footage showed people walking past the girl as she lay bleeding and unconscious.
It sparked a wave of condemnation and soul-searching on China's social networking sites.
Doctors had earlier said Wang Yue, who had been in a coma since the incident on 13 October, was unlikely to survive.
Anger and debate over toddler
Police have detained the drivers of both vehicles involved in the incident, which happened in the city of Foshan in southern Guangdong Province.
Wang Yue was knocked down by a van while wandering through a market, where her parents run a shop. The driver sped off without checking on the girl's condition.
Over the following minutes, 18 people walked past the bleeding toddler, and another van ran over her legs, but no-one stopped to help.
The distressing footage was shown on television.
A rubbish collector who finally moved the toddler to the side of the street was hailed as a national hero, but the incident led many online commentators to question the state of Chinese morality.
By Martin PatienceBBC News, Foshan
Other than the two chalk circles marked ""1"" and ""2"" on the road, there was little to suggest anything out of the ordinary.
The hardware stores selling irons, light fittings and taps were all open. Shopkeepers sat around chatting to each other.
But what happened on a covered street of this huge wholesale market last week shocked China.
A shopkeeper close to where the incident took place said she had been sickened when she saw the footage.
""Every time I watch it, my heart breaks,"" said Hu Haiou. ""I catch the news every night to see if she'll survive. The people who walked by were shameful.""
Another shopkeeper, Chen Guilin, said it had been raining hard the night of the incident.
""The raindrops sounded like drumbeats on the roof,"" she said, ""We had no idea what happened outside.""
Passers-by were 'shameful'
A spokesman for the hospital told the AFP news agency that Wang Yue had died of ""systemic organ failure"", adding that no expense had been spared to try to save the girl, whose parents are migrant workers.
There have been millions of internet comments about how to encourage good Samaritans - and many more expressing outrage that so many people refused to help.
Her death was one of the most remarked on topics on China's Weibo  - a micro-blogging site similar to Twitter - on Friday as people expressed sorrow and anger over the incident.
""Farewell to little Wang Yue. There are no cars in heaven,"" wrote one micro-blogger.
Guangdong province is debating the introduction of a law to force people to help others in obvious distress.
Initial online polls, though, suggest most people are against it.

Organisations in Guangdong are also looking at other ways to encourage people to act with compassion when faced with an emergency.
The provincial government's political and legal affairs committee is using its micro-blog site to gather opinions about how to ""guide brave acts for just causes"" and promote ""socialist morals"".
Several commentators have linked the failure of the passers-by to help with high-profile cases in which residents who stopped to assist people in distress were later held responsible for their plight.","A two-year-old girl in southern China, who was run over by two vans and ignored by 18 passers-by, has died, hospital officials say."
"Silvanos Mudzova, a member of the pressure group Tajamuka, said he had been abducted from his home in Harare on Tuesday night by unknown men.
He told the BBC he had been blindfolded and tortured with sharp objects.
He was also electrocuted on several parts of his body, including his genitals, Mr Mudzova said.
He said his captors had been armed.
The activist said his attackers had interrogated him, wanting to know who was funding his Tajamuka pressure group and why they were campaigning against President Mugabe's government.
The spokesman for the group was also arrested but granted bail on Wednesday.
Despite the latest government ban on protests in the capital, Harare, a massive demonstration has been planned for Saturday, according to Mr Mudzova.
Zimbabwe has seen a wave of protests recently over the declining economy.
Earlier this month, President Mugabe criticised judges who gave permission for anti-government protests which later turned violent.
He said the judges had shown a reckless disregard for peace and warned they should take care when making decisions.
The opposition has accused Mr Mugabe of trying to intimidate the judiciary.

"The project to find influential games that deserved to be in the Hall of Fame was begun in February by The Strong - a US museum of play.
Tetris, Super Mario Bros, Pac-Man, and World of Warcraft were also chosen to feature in an exhibit of iconic games.
Angry Birds and Minecraft were nominated but did not make the final list.
The museum invited people to nominate games played on PCs, consoles, hand-held gadgets, phones or in arcades.
The winners span three decades of gaming from Pong, first released in 1972, to World of Warcraft which debuted in late 2004.
Pong was chosen because it launched the entire games industry, said the museum in a statement, revealing the six entrants in its Hall of Fame. It acknowledged that it was not the first electronic game but was the first to get ""wide-scale public attention"".
Other games were chosen for becoming cultural icons (Tetris), making games a mass-market phenomenon (Pac-Man) and changing the way games were made (Doom).
World of Warcraft was chosen, said the museum, because of its longevity and the way it has brought millions of players together into one game world.
The winners were whittled down from a long list of 15 that was picked by an internal panel of academics, journalists and game experts recruited by The Strong. Their decisions were based on a game's longevity, influence, geographical reach and iconic status.
The museum now plans to feature the winning games, the other nominees and many others in a permanent exhibition.
The other nine nominees included Legend of Zelda, Space Invaders, the Oregon Trail and Pokemon. Nominees for the 2016 inductees to the hall of fame are now being accepted.
Based in Rochester, New York, The Strong was founded in 1968 by Margaret Woodbury Strong a collector of toys, dolls and other play paraphernalia.",Pong and Doom have been inducted into the first Video Game Hall of Fame.
"World number three McIlroy has missed the cut at his home event for the last three years and has recorded just two top-10 finishes in nine attempts.
""My performances haven't been what I'd want but it's a tournament I would love to win one day,"" said the 27-year-old.
""I feel like my game is in good enough shape to do that.""
The Northern Irishman, who is tournament host for the second year, recorded his best result in 2008, when he finished seventh in his first full year as a professional.
That came two years after he watched the final day of the 2006 Ryder Cup on the course as a 17-year-old spectator.
But, despite being frustrated at failing to turn good performances into a victory so far in 2016, McIlroy thinks he can contend for the title.
""The Irish Open always was, but even more so now, one of the most important weeks of the year for me,"" said the four-time major winner.

""I'm coming off a couple of decent weeks in the States where I felt I played better than the results suggested, and the K Club is a course I feel I can do well on.
""It would be huge [to win]. Anyone that plays professional golf, they dream of winning their home open. You don't get many opportunities so it would be very special. It's one tournament that is missing from my CV.""
Asked if he could pinpoint why he had not performed well in Ireland, McIlroy said: ""No, not really. Maybe the pressure of playing at home - we don't play at home often - and maybe trying too hard or putting too much pressure on myself.
""There were obviously reasons I wanted to get involved in this tournament. I wanted to contribute something, where coming to the Irish Open was becoming more of a burden instead of something I relished and enjoyed.
""Being able to get involved and not just play for myself, but play for and help other people, I enjoy that part of it.
""I want to help out. I want to make this one of the best tournaments in the world and we've made a few good strides towards doing that.""
McIlroy believes he learnt a lot from acting as tournament host last year, when he slumped to an opening round of 80 and missed the cut at Royal County Down, but was on hand to present the trophy to eventual champion Soren Kjeldsen.
""There were times where I spread myself too thin last year with a lot of commitments and we've tried to scale that back this year,"" he added.",Rory McIlroy is confident he can improve on his poor record in the Irish Open when he competes at this week's event at the K Club in County Kildare.
"The Austrian first became a shareholder in Williams in 2009 but has been slowly reducing his links since the start of his involvement with Mercedes in 2013.
Wolff's shares, a little under 5%, have been bought by US businessman Brad Hollinger, whose stake rises to 15%.
Healthcare entrepreneur Hollinger first bought into the team in 2014 but has no formal management role at this stage.
However, he said that he would be ""happy to participate in any way they see fit"".
And Williams chief executive officer Mike O'Driscoll said the team ""would be delighted if he could make a greater contribution to our business in the future"".
Wolff, who agreed with Mercedes when he became its F1 boss that he would work towards ending his involvement with Williams, said: ""I am surprised how emotional I am about this day, to be cutting my final business ties to [team founder] Sir Frank Williams and to the team at Williams.
""Having entered the team from a pure investment perspective, I soon found myself in a much more active role, helping to restructure this great independent F1 team.
""I am proud to have joined the sport with a team of true passionate racers, where we had to make spot-on decisions for the future of the business and its employees; I learned some lessons the hard way, but they were all valuable for understanding the industry.""
Sir Frank Williams remains the majority shareholder in his team with 52% of the stock; his co-founder Sir Patrick Head holds about 9%, with just under 21% listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and 4% held by an employee trust.
Wolff added: ""I look back with pride on the first ever IPO (initial public offering) of an F1 team in Frankfurt, and can see the next generation of the Williams family leading the team into a bright future.""
Sir Frank Williams said: ""Given his role at Mercedes-Benz, a full divestment in Toto's shareholding became inevitable and we thank him for this judiciousness in only selling to a suitable buyer when the time was right.
""In Brad Hollinger, Toto has sold his full shareholding to a highly successful businessman with an immense passion for Formula 1 and our team - he is a great asset.""",Mercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff has sold off his remaining shareholding in the Williams team.
"The level of compensation is set at €100,000 per person per account across the European Union.
Since 2010, that has meant a limit of £85,000 in the UK.
But that amount is recalculated every five years.
Due to a weak euro in the summer of 2015, the new level has been set at £75,000 from Jan 1 2016.
The limit offers compensation to anyone who has money in a UK authorised bank, building society, credit union or friendly society that goes bust.
On the assumption that the insolvency stopped you getting your money out in the normal manner, you would be invited to apply to the FSCS for compensation.
Any savings institutions should be formally authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority to hold your money. If it is not, it is operating fraudulently.
The plan now is that most savers will receive their compensation within seven days, and the remainder of them within 20 days.
As before, holders of joint accounts are both eligible for compensation in their own right. So, a payment of up to £170,000 (£150,000 from Jan 2016) may be made in relation to a joint account.
Your debt to the bank will still exist and you will still have to repay it - the loan will not evaporate just because your lender has gone bust.
Any money owed to you by the bank, e.g. in a savings account, will be paid in its totality - up to the new limit.
Previously it would have been offset by any sum you owed to the savings institution.
Firstly, there is only one chunk of compensation per saver, per authorised institution.
So if you have two or more accounts with one bank your compensation limit will not be greater than for someone with just one account.
This is a more complicated issue, though, if you have money in two or more banks with different names.
If they are all part of a wider banking group, or one of its divisions, which has just one overall PRA authorisation, then you will still be eligible for only one chunk of compensation.
If, however, the banks holding your money have separate authorisations, despite being part of a larger group, then you will still be able to claim compensation per bank, regardless of the fact that they may all be owned by one giant institution.
You can check whether an institution is authorised at a group level or as a separate entity by checking the authorised firms register on the PRA's website.
This specifies the biggest authorised deposit takers and the different names and bank brands that they cover.
For example, if you have £85,000 saved with Barclays and £85,000 with HSBC Bank, all of this would be protected.
However, if you have money in accounts with two different brands within the same authorised institution, then only £85,000 is covered.
An example would be having two accounts, one with Barclays and one with Standard Life Bank, as Standard Life Bank has been part of Barclays since the start of 2010 and is covered by Barclays' authorisation.
On the other hand, Lloyds and Bank of Scotland have separate authorisations, despite both being part of the wider Lloyds Banking Group.
The FSCS deposit protection scheme covers small businesses. To qualify they have to meet at least two of the following conditions. They must:
Larger businesses are excluded from the scheme, except in relation to claims made under a compulsory insurance policy.
This might be where a company makes a claim but the insurer fails to pay out, or if premiums have been handed over but not in fact used to buy a valid policy.","Bank and building society accounts in the UK come with a guarantee: if the institution holding your money goes bust, you will be compensated."

"The prisoner swap came after secret talks between the US government and the Taliban, brokered by Qatar.
Bergdahl was serving with an Alaska-based infantry regiment in Paktika province near the Pakistani border and went missing on 30 June 2009, five months after being deployed to Afghanistan.
The circumstances of his capture remain murky, with speculation he may have walked away from his base out of disillusionment with the US campaign.  In March 2015, he was charged with desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy.
The US believes he was across the frontier in Pakistan for most of his captivity, reportedly held by the Haqqani network, which operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and is allied to the Afghan Taliban.
Profile: Sgt Bowe Bergdahl
The circumstances of Sgt Bergdahl's capture in 2009 remain unclear, although a Pentagon investigation a year later concluded he left his post in Paktika Province without authorisation, according to a Pentagon official speaking to Associated Press news agency.
Several commentators and soldiers have branded him a deserter and called for him to be punished.
The New York Times said on his disappearance in 2009 had noted he had left military areas before, during a training programme in California and an Afghan outpost, but returned each time.
US officials told the newspaper the report did not conclude whether Sgt Bergdahl had intended to permanently desert the military.
The US military's top-ranking officer, Gen Martin Dempsey, has that the Army would not ignore misconduct but that the 28-year-old was innocent until proven guilty. ""When he is able to provide the facts, we'll learn what happened.""
The defence department opened up an investigation into his disappearance and capture, appointing a two-star general with combat experience in Afghanistan to lead the inquiry.
Taliban officials say the 28-year-old was handed over near Khost, close to the the Afghan-Pakistan border, on the evening of 31 May. A several-dozen strong US special forces team flew in by helicopter and briefly met some 18 Taliban on the ground.
The exchange, captured on video, shows Sgt Bergdahl sitting in a pick-up truck before being walked to the helicopter.
Once the helicopter was in the air, Bergdahl wrote the letters ""SF?"" on a paper plate - an abbreviation for special forces - and reportedly broke down when the men responded: ""Yes, we've been looking for you for a long time.""
Taliban release video of handover
Sgt Bergdahl was the only US soldier being held by the enemy in the Afghan conflict, and Washington had long been seeking his release, spurred on by the ""Standing with Bowe"" campaign led by his parents in Hailey, Idaho.
Negotiations for the US-Taliban prisoner swap began three years ago with US and Taliban officials meeting face-to-face in Qatar.
But the talks did not move forward because the US were pushing for a wider peace process, while the Taliban wanted to limit the talks to a prisoner swap, Taliban sources told the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul.
Direct negotiations broke down a year ago when the Afghan government opposed the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar, although secret talks continued, mediated by Qatar.
The issue was given more impetus as plans solidified to pull nearly all American forces out of Afghanistan by the end of 2016. US sources say the breakthrough came when hardline Taliban leaders dropped their opposition to a swap.
On Thursday, Mr Obama said Sgt Bergdahl's health was deteriorating and officials were ""deeply concerned about it"".
But the prisoner swap was apparently sped up after US officials determined the Taliban would likely kill Sgt Bergdahl if any word of the deal was leaked, according to congressional and White House sources who spoke to the Associated Press.
Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel told the BBC's Katty Kay he and other military chiefs based their decision ""on the information that we had, that his life, his health, were in peril"".
His father Robert Bergdahl said Bowe was struggling to speak English after his long captivity. In an emotional White House lawn press conference with Barack Obama shortly after the release, Robert Bergdahl delivered his son a message in Pashto, the language of his captors.
After immediate medical attention at a military hospital in Germany,  Sgt Bergdahl was flown to San Antonio, Texas, to continue treatment.
On Friday, Army officials said he was in a ""stable condition"".
He ""looked good"", was in uniform, and saluted, Maj Gen Joseph DiSalvo said.
""He appeared just like any sergeant would when they see a two-star general - a little bit nervous,"" Gen DiSalvo said. ""But he looked good, saluted, and had good deportment.""
Can you lose your language?
The exchanged prisoners are Mohammad Fazl, Khirullah Khairkhwa, Abdul Haq Wasiq, Mullah Norullah Noori and Mohammad Nabi Omari.
They are thought to be the most senior Afghans still held at Guantanamo, having been captured during America's military campaign in 2001.
Fazl served as the Taliban's deputy defence minister and is accused of possible war crimes, including the murder of thousands of Shia Muslims.
Khairkhwa served as interior minister and governor of Herat, Afghanistan's third largest city. He is alleged to have had direct links to Osama bin Laden.
US President Barack Obama says Qatar has given assurances ""that it will put in place measures to protect our national security"".
Under the deal, the five freed Taliban detainees will be banned from leaving Qatar for at least a year, meaning they cannot return to Afghanistan until after a majority of US forces have left.
The Associated Press' Kathy Gannon, who was shot in Afghanistan while covering the recent elections, says the five men are important but not likely to change the balance of the war - and having been away from Afghanistan for more than a decade, they would not find Taliban foot soldiers very loyal.
Some argue there is US precedent for this type of transfer, with Ronald Reagan's administration in 1985-86 reportedly winning the freedom of US hostages in Beirut in exchange for arms destined for Iran.
But Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called it a fundamental shift in policy that would act as an incentive for further abductions of US personnel.
Some US lawmakers have complained the swap breaches a law that Congress should be given 30 days' notification before Guantanamo Bay detainees are released. The White House says it took the chance to free Sgt Bergdahl in ""unique and exigent circumstances"".
Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, normally a White House ally, was enraged that the president had not notified her or the intelligence committee she leads, of the pending swap, although a White House official did call her on Monday to apologise for the delay.
The US has a long-standing policy not to negotiate with those it deems terrorists and the prisoner swap has drawn criticism - especially from conservatives.
Republican Senator John McCain told the BBC the swaps ""threatened"" US security, as the detainees released were too dangerous to be walking free, and would put other US military lives at risk. Other lawmakers have called for a inquiry into the administration and military's decision making process.
But Mr Obama is publically unapologetic for the swap.
""We saw an opportunity and we seized it,"" he said, adding ""as commander-in-chief I am responsible for those kids"".
No Obama apology for Bergdahl deal
Correspondents say it is unclear what impact the release will have on a wider peace process.
The Afghan High Peace Council want talks with the Taliban to happen inside Afghanistan, and does not want to involve the Americans.
Bowe Bergdahl returned to the US on 13 June 2014, arriving at a medical centre in Texas where he finished the last phase of his reintegration process.
In his hometown of Hailey, Idaho, a rally scheduled months ahead was quickly turned into a homecoming event that was cancelled.
City officials cited safety concerns, because of a large increase in the number of expected attendees, and local officials have received messages blasting the town for honouring Sgt Bergdahl's return.
Sgt Bergdahl returned to active duty in July, working at a desk job at Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston.
In March 2015, he was charged with desertion with intent to shirk important or hazardous duty and misbehaviour before the enemy by endangering the safety of a command unit or place.
A preliminary hearing will be heard in front of a judge at Fort Sam Houston. A date has not been set for that hearing.
He faces up to five years in prison on the desertion charge and life in prison on the misbehaviour charge.

"Rayo Vallecano accepted a £2m bid for the 26-year-old and the Premier League club will seal a third summer signing, subject to international clearance.
Michu has passed a medical and agreed personal terms to become new Swansea boss Michael Laudrup's third signing.
Laudrup said: ""We're talking about a player who scored 16 goals in a small team in the Spanish league.""
Michu said: ""I really wanted to come to Swansea because of the coach, the style of play and the Premier League. I had other offers.
""I've always followed the Premier League from Spain and I watched a lot of Swansea games last season. They played good football and I liked their style.""
He will join fellow new signings defender Chico Flores and midfielder Jonathan de Guzman on Swansea's three-match pre-season tour to the United States on Sunday following Saturday's friendly at Welsh Premier Port Talbot Town.
Unlike De Guzman and Flores, Michu has not previously worked with Laudrup but he said: ""I also know how Michael Laudrup's teams play, so I'm looking forward to being part of that.
""The coach was fundamental to me joining Swansea. I remember watching him as a player - he was a machine.""
The former Celta Vigo playmaker scored 15 goals in 37 games in his only season for Vallecano in La Liga last term.
Vallecano's La Liga rivals Sevilla were also believed to be interested in signing Michu while he had also been linked with Swansea's Premier League rivals Manchester United, Fulham, Stoke City, Liverpool, Southampton, Wigan and West Bromwich Albion.
Michu, an attacking midfielder, is seen as an ideal replacement for Gylfi Sigurdsson who, after an impressive loan spell at the Liberty Stadium last season, has joined Tottenham Hotspur from Hoffenheim.
""I am happy that the player wanted to come here because I was here,"" said Laudrup. ""I have never worked with him and I haven't paid him!
""He has had a press conference in Madrid to say goodbye to Rayo Vallecano and he should join us for the tour to the USA.""",Swansea City have completed the deal to sign Michu as the Spanish midfielder has agreed a three-year contract.

"He founded advertising agency Video International or Vi - still one of Russia's biggest - and  went on to became head of the state news agency RIA Novosti.
In 1996, he devised the advertising campaign that helped then President Boris Yeltsin win re-election.
The US authorities are investigating his death aged 57. Coroners say he died as a result of blunt force trauma to the head.
His son - Anton Lessine - has made a name for himself as a Hollywood film producer.
Mikhail Lesin, once regarded as a free media pioneer, became one of the first in Russia to advocate tightening state control of the internet - a policy the Kremlin appears to have pursued with greater vigour in recent years.
As minister for communications and media (1999-2004), he oversaw the hostile takeover of NTV by state-controlled Gazprom-Media in 2000. It happened a month after Vladimir Putin was sworn in as president.
At the time NTV, Russia's third national TV station, was critical of Kremlin policy, including the war in Chechnya. In the takeover, businessman Vladimir Gusinsky lost control of NTV and other major media assets and was imprisoned.
In 2004, the European Court of Human Rights accepted Mr Gusinsky's argument that the state had forced him to sell his media business in return for fraud charges against him being dropped. It ordered the Russian state to pay him â‚¬88,000 (Â£69,000, $97,700).
Lesin was also responsible for the closure of channels TV-6 and TVS and instrumental in setting up international broadcaster RT (Russia Today) in 2005, the Kremlin's TV mouthpiece abroad.
His role in bringing media outlets into the Kremlin orbit earned him the nickname The Bulldozer.
In November 2009, Lesin was sacked from his post of presidential media adviser, apparently over a conflict of interests.
He became head of Gazprom-Media in 2013, overseeing NTV when it broadcast a number of documentary films targeting the opposition.
He resigned in late 2014, citing family reasons, but respected Russian newspaper RBK reported that he had fallen out with a Gazprom-Media shareholder and close Putin associate, Yuri Kovalchuk.
In 2014, the US Department of Justice and the FBI launched an investigation into Lesin's property in the US, amid suspicions of corruption and money laundering.
In a 2014 letter to US Attorney General Eric Holder, US Senator Roger Wicker raised concerns about the California property Lesin had bought since moving his family to the US.
""He acquired multiple residences at a cost of over $28 million,"" he wrote. ""That a Russian public servant could have amassed the considerable funds required to acquire and maintain these assets... raises serious questions.""
He also pointed to an apparent financial link between Lesin and Mr Kovalchuk, who is under EU-US sanctions, as is Mr Kovalchuk's Bank Rossiya.","Mikhail Lesin, the Russian media figure found dead in a Washington hotel room in November, made his name in PR and advertising in the 1990s."
"Captain Doug Beattie was awarded the Military Cross for bravery.
This was while serving with the Royal Irish Regiment (RIR) in Afghanistan.
He said the government was failing to implement the Military Covenant, a promise to look after members of the armed forces and their families.
Speaking in a BBC NI Spotlight programme to be broadcast on Tuesday night, he said military veterans in Northern Ireland do not receive the same kind of priority treatment as those in other parts of the UK.
""I have missed the birth of children, I have missed the death of family members, all for the service of my country, and now I feel completely let down,"" he said.
""It's simple, we want equality, we want parity. If I'm willing to sacrifice my life for my country in exactly the same way as somebody from England, Scotland and Wales, then I want recognition for that.""
The Covenant was enshrined in law in 2011 and states that the nation has a ""moral obligation"" to members of the army, navy and airforce and their families.
It pledges support for military veterans and their families, and says those with serious physical and mental injuries should be given special consideration in some cases.
In England and the rest of Great Britain, that means veterans are entitled to some form of priority medical treatment. But that does not happen in Northern Ireland.
The number of veterans in Northern Ireland is huge.
The Ministry of Defence (MoD) claims there could be up to 120,000, including more than 60,000 who served with the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) and home service battalions of the RIR.
Critics, and even the MoD, agree that the greatest shortfall in treatment in Northern Ireland is for those suffering from post traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD.
One of those suffering from PTSD is Nikki Cunningham, a 27-year-old former army medic who completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan before being medically discharged last year.
She has told Spotlight she is angry at the way she was treated, and remains haunted by her experiences in Afghanistan.
""It never leaves you,"" she said. ""The smell of burnt flesh never leaves your senses, it's always there.
""You go to sleep, close your eyes, the images are there, you wake up, they are there. The slightest little noise triggers the thought, an image, an incident, and you're back to where you were, back on tour.
""The army broke me, and I haven't really found that I've had the sufficient help that I needed.""
Robert McCartney is a former member of the RIR who served in the Falklands and Kenya as well as Northern Ireland.
He was diagnosed with PTSD shortly after leaving the army and now runs a charity called Beyond the Battlefield, based in Newtownards, County Down.
It helps veterans who need medical treatment and provides assistance with a range of other issues.
""I actually believe that the paramilitaries and the prisoners groups and everyone else who was part of this conflict in Northern Ireland are being treated better by their people than soldiers are being treated by the MoD and the government, and that's disgusting,"" he said.
The Ministry of Defence rejects those claims.
It insists veterans in Northern Ireland are able to access the aftercare service they need, and the Military Covenant is being implemented there.

"Chuck Erickson has been shooting deer for forty years. ""The kids start hunting round here about the age of eight - supervised by an adult of course,"" he tells me.
Chuck uses his late father's old hunting rifle. Chuck is 56; the gun is older than he is.
He's killed dozens of deer with it over the decades, and the heads of the finest antlered bucks are displayed on the walls of his farmhouse. ""We used to hunt for meat,"" he says, ""but now we're mostly trophy hunters."" He thinks around 30% of the population in this part of the state get out into the woods to hunt deer at this time of year.
This is Donald Trump country now - blue collar, plain-speaking, patriotic.
It is a short drive from Chuck's farm to the former steel city of Johnstown.
As you pass through its outskirts you see streets of boarded up houses. The city centre is scarred by the derelict buildings of a once great industry. This is steel and coal territory. But those industries were swept away in the age of global markets and open borders.
Donald Trump promised to reverse that dereliction and bring industry back to America.
""We have the best steel-making coal and there's none getting out of the ground,"" Chuck told me. ""That process to make steel can come back to our shores and that would be tremendous for everybody.
""I think he [Donald Trump] can probably bring that back in the first hundred days of his administration.""
He believes that the Trump victory is the start of the re-industrialisation of the United States.
Mr Trump's promise to build barriers to reverse this long industrial decline is a retreat to economic nationalism, to protectionism. It turns the page on a forty-year western economic orthodoxy - the liberal market consensus of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.
And Donald Trump's victory finds its British echo in the vote, in June, to leave the European Union.
In the old industrial heartlands of England and Wales, traditional Labour voters defied their party's advice and voted decisively for the Leave side.
The economic revolution that both the US and the UK went through in the 1980s did make both countries richer, in the sense that aggregate wealth grew.
It wasn't supposed to matter that that new wealth would be unevenly shared, that inequality would also grow, because wealth at the top would trickle down; a rising economic tide would lift all boats.
But not all boats were lifted.
There is an irony in this: that the two countries which pursued the deregulating, globalising, free-market reform agenda most vigorously are now the first two countries to have rebelled against open borders.
Ferdinand Mount was a senior adviser to Margaret Thatcher in the early part of her premiership. He ran the Number 10 Policy Unit at the time of the 1983 general election - the second of the three that she won.
""It was a transatlantic borrowing really,"" he told me. ""It was Ronald Reagan who believed that a rising tide would lift all boats. That was, I think, over-optimistic. Overall it was a success, but it failed to create fresh jobs in Wisconsin and Ohio and Michigan, just as it failed to create fresh jobs in, say, Ayrshire and the areas where heavy industry declined.""
In both countries 2016 has plunged the left into a huge crisis.
The US Democrats were once absolutely aligned with the interests of blue collar America.
In the mid-20th Century, Franklin Roosevelt hugely expanded the role and power of the federal government, the state in American society, to pursue greater social equality, welfare, health care, job creation, the rebuilding of America's shattered industry.
How did the Democrats become so detached from their working class base that it took a billionaire property developer to articulate the frustrations of so many who have seen their incomes stagnate or decline over decades?
In the UK, Labour must face the same question.
For in both countries, the mainstream left accepted the post-Thatcher, post-Reagan economic consensus. They came to see the politics of class grievance as a vote loser. They distanced themselves from the 'cloth cap' image in the drive to embrace a more modern, more progressive politics.
In Scotland, once an impregnable fortress in which Labour won every election for fifty years, the party was all but wiped out in last year's UK election; it retained only one MP of the 56 Scotland sends to Westminster.
In the devolved Scottish parliament, Labour is now the third largest party, behind the governing Scottish National Party and the Conservatives.
In England, UKIP activists believe that they are now the authentic voice of working class experience; that June's referendum result is a sign that Labour's traditional support in the old industrial heartlands is now so soft that it is ready to switch sides, just as it did in Scotland.
In Barnsley, in South Yorkshire, I meet Gavin Fenton and Anthea Brownrigg.
For much of their lives, both had voted Labour. Not any more.
""The lack of jobs and lack of opportunities for our young'uns is horrendous,"" says Gavin. ""And with the mass migration under the Labour party under [Tony] Blair in particular, all the wages were compressed. So the poor in this town were getting poorer. So to be let down by the party that I loved as a boy is unforgiveable.""
""I think immigration is a big problem as well,"" adds Anthea. ""I think it's just a case of UKIP fills in the gap where Labour once was for the working class.""
In Europe, anti-establishment parties of both left and right have been emboldened by Britain's decision to leave the European Union.
Half a dozen EU countries have general elections in 2017. Those contests will be dominated by the question of Europe itself.
In his last visit to Europe before he leaves office, President Obama called on Germany's Angela Merkel.
For 70 years we have thought of leadership of the Western world as being English-speaking, rooted - as it is - in the transatlantic partnership forged during World War Two.
But in 2016 leadership of that old pre-Brexit, pre-Trump conception of what the liberal democratic west should be, has moved to Berlin.
""The Germans are neurotic about leadership in the world,"" says the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Anne Applebaum.
""They're neurotic about leadership even in Europe. They don't even like to think of themselves as having a foreign policy at all. So no, I don't think they're ready for this moment. But things are beginning to change in Germany with many people now thinking - 'Well, if we don't do it, no-one will.'""
Germany is still profoundly shaped by its history.
The modern Bundesrepublik has built a firewall between itself and previous Germanys. Integrating itself into Europe has been the country's way of normalising itself.
It has been a long, patient process of Europeanising the nation. Germany is now in a period of settled peace with all nine of the neighbours with whom it shares a border.
That has never happened before and was unimaginable even 30 years ago.
Being wedded to the EU has been Germany's act of contrition and of redemption. It has always meant far more to most Germans than mere trade and prosperity.
The international concert pianist Saleem Ashkar is a Palestinian who has settled in Berlin. He speaks warmly and with respect about his adopted country.
""Germany is traumatised by its past,"" he says. ""And it has used that trauma for the good. This is a very thoughtful, very careful country, a country that is very awakened and very careful about the danger of sleepwalking"".
So 2016 presents Germany with a new challenge and a new responsibility: how to lead in Europe without appearing to dominate in Europe.
For the idea of German domination still rouses too many ghosts - not least for the Germans themselves.
2016 has changed the shape of the post-Cold War order of things - economically, politically, geo-strategically.

"Of the 245 families interviewed, 76% said that their child's illness had had a major impact on finances with two in three parents experiencing a loss of earnings.
The survey was carried out by children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent.
It wants the government to ensure families get more financial support.
For their report, entitled Counting the Costs of Cancer, the charity also sought the views of 90 young people with cancer through an online survey, focus groups and telephone interviews.
Parents and young people told the charity that they spent on average £367 and £277 respectively on cancer-related expenses every month, and with treatment lasting up to three years, the bills soon mounted up.
This added up to a spending of £4,400 for parents and £3,325 for young people each year, the report said.
These costs included travel and car parking to get to hospitals and treatment centres, additional clothing for the child as a result of weight loss, food to supplement that available in hospital, and other costs such as telephone calls and accommodation.
The report found that of those parents who acquired debt, 41% borrowed £1,000 or more and 27% borrowed more than £2,000.
Six per cent of parents surveyed said they had turned to high interest, short-term loans to cope with the additional costs.
Ross was 11 months old when he was diagnosed with Bilateral Wilms Tumour, a cancer of the kidney.
His mum, Eileen, and dad, Shaun, both gave up work to look after him and their daughter, who was three.
""We took out a loan for £20,000 to make sure we could cover the extra costs of his care,"" says Eileen.
""I stayed with Ross in Yorkhill Hospital for five months. I had to buy food there and buy clothes for him. Meanwhile, Shaun was doing 70-mile round trips to visit us.
""It was a very tough time. We are still paying off the loan and will be until Ross starts secondary school.""
They got no financial help for the first three months, before receiving the Disability Living Allowance and some small grants from charities.
Ross is eight years old now. He only has half a kidney and may need a transplant when he is older.
Both Eileen and Shaun are back at work but both have changed jobs to suit their circumstances.
""The five months after his diagnosis were very hard. The government should be doing more to help.""
Family finances were also put under pressure by time needed to care for the child with cancer, with three in five respondents saying they had to reduce the number of hours they worked.
Some parents were forced to give up work completely to care for their child.
CLIC Sargent said it was concerned that government reforms would restrict families' options to financial support through the benefits system.
Lorraine Clifton, chief executive of CLIC Sargent said the cost of caring for children with cancer was often unexpected.
""Everyone is suffering in this economic climate but parents of children with cancer are amongst the hardest hit. The extra costs can be significant. It's shocking to hear that some families felt driven to debt in order to get through financially.
""We're dependent on the generous support of the public and other donors to fund our vital work to support young cancer patients, but the money we raise can only be part of the solution.
""We want to work with the government and other organisations to find better ways of ensuring young people and children with cancer, and their families, have the financial support they need.""
The report also found a significant impact on the lives of young people who had cancer.
Five in six surveyed said that their quality of life had been affected and two in three young people felt they were less able to study well.
A spokesman from the Department for Work and Pensions said that people with terminal cancer are fast-tracked.
""In these cases we pay the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance immediately and unconditionally regardless of daily care needs.

"Peter Metcalf was involved in defending the force against unlawful arrest claims after the 1984 Orgreave clash.
He also played a key role in reviewing statements after Hillsborough.
Deputy Chief Constable Peter Hayes and Assistant Chief Constable Walter Jackson are connected to both cases.
The officers, who were involved in a review of the evidence after Orgreave and have links to Hillsborough, have both denied any wrongdoing.
Mr Metcalf did not wish to comment on Orgreave when approached by the BBC.
About 10,000 strikers and 5,000 police officers clashed at Orgreave coking plant in June 1984.
Mr Hayes ordered a review of the way evidence had been gathered about Orgreave and was later involved in co-ordinating the force's evidence after the disaster at the Sheffield stadium.
Mr Jackson was given the job of reviewing the Orgreave evidence and was at Hillsborough to watch the FA Cup semi-final after signing off the policing plan.
The parallels between Hillsborough and Orgreave have been drawn before. Now evidence is starting to emerge showing the actual links, the names of people involved in the aftermath of both.
There have been claims the way South Yorkshire Police conducted themselves after 'The Battle of Orgreave' fed into their response to the Hillsborough disaster.
There have been growing calls for some form of investigation to fully understand what happened during the miners' strike and how that may have shown a culture within the South Yorkshire force that endured long after.
But it should also be remembered these are very different incidents. Nobody died at Orgreave. Although miners were put on trial, the cases collapsed so there was no miscarriage of justice. That said, the miners have always carried a sense of injustice about what happened. Their calls for an inquiry now have the backing of some of the Hillsborough families. It's up to the home secretary to decide what happens next.
Mr Metcalf wrote a note saying he had been told some of the police statements did not match the video evidence at Orgreave.
His note also records Mr Metcalfe as saying that he had been told that senior officers were reluctant to provide anything that might undermine the case.
Last year, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it had identified possible cases of attempting to pervert the course of justice in relation to Orgreave.
However, the police watchdog decided an investigation was not in the public interest.
Former miners' union president Arthur Scargill has called for an inquiry into the Battle of Orgreave disorder.
More than 120 officers and pickets were injured and 93 people were arrested following clashes at the coking plant.
Campaigners have called on Dave Jones, the interim chief constable of South Yorkshire Police, to open up the force's archives on Orgreave.
The Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign said it wanted Mr Jones to intervene in its legal bid to push Home Secretary Theresa May to hold a public inquiry.
Mr Jones said he would ""welcome an appropriate independent assessment of Orgreave"".
""The Hillsborough inquests have brought into sharp focus the need to understand and confront the past and give people the opportunity to explore the circumstances of such significant events,"" he said.
In the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster, police accounts of what happened were amended, in some cases to remove criticism of senior officers.
In contrast to their professional training, police officers at Hillsborough were told not to record the day's events in their pocket books but to set down their ""recollections"". In an ""unprecedented process of review and alteration"", they were then edited by the force's lawyers before submission to the official inquiry.",Senior officers and a solicitor who were involved in the South Yorkshire Police response to Hillsborough and the so-called Battle of Orgreave can be named for the first time.

Families work with police, the health service, voluntary sector and council to avoid violence at home.

""They feel shame and stigma attached to being a victim of domestic abuse, while also fearing the consequences for their child if reported,"" she said.
The programme seeks to stop children moving from one abusive relationship to another, using a ""whole-family approach"" unique to Doncaster to build families' self-esteem and resilience, Ms Henry-Leach said.
Many teenagers on the programme have lived with domestic violence between parents so the project attempts to ""de-normalise"" abuse and help them move on to healthier relationships.

The actress won Academy Awards for her roles in Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine in 2014 and in 2005 for The Aviator.
She will be awarded the honour at the London Film Festival's annual awards ceremony on 17 October.
The BFI described Blanchett as ""a fearless and subtle actress"".
""She has the rare gift of seeming utterly to inhabit the characters she plays and has an amazing ability to convey complex layers of emotion to stunning effect,"" it added.
Blanchett shot to global fame playing Queen Elizabeth I in 1998 film Elizabeth, followed by roles in The Talented Mr Ripley, The Lord of the Rings trilogy and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.
The actress has two films receiving their UK premiere at the London Film Festival - Carol and Truth.
Truth, which also stars Robert Redford and Mad Men's Elisabeth Moss, tells the true story of CBS journalist and 60 Minutes producer Mary Mapes, who risked her career to find the ""truth"" and expose a story on the then US President George W Bush.
It will be screened as the Fellowship special presentation film.
Set in 1950s Manhattan, Carol sees Blanchett play a woman trapped in a loveless marriage who falls for a younger woman, played by Rooney Mara.
Previous recipients of the Fellowship include Tim Burton, Helena Bonham Carter, Ralph Fiennes and Stephen Frears.
Al Pacino and Mel Brooks have also been awarded the honour in the past year.
Suffragette, starring Meryl Streep and Carey Mulligan, will open the London Film Festival on 7 October, while Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs biopic will bring it to a close on 18 October.",Oscar-winning actress Cate Blachett is to receive the BFI Fellowship for her contribution to film.
"The team has made the most precise map of the ""oldest light"" in the cosmos.
Earlier observations of this radiation had suggested the first generation of stars were bursting into life by about 420 million years after the Big Bang.
Planck's data indicates this great ignition was well established by some 560 million years after it all began.
""This difference of 140 million years might not seem that significant in the context of the 13.8-billion-year history of the cosmos, but proportionately it's actually a very big change in our understanding of how certain key events progressed at the earliest epochs,"" said Prof George Efstathiou, one of the leaders of the Planck Science Collaboration.
The assessment is based on studies of the ""afterglow"" of the Big Bang, the ancient light called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which still washes over the Earth today.
The European Space Agency's (Esa) Planck satellite mapped this ""fossil"" between 2009 and 2013.
It contains a wealth of information about early conditions in the Universe, and can even be used to work out its age, shape and do an inventory of its contents.
Scientists can also probe it for very subtle ""distortions"" that tell them about any interactions the CMB has had on its way to us.
One of these would have been imprinted when the infant cosmos underwent a major environmental change known as re-ionisation.
It is when the cooling neutral hydrogen gas that dominated the Universe in the aftermath of the Big Bang was then re-energised by the ignition of the first stars.
These hot giants would have burnt brilliant but brief lives, producing the very first heavy elements. But they would also have ""fried"" the neutral gas around them - ripping electrons off the hydrogen protons.
And it is the passage of the CMB through this maze of electrons and protons that would have resulted in it picking up a subtle polarisation.
The Planck team has now analysed this polarisation in fine detail and determined it to have been generated at 560 million years after the Big Bang.
The American satellite WMAP, which operated in the 2000s, made the previous best estimate for the peak of re-ionisation at 420 million years.
The problem with that number was that it sat at odds with Hubble Space Telescope observations of the early Universe.
Hubble could not find stars and galaxies in sufficient numbers to deliver the scale of environmental change at the time when WMAP suggested it was occurring.
Planck's new timing ""effectively solves the conflict,"" commented Prof Richard McMahon from Cambridge University, UK.
""We had two groups of astronomers who were basically working on different sides of the problem. The Planck people came at it from the Big Bang side, while those of us who work on galaxies came at it from the 'now side'.
""It's like a bridge being built over a river. The two sides do now join where previously we had a gap,"" he told BBC News.
That gap had prompted scientists to invoke complicated scenarios to initiate re-ionisation, including the possibility that there might have been an even earlier population of giant stars or energetic black holes. Such solutions are no longer needed.
No-one knows the exact timing of the very first individual stars. All Planck does is tell us when large numbers of these stars had gathered into galaxies of sufficient strength to alter the cosmic environment.
By definition, this puts the ignition of the ""founding stars"" well before 560 million years after the Big Bang.  Quite how far back in time, though, is uncertain. Perhaps, it was as early as 200 million years.  It will be the job of the next generation of observatories like Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, to try to find the answer.
The new Planck result is contained in a raft of new papers just posted on the Esa website.
These papers accompany the latest data release from the satellite that can now be used by the wider scientific community, not just collaboration members.
Two years ago, the data dump largely concerned interpretations of the CMB based on its temperature profile. It is the CMB's polarisation features that take centre-stage this time.
It was hoped that Planck might find direct evidence in the CMB's polarisation for inflation - the super-rapid expansion of space thought to have occurred just fractions of a second after the Big Bang. This has not been possible. But all the Planck data - temperature and polarisation information - is consistent with that theory, and the precision measurements mean new, tighter constraints have been put on the likely scale of the inflation signal, which other experiments continue to chase.
What is clear from the Planck investigation is that the simplest models for how the super-rapid expansion might have worked are probably no longer tenable, suggesting some exotic physics will eventually be needed to explain it.
""We're now being pushed into a parameter space we didn't expect to be in,"" said collaboration scientist Dr Andrew Jaffe from Imperial College, UK. ""That's OK. We like interesting physics; that's why we're physicists, so there's no problem with that. It's just we had this naïve expectation that the simplest answer would be right, and sometimes it just isn't.""

"The 41-year-old replaces former Scotland team-mate Graham Alexander, who was dismissed on 30 September.
Pressley was sacked by Coventry City in February after almost two years in charge, following a seven-game winless run that left them in the relegation zone.
He recently rejected the chance to talk to Scottish side Dundee United about their vacant managerial position.
Pressley has been working as a coaching for the Scottish Football Association and had just agreed to look after the Scotland Under-17 team on a one-off basis for a three-match round of qualifiers.
In a recent interview with BBC Radio Scotland, after being linked to the role at Dundee United, Pressley said: ""I have built up a very good reputation in England and I have a burning desire to manage at the elite level.
""That's not an arrogance. That's a belief. In order to do that, I think you have to manage in a country like England.""
The former Hearts and Rangers centre-back started his coaching career at Falkirk in 2010, leaving the Bairns three years later to take charge of Coventry.
He kept the Sky Blues in League One in his first full season in charge despite serious financial difficulties which resulted in the club being docked 10 points for going into administration.
He was fired the following year with Coventry 21st in the table, in a season when they were beaten at home in the first round of the FA Cup by non-league Worcester City.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood have confirmed that assistant manager Chris Lucketti will remain in his role, while Pressley's former Coventry assistant Neil MacFarlane has joined the coaching staff.",League One side Fleetwood Town have appointed Steven Pressley as manager.
"You are less likely, perhaps, to think of Bach, Haydn, Chopin and Rachmaninov.
But for one native Easter Islander, these long-dead European composers are a daily inspiration.
Mahani Teave started playing classical music as a young girl growing up on the South Pacific island, one of the most isolated places on earth.
But within a year her piano teacher had left. The only piano on the island fell into disrepair and Teave's career looked to be heading the same way.
But her mother had other plans. She moved the entire family more than  3,700km (2,300 miles) to the Chilean mainland so her daughter could continue to play.
Teave completed university and went on to study music in the United States and Germany, where she is now based. Aged 29, she is regarded as one of the region's finest pianists.
Teave describes her childhood as idyllic.
""I was in complete contact with nature, swimming in the ocean, climbing trees, running freely. I wish everyone could enjoy that kind of childhood.""
But on an island with a population of fewer than 5,000 people, it was culturally limited.
""There was really no chance to develop,"" she recalls. ""When the piano teacher arrived, her idea was to retire, but then this child turns up and says to her, 'I want to learn piano, please teach me!' So that's how I started. I'd go and practise with her for hours every day.
""When the teacher left, my mum said it was just too cruel, to allow children to dream but then not be able to fulfil them. That's when we moved to mainland Chile.""
Teave says she used to find it difficult to reconcile her Polynesian roots with her love of European classical music.
""They were two completely different worlds,"" she says. ""But the more I travelled I came to realise that we're all one people, with the same feelings and the same problems. And it's the same with music. It's about different ways of expressing the same feelings.""
Two decades after she first sat down at a piano, Teave is trying to ensure that the next generation of Easter Island children have things easier than she did.
She has started a music school on the island and has persuaded people to donate instruments. Piano classes started in April and violin classes in June.
""The idea is to add cello, guitar and ukulele lessons,"" she says. ""One very generous gentleman has kindly offered to donate a grand piano.""
The school has teachers but their salaries are only guaranteed until later in the year.  Teave is trying to ensure funding does not dry up.
""It's been shown that youth orchestras have a real impact on society. If you're in an orchestra you learn to respect the conductor, to listen to your fellow musicians, to work together. And those are important values.
""The alcoholism rate on Easter Island is really high, and one wonders why. I think it's because of the amount of talent and energy that ends up wasted and going nowhere.""
Teave is currently playing a series of concerts in cities up and down Chile. Her repertoire includes works by Chopin, Beethoven, Liszt, Debussy and Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor, which has a special place in her heart.
""It was the first piano concerto I ever heard, and I really loved it, and still do,"" she says. ""I always wanted to play it, so when I got the chance here I was really happy.""
From Chile she will return to Europe before embarking on a tour of Asia later this year.
Then, in December, she will head back to Easter Island, a five-hour flight from the Chilean mainland, for a concert with her aspiring pupils at the new school.
Teave says the islanders are innately talented musicians but all too often lack the resources they need to nurture that talent. Even when they have instruments, they usually have to teach themselves how to play them. Pianos, cellos and double basses are a novelty.
""Music is a really big part of the culture on the island,"" she says. ""If there's a guitar or a ukulele in the house, you can guarantee that everyone in the family, even the five-year-old kid, can play it.""",Think of the remote Chilean outpost of Easter Island and you are likely to think of the giant stone statues that are dotted around the island and whose origins are shrouded in mystery.

Southend remain one spot and one point outside the play-off places after sixth-placed Millwall overcame Northampton, while defeat leaves Chesterfield nine points from safety with thee games remaining.
Anthony Wordsworth and Cox breached the static Spireites defence in the second half to kill the contest, while Marc-Antoine Fortune made it four with his first touch after coming off the bench.
Just before the break Dion Donohue was dismissed for a foul on Jason Demetriou to add to Chesterfield's woes.
Cox was the man that earned and scored Southend's 15th-minute penalty. On the ball, he stood firm as goalkeeper Thorsten Stuckmann scampered towards him and when contact was made the referee had an easy decision to make and the spot-kick was duly converted.
Poor defending contributed to United's three second-half goals, Wordsworth converting a Demetriou cross while Cox took advantage of some solid Will Atkinson work before Fortune slipped through a shell-shocked defence to complete the scoring.

"The visitors led 14-6 at half-time after two tries from Thomas Waldrom wiped out Gopperth's two kicks.
Wasps' Charles Piutau and Chiefs prop Harry Williams traded tries and Gareth Steenson kicked Exeter 24-11 ahead.
Frank Halai gave Wasps hope, but Exeter looked set to hang on until Gopperth converted Piutau's last-second try.
Wasps, who won the Heineken Cup in 2004 and 2007, will play Saracens in the last four at Reading's Madejski Stadium on 23 April after the English champions fought back from a half-time deficit to beat Northampton 29-20 in the second semi-final on Saturday night.
Match-winner Gopperth was mobbed by his team-mates as the ball sailed over the posts from the right touchline, sparking wild celebrations among the Wasps fans at the Ricoh Arena.
Exeter players slumped to the turf in disappointment as the Premiership club, only promoted to the English top flight six years ago, missed out on their first European semi-final.
The Chiefs had defended admirably throughout the quarter-final, particularly in the opening half hour when they limited their dominant hosts to just two Gopperth penalties.
And tries from Waldrom and Williams, plus the reliable boot of Steenson, left a quietened home crowd fearing the worst.
But Exeter's efforts finally told as Wasps produced a memorable fightback in the final 15 minutes.
With Exeter threatening, the home side played out from behind their posts as Elliot Daly and Christian Wade turned last-ditch defending into an attack full of sharp running and trickery, Halai eventually finishing off a few phases later and Gopperth converting for 24-18.
Wasps relentlessly pounded the tiring away defence in search of a dramatic finale - and it finally arrived.
The game had ticked past 80 minutes when Piutau raced on to a flat pass to dart through the Exeter line, and Gopperth applied the coup de grace.
Gopperth, 32, told BBC Radio 5 live sports extra: ""As a goalkicker they are the moments you practice night and day.
""I had to treat it as my first kick of the match. I was relaxed and as soon as it hit the foot I've never celebrated so much. As soon as I struck it, I knew it was good.
""The win was a great team effort from that position and we showed a lot of character. I was happy to finish it off for the boys.""

If she gets through, she'll spend the next 10 years training for the project.
The mission aims to send teams of four to the red planet every two years from 2025, until 40 people are living there.
The Dutch project is privately funded and needs to raise around Â£4bn to send up the first group. So far it's raised around Â£500,000 (so it's 1/8000th of the way there).

"The Department for Transport predicted a ""decline in network performance"" once one in four cars become driverless.
However, should driverless vehicles make up between 50% and 75% of cars, DfT researchers say they will reduce congestion.
The average time spent delayed on city roads at rush hour will fall by 12.4% when 25% of vehicles are driverless.
The DfT said early models of the vehicles acted more cautiously and the result could be a ""potential decrease in effective capacity"" on motorways and A roads.
But as more people adopted the technology and it became common place on the country's road network, the study found that congestion could be cut by 40%.
Steve Gooding, director of motoring research charity the RAC Foundation, said: ""There's a prize to be had in terms of swifter, safer journeys, but the transition to that world will be challenging.
""There are around 32 million conventional cars on the UK's roads - as driverless cars come in, traffic flow could initially get worse rather than better, potentially for many years.
""Much will depend on how an autonomous car's parameters are set and just how defensively these vehicles will be programmed to drive.""
The study used software to map out the effects of the cars on the road network.
The DfT said the report was the first step into more trials and researching, ensuring driverless cares are ""safe and beneficial for all"".
Transport minister John Hayes said: ""This exciting and extensive study shows that driverless cars could vastly improve the flow of traffic in our towns and cities, offering huge benefits to motorists including reduced delays and more reliable journey times.""
Ministers are also planning to extend existing insurance cover to driverless vehicles, covering individuals when they are driving and when they have handed over control to the computer.
In the event of a crash caused by the technology, a government consultation document suggests the driver and anyone else affected should be able to claim from the insurer and, in turn, the insurer would be able to claim compensation from the manufacturer.
In the document, the government adds it will incorporate the insurance proposals for automated vehicles forward into the Modern Transport Bill, which is expected to be debated by MPs later this year.","Driverless cars could initially lead to longer delays on the UK's major roads, according to a government report."

They added 96 for the third wicket at Chester-le-Street after Alastair Cook (15) fell five short of reaching 10,000 Test runs and under-pressure Nick Compton (9) continued his poor run.
Hales, seeking his first Test hundred, was caught at slip, while Root spooned to cover as Sri Lanka fought back.
But Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali added 70 to give England the upper hand.
Bairstow was caught behind for 48 to give the excellent Nuwan Pradeep his third wicket, but Moeen remains unbeaten on 28.
The hosts won the first Test at Headingley by an innings and 88 runs.
Despite some superb catching from Sri Lanka on a cold day, England will be confident of amassing the sort of first-innings total that will put pressure on the tourists' inexperienced batting line-up.
Hales made 86 at Headingley and picked up where he left off with another sizeable contribution at the top of the order.
After a circumspect start, he accelerated after lunch in partnership with Root, scoring heavily down the ground on the off side.
He looked poised to become the first Englishman to make an international century in all three forms of the game before he swung hard at the part-time left-arm spin of Milinda Siriwardana and was brilliantly caught at slip by Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews.
Nonetheless, Hales is beginning to look like he could be the reliable opening partner for Cook England have been looking for since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012.
For England's other top-order batsmen, it was a tale of familiar flaws as once again the team made a stuttering start to their innings after Cook won the toss.
The skipper was first to fall, in characteristic fashion, fiddling needlessly outside off stump and offering a sharp catch to Dimuth Karunaratne at second slip.
Compton failed to dispel the question marks over his place during another scratchy and underwhelming innings, grinding his way to nine off 34 balls before before top-edging to long leg.
Even Root could reproach himself for a poor shot, offering a simple catch to cover as he attempted to work a short ball from Pradeep to leg.
It was the seventh time in the past eight innings in which Root has passed 50 that he has failed to go on to three figures.
Although England ended the day narrowly on top, this was a fine performance in the field by Sri Lanka.
Their catching was magnificent - as well as Mathews and Karunaratne, Suranga Lakmal produced a brilliant tumbling effort at long leg to dismiss Compton and Lahiru Thirimanne flung himself to his right at cover to end James Vince's innings.
They also performed strongly with the ball, despite missing two of their best pacemen, Dushmantha Chameera and Dhammika Prasad, through injury.
Pradeep and Lakmal bowled a disciplined line and length, Siriwardana chipped in with two wickets, and they conceded only four extras in 90 overs.
England opener Alex Hales on BBC Test Match Special: ""I'm pleased with the form I'm in. When you get in you want to make a big score, but I'd have taken it at the start of the day.
""It's was my own fault - I probably try to hit it too hard. Mathews went a little deeper and took a brilliant catch.
""This is a better pitch to bat on than Headingley so I felt a little bit more fluent today. There's still things to work on and I feel like I'm improving every day.
""This has been a learning curve. I'm enjoying being as good as I can in all three formats.""
Sri Lanka all-rounder Milinda Siriwardana: ""It was a brilliant day for us. It's not easy to get wickets, so we're happy. We fielded really well. We took the half-chances.
""The conditions are better than the first game. It will turn and it's good for the batsmen.
""It was cold this morning. I had the hand-warmers in my pocket. It was the coldest I've played cricket in.""

"Ten incidents of possible police misconduct have been found by investigators looking into the killing of Jacqueline Oakes.
Marcus Musgrove was jailed in July 2014 for killing the 51-year-old.
A review was launched over her death, including contact she had with various agencies at the time.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it had issued notices to 26 serving West Midlands Police officers and seven police staff, advising them they are subject to investigation.
Notices have also been sent to an officer who has retired and to one who now works at another force.
An IPCC spokesman said its initial assessment had identified ten potential misconduct issues relating to incidents between April 2013 and January 2014.
""Our independent investigation is looking at whether the police officers and staff involved resourced, recorded and risk assessed the incidents in line with force domestic abuse policy,"" the spokesman said.
A domestic homicide review is also being carried out by Birmingham Community Safety Partnership.
Ms Oakes was discovered in a bedroom at Century Tower, Dollery Drive in Edgbaston, in January 2014.
The mother-of-four died from multiple blunt force injuries.
Musgrove, of Lichfield Road, Aston, aged 40 when sentenced, was told he would serve a minimum of 18 years.
At the time, West Midlands Police said he carried out the fatal attack after weeks of subjecting her to controlling and abusive behaviour.",Thirty-five members and former members of West Midlands Police are being investigated over events that led to a woman's murder in Birmingham.

"The Scottish Gamekeepers' Association said the latest employment figures showed the sector was outperforming other areas of the economy.
North Highland College in Thurso reported that every one of this year's Higher National Certificate students has secured a job on a sporting estate.
Country sports are thought to be worth Â£240m a year to the Scottish economy.
The gamekeeping and wildlife management course was designed to provide students with training in conservation as well as traditional gamekeeping skills, including snaring and the use of firearms.
North Highland College gamekeeping lecturer Richard MacNicol said: ""The modern gamekeeper has to have a rounded, balanced approach to land management.
""Our graduates are helping to support the rural economy and a diverse, well managed countryside.""
Borders College and Scotland's Rural University College in Fife also said the skills obtained by their students were proving valuable to landowners.
The Scottish Gamekeepers' Association has welcomed the news.
SGA chairman Alex Hogg said: ""This is a major success story and the three colleges deserve immense credit.
""We are creating youth jobs at a time when the economy is faltering and young people, especially in remote areas, have few other opportunities.""
There is real frustration amongst landowners and the gamekeepers they employ about the profession's image.
Political and media attention often focuses on cases of wildlife crime, most notably the illegal persecution of birds of prey.
Gamekeepers believe they do not get the credit they deserve for the stewardship of our countryside, while landowners argue the economic benefit of country sports is often overlooked.
They are hoping the new generation of gamekeepers being trained by Scotland's colleges will help change that.
Angus McNicol, of Cawdor Estates near Nairn, told BBC Scotland: ""It's a highly-trained profession these days. It's very different to how things were in the past.""",Colleges across Scotland are reporting strong demand from sporting estates for newly-trained gamekeepers.

"United are expected to release an official statement in the coming days.
Giggs, 42, had a year remaining on his contract as assistant manager but new boss Jose Mourinho intends to fill that role with long-time friend Rui Faria.
Unable to reach agreement over another role at the Premier League club, Giggs, who made a record 963 appearances for the club, has decided to move on.
Cardiff-born Giggs has passed all his coaching badges and has never made any secret of his desire to move into management.
Linked with Swansea last season, he felt he was ready to manage United, having served his apprenticeship under David Moyes and then Louis van Gaal.
But he was known to be less than impressed with how Van Gaal's exit was handled by United, when news of the Dutchman's sacking emerged moments after the club's FA Cup final success.
Giggs was also disappointed to be overlooked in favour of former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss Mourinho, whose appointment was confirmed in May.
Giggs joined the United academy on his 14th birthday, turning professional aged 17 in November 1990 and making his first-team debut against Everton on 2 March, 1991.
He won a record 13 league titles, two European Cups, four FA Cups and four League Cups to become the most decorated British player of all time.
He became a player-coach following the arrival of Moyes as manager in 2013, taking control of the first team for the final four games of the season after the Scot's dismissal.
Giggs was then appointed as assistant-manager by Van Gaal in 2014.
In the 2013-14 season, he was made a player-coach by Moyes and retired as a player that summer, aged 40, before signing a three-year deal as Van Gaal's number two, with the pair leading United to their first FA Cup win in 12 years last season.
Giggs represented one of the final links to the Ferguson era - and given his service and achievements at United, the club risk a potential PR disaster in letting him leave.
The Welshman was largely responsible for promoting exciting 18-year-old England striker Marcus Rashford to the first team last season and is the embodiment of the United traditions of a commitment to youth and attacking football.
However, he was part of a static management team criticised by fans, pundits and former players for a dull style of play which ultimately cost Dutchman Van Gaal his job.
Led by executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, United are now a different club to the trophy-winning juggernaut of the Sir Alex Ferguson era.
With a revised transfer policy of world-class marquee signings and the abrupt termination of Moyes and Van Gaal's contracts, along with the appointment of Mourinho, winning has been prioritised ahead of longevity and long-term planning.
Despite one senior member of the club's hierarchy saying last year that Giggs ""triple-ticked"" many essential components needed for the manager's job, he remains unproven at the highest level.
Giggs has made no secret of wanting to manage United in the future and it was thought the club had a long-term plan with the same aim.
He is unlikely to be short of offers from chairmen ready to give the Welshman his first permanent managerial role, having passed all the relevant Uefa coaching qualifications and served his apprenticeship at one of the biggest clubs in the world.
Wales manager Chris Coleman has previously said Giggs could benefit from the ""spark"" of stepping out of his ""comfort zone"" at United, backing him to ""cut his teeth somewhere else and prove he has what it takes to go back there"".
Similarly, United goalkeeping great and former team-mate Peter Schmeichel said Giggs should ""learn the trade"" of management at another club.",Ryan Giggs has ended his 29-year stay at Manchester United by agreeing a settlement with the Old Trafford club.
"The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations have their spending level dictated by the Barnett formula.
Under it, extra funding or cuts for England has an affect on the other nations, dependent on their population size and the powers devolved to them.
Stormont's finance committee says parts of the formula could be more open.
That could include requiring the Treasury to publish data upon which Barnett-related decisions are based.
As an example, the committee pointed to the initial Treasury decision to classify infrastructure spending on the London Olympics as having UK-wide rather than England-only benefits.
That meant there were was no so-called consequential spending for the devolved governments.
The devolved nations did eventually get extra spending, but only about Â£30m rather than the Â£330m they thought they were due.
Some expert witnesses suggested that an independent body, such as the Office for Budget Responsibility, should be given an oversight role.
Prof Gerry Holtham, who produced a report on funding and financing in Wales, told the committee that Northern Ireland would benefit from the formula ""being put on a proper statutory basis with an element of independence from Treasury introduced"".
The committee also said that the executive should take ""pre-emptive measures"" for the event that the government decides to dispense with or alter the Barnett formula.
It said this could include piloting a new needs-based formula and developing a ""fully considered position"" on what arrangements will be in Northern Ireland's best interests.","The finance ministers of the devolved UK administrations should present joint proposals for improving the way they are funded, a Stormont committee says."

"Ms Dati gave a furious television interview denying any wrongdoing.
According to France's Le Point, the purchases included Hermes scarves.
The claims date to 2007-2010, during which time she was was justice minister under ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy.
Ms Dati, now an MEP for Mr Sarkozy's UMP party and mayor of Paris's 7th arrondissement, said it was normal practice to buy presents for foreign delegates.
A letter from the Cour des Comptes, which audits state accounts, lists €9,850 of unsuccessful claims - including hundreds of euros for pastries, as well as almost €1,500 on luxury gifts and more than €1,600 on clothes and accessories.
Another €180,000 spent on communications strategy was also rejected.
Ms Dati said the auditors had ruled against the justice ministry administration and not against her.
The auditors rejected the claims due to a lack of supporting documents and justification.
""The ministry of justice has never financed my personal costs or bought me any item of clothing,"" Ms Dati told AFP earlier this week.
""The state auditor has never accused me of anything, either personally or professionally.""
Speaking to the French TV channel iTele on Thursday, she attacked media coverage of the auditors' decision and said there was a political plot against her.
She said she had suffered racist attacks - being dismissed as an ""Arab"" - as well as sexism within her party, and that she had complained to Mr Sarkozy.
Ms Dati was the first Muslim woman to serve as a government minister in France. She has long complained of sexism and elitism in French politics.
She resigned as justice minister in 2009 amid criticism of her management style and gossip about her clothes and love life.
Correspondents say the UMP is keen to move on from a series of financial scandals, including an ongoing investigation into party funding, ahead of Mr Sarkozy's expected bid for the presidency in 2017.","France's former Justice Minister Rachida Dati has hit out at ""political plotters"" in her own UMP party after it emerged auditors had rejected expenses claims of nearly €190,000 (£137,000) for items including luxury clothing."
"Lauri Love, who has Asperger's syndrome, worries he will be sentenced to up to 99 years.
""If I went into a US prison, I don't think I'd leave again,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme.
A judge will announce next week whether Mr Love, from Stradishall, Suffolk, should be extradited.
Mr Love, who could face trials in three different US states, is accused of hacking into the FBI, the US central bank and the country's missile defence agency.
He said the US prison system was ""poor"" at handling people with psychological conditions, who faced widespread bullying.
""The way that mental health is dealt with in America is not in any way therapeutic,"" he said. ""I have Asperger's and I have depression, so suicide is a real risk.
""And if I get a 99-year sentence, it's an absurd length of time, meaning I would die in prison anyway.""
Mr Love calculates this could be the total combined sentence length if he is found guilty of hacking offences in each of New Jersey, Virginia and New York.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons says it works to provide education to staff and inmates on suicide prevention.
Mr Love told Victoria Derbyshire he could be ""bullied"" into accepting a plea bargain in the US - receiving a shorter sentence in return for admitting one or more of the alleged offences.
""The threat of what might happen to me is always in the background,"" he said. ""I've been scratching my face as a nervous reaction, which has exacerbated my eczema.""
Mr Love, 31, was first arrested at home in 2013 and had computer equipment seized by British police, who then released him on bail.
He was not charged in the UK, where the investigation into him was dropped.
In England and Wales, the maximum sentence for a computer crime such as those of which Mr Love is accused is two years and eight months.
His defence team argues that his depression and Asperger's syndrome - a form of autism - mean he should not be sent abroad, but US prosecutors say he is using his mental health issues as an excuse to escape justice.
""That's offensive to me, as someone who has had problems with mental health for all of my life,"" Mr Love said. ""I really feel for my parents, who have the worry and the stress of this. It's been very difficult for them.""
In 2012. the then Home Secretary, Theresa May,  blocked the extradition to the US of Gary McKinnon, a UK hacker with mental health issue, saying he was a suicide risk.
Since then, the law has changed, so judges rather than politicians decide on extraditions.
Mr Love's case is regarded as the first real test of the new law.
A judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court will announce her decision on whether to extradite Mr Love on 16 September.
Mr Love said he was ""guardedly optimistic"" he would be allowed to remain in the UK.
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.",A British man wanted in the US for allegedly hacking into government computers says he fears dying in jail if he is extradited.
"The party said 40,000 primary age children were taught in classes of 36 or more in England in 2016, blaming ""broken promises"" by the government.
But the Tories said Labour's attacks were ""a massive own goal"".
They said the Labour-led Welsh government had overseen increases in class sizes in Wales.
Mr Corbyn, who insisted on Thursday that he could defy the polls and ""change the direction"" of the election, has used Labour analysis of Department for Education figures to focus on education.
He said: ""The prime minister herself has said that super-sized classes are proof of a school system in a crisis.
""And that's what we've got on the Tories' watch.
""School leaders and teachers have said Tory cuts to school budgets will mean class sizes will be forced to grow even larger. We cannot risk our children's education in this way.""
In his speech, Mr Corbyn appeared to confuse some of the statistics released earlier by his party, inadvertently overstating the number of children in large classes.
He told supporters: ""500,000 children in England - half a million children - are now being taught in super-sized classes of over 36"".
The half a million figure is for class sizes of 31 - 34. A Labour spokesman said Mr Corbyn had mixed the figures up.
A Conservative spokeswoman dismissed Mr Corbyn's comments and pointed out that the number of infants in large classes had risen by 18% in three years in Wales.
""Of course we are not complacent about the situation in England,"" she added.
""There is more to do and that's why we are spending a record amount on schools - something we can afford to do because of our careful management of the nation's finances.""
Elsewhere on the campaign trail on Friday, Mr Farron will challenge Tory MPs who supported staying in the EU to oppose a so-called hard Brexit.
He will add: ""If these Tory MPs reject these principles and back a hard Brexit manifesto, then people will know that on the biggest issue of the day they went missing in action.""
Chalk and cheese. Black and white. Night and day. Yin and yang.
Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are not, repeat not, cut from the same cloth. Their fundamental beliefs differ enormously. Their solutions for society's problems are poles apart.
Politicians in opposing parties are sometimes friends across the boundaries. But it is hard, extremely hard, to imagine the Labour leader and the Tory leader ever quietly enjoying a pootle round the Berkshire countryside of a weekend, or a cappuccino in Islington in a quiet moment.
But right at the start of this election - whisper it - there is something significant they share.

The FBI worked with local police departments and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to help the teenage victims to find shelter and get medical attention.
The agencies want to ensure the teenagers do not return to prostitution.
""When kids are treated as a commodity in seedy hotels and on dark roadsides, we must rescue them from their nightmare and severely punish those responsible for that horror,"" FBI Director James Comey said in a statement.
The raids involved about 500 local police departments from across the country. A similar FBI-led campaign carried out last year uncovered about 160 teenagers working as prostitutes.","The FBI has broken up several sex trafficking rings across the US, uncovering more than 100 sexually exploited teenagers in a nationwide operation."
"The special, called The Return of Doctor Mysterio, will be shown on BBC One on Christmas Day.

"The drug Perjeta can reduce the need for mastectomies among breast cancer patients.
But the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) recommended it was not routinely used by the NHS amid concerns about long-term survival benefits.
Campaigners branded the move ""the ultimate postcode lottery"".
The drug, which is also known as pertuzumab, can treat an aggressive type of breast cancer known as HER2-positive.
Around 15% of people diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer have HER2-positive tumours.
Perjeta was approved for use in England and Wales in September 2015, where it is used to shrink and control tumours before surgery.
After announcing its decision, the SMC said it would meet the pharmaceutical company behind the drug, Roche, to discuss ""next steps"".
Nicolas White, of Breast Cancer Care, told BBC Radio Scotland that the drug could have benefited around 400 people in Scotland.
Speaking on the Good Morning Scotland programme, he said the regulator's decision was ""disappointing and confusing"".
""If you're diagnosed with this particular type of breast cancer and you live in Gretna, you wouldn't benefit from this treatment,"" he added.
""Yet only a few miles down the road in Carlisle, if you were given the same diagnosis, you would benefit from this treatment.
""It's the ultimate postcode lottery, really, a cross-border postcode lottery.""
It follows a similar controversial decision in September 2014, when the SMC decided not to approve Kadcyla, another breast cancer drug.
More than 3,400 women in England have used Perjeta and Kadclya via the Cancer Drugs Fund, according to Roche.
The drug company's general manager Richard Ewin said:  ""Today's decision is a devastating blow to women in Scotland with this very aggressive form of breast cancer.
""This means that these women will be denied this early-stage treatment which allows for reduction of large tumours to a size that is operable, potentially enabling breast conservation surgery instead of mastectomies.""
Perjeta was one of four drugs the SMC rejected for routine use on the NHS, although it did back a new treatment Jevtana - also known as cabazitaxel - for patients with advance prostate cancer.
SMC chairman Professor Jonathan Fox said he knew some decisions would be ""hard for patient groups and clinicians"".
""However, when we considered all the evidence in front of us, it was not strong enough for us to be able to accept these medicines for routine use,"" he added.
Jevtana was initially rejected by the SMC in 2011 and again earlier this year.
The move was welcomed by Prostate Cancer UK, which has campaigned to give men in Scotland access to the drug.
Heather Blake, the charity's director of support and influencing, said: ""Today's approval of cabazitaxel chemotherapy is welcome news, and represents an important milestone for men with prostate cancer in Scotland.
""This is the last in a string of drugs which we have had to fight to be made available throughout the UK to those who would benefit.
""It means men in Scotland will now be routinely offered the same suite of treatments as those in other parts of the UK, ending variation in access which has been an ongoing injustice for years.""",Breast cancer sufferers in Scotland have been denied routine access to a treatment which is available to patients south of the border.
"Stanley Rangers RLFC said Evan Hawksworth was injured during a game on Sunday against Batley Boys.
The club said: ""It is with the deepest regret that Stanley Rangers announce the tragic passing of their under-14s player Evan Hawksworth.

Under-14s team coach, Steve Abrahams, informed Evan's team-mates and described him as ""our great friend, team-mate and all-round good guy.""

"Mr Schleicher, who runs the tests, says the high results of deprived pupils in some Asian countries shows what poor pupils in the UK could achieve.
The most disadvantaged pupils in Shanghai match the maths test results of wealthy pupils in the UK.
Mr Schleicher says it ""debunks the myth that poverty is destiny"".
On Monday, Education Secretary Michael Gove said individual schools in England should take Pisa tests, so that they could compare themselves against international standards.
The latest Pisa - Programme for International Student Assessment - test results were published last year by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, ranking developed countries in terms of how well 15-year-olds performed in tests in reading, maths and science.
Source: OECD
This showed the UK as a middle-ranking country, with Asian school systems, such as in Singapore, South Korea and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China, as the highest performers.
But Mr Schleicher's latest analysis compares the performance of the most deprived 10% of pupils.
This reveals how the poorest in many countries overlap with the results of the wealthy in other countries.
The poorest 10% of pupils in Shanghai are as good as the most privileged 20% of teenagers taking the test in the UK and the United States.
In Europe, the Netherlands has the highest-performing pupils from the poorest families.
Poor pupils in the Netherlands are as good at maths as much better-off teenagers in France.
The poorest 10% of pupils in Hong Kong scored at a higher level than the wealthiest in Sweden and Norway.
The very lowest performers among this group were in the Slovak Republic.
Mr Schleicher says it shows how academic differences attributed to social background should not be unquestioningly tolerated.
""We tend to overestimate the impact of poverty,"" he says .
There was also a challenge to the idea that the UK has an unusually poor record on social mobility.
Dr John Jerrim at the Institute of Education published a study suggesting that in international terms the UK was mid-ranking in the link between family background and future employment opportunities - 17th out of 34 developed countries.
There was greater equity in Scandinavia and some European countries, including Germany and the Netherlands.
But Dr Jerrim said social mobility in the UK was not dissimilar to France, Spain and Italy - and the UK's record was better than some central and eastern European countries.
""Policymakers often state that the relationship between family background and labour market earnings is stronger in the UK than most other countries,"" he said.
""It is not true that we stand out compared to the rest of world. Policymakers should avoid making such exaggerated claims when discussing this politically sensitive issue.""","There is nothing inevitable about the weaker academic performance of poorer pupils, says an analysis of Pisa tests by the OECD's Andreas Schleicher."

"Mr Murphy, who was hit by eggs on Thursday, claimed the Yes Scotland campaign was organising ""mobs"" to intimidate him and undecided voters.
The campaign for independence condemned ""all forms"" of abusive behaviour.
Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond and Prime Minister David Cameron also spoke out against the egg attack.
Mr Murphy, the shadow international development secretary, has been on his 100 Towns in 100 Days tour, on behalf of the Better Together campaign to keep the Union.
After being egged while speaking in Kirkcaldy, Fife, the Scottish MP said he was suspending the tour for 72 hours to take police advice on the safety of continuing.
In the meantime, he also called on ""Yes"" campaigners to ""call off their attack mobs"".
Mr Murphy said his claims had been backed up by footage released by Better Together, which the campaign described as a compilation of several 100 Towns in 100 Days events, including dates in Ayr, Motherwell and Glasgow.
In the footage, the MP is seen being loudly jeered by members of the public, some of whom accuse him of being a ""traitor"", ""parasite"", ""terrorist"" and ""quisling"".
Mr Murphy told the BBC the first 70 dates of his tour had been ""good fun"" and ""passionate"", but recently had taken a ""sinister turn for the worse"".
""In the past 10 days or so, the Yes Scotland campaign has organised mobs to turn up at every meeting that I'm taking part in to try and silence undecided voters and to try and intimidate me,"" said the Scottish MP, who pointed to evidence on social media sites to support his claims.
""This isn't about people throwing eggs, this is about a mob mentality trying to silence a quiet patriotic majority.
""It won't work. It turns off undecided voters and it embarrasses the vast majority of good, decent 'Yes' campaigners.""
The egg incident was witnessed by Allan Crow, editor of the Fife Free Press newspaper, who tweeted that ""Yes"" supporters had chanted over Mr Murphy as he attempted to speak.
The prime minister, who has been campaigning in Scotland, said people who threw things at politicians had no place in the democratic process.
""I think the responsibility for the people doing these things lies with the people doing these things,"" said Mr Cameron, who was visiting a Royal Navy supplier in Midlothian.
""I've always thought that it isn't right to throw eggs at people - I had one myself in Cornwall once, it's an interesting experience - and I'm sure other party leaders would take the same view.""
The prime minister added: ""It's a vigorous debate with lots of argument, there's nothing wrong with a bit of heckling but throwing things isn't necessarily part of the democratic process.""
Mr Salmond said people had ""every entitlement to peaceful protest"", but added: ""People shouldn't throw eggs at somebody full stop, that's something that happens in elections.
""I remember John Prescott getting a bit energised about it in a UK election. It shouldn't happen - I don't think it's at the serious end of things - but it shouldn't happen.""
The Scottish first minister also recalled a ""road rage"" incident, in which he said he was tailed by another motorist waving a ""No"" sign at him, as a ""very bad example"" of what could happen in political campaigns.
Mr Salmond also said no responsible politician should seek to take advantage of such protests, as he insisted the overwhelming majority of Scots were ""enjoying the most invigorating, scintillating, exciting debate in our political history"".
He added: ""I don't make the death threats from a few daft people I've had an issue, because I know know 99.9% of people in Scotland are enjoying and being energised by a wonderful political debate.""
A spokesperson for Yes Scotland said: 'We condemn all forms of abusive, dangerous and offensive behaviour, whether it be Jim Murphy having eggs thrown at him, or Alex Salmond being harassed by a road rage motorist.
""For the most part, the independence debate has been conducted in a responsible, peaceful and enthusiastic manner with only a very small minority on both sides behaving badly.
""The eyes of the world are on Scotland and it is vital that everybody - regardless of which side of the debate they are on - helps to show off Scotland at its best.""
The Courier newspaper reported on Wednesday that Mr Murphy had been verbally abused while campaigning on the streets of Dundee and Montrose.
Also on Wednesday, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown had a speech in Dundee interrupted by a pro-independence protestor.","Labour MP Jim Murphy has suspended his Scotland-wide tour ahead of the independence referendum, citing ""co-ordinated abuse"" from ""Yes"" voters."

"The defence ministry had been told to develop plans for a ""modest military industrial complex,"" the president, who came to power in May, said
Nigeria has been battling the militant Islamist group Boko Haram for the last six years.
The US has refused to sell arms to Nigeria citing human rights abuses.
President Buhari told a gathering of newly graduated military officers that Nigeria ""must evolve viable mechanisms for near-self-sufficiency"" in defence equipment that it usually imports.
On a visit to Washington last month, Mr Buhari said that the US had ""aided and abetted"" Boko Haram in the past by refusing to sell weapons to Nigeria.
A US law prevents the government from selling arms to countries which fail to tackle human rights abuses.
On Tuesday, a group of visiting US Congress members said Washington could lift its ban on shipping arms to Nigeria's military if the country improved its human rights record.
The US's stance has effectively stopped other Western countries from selling sophisticated military hardware to the country, the BBC's Bashir Sa'ad Abdullahi reports from the capital, Abuja.
Nigeria's only weapons factory in the northern city of Kaduna mainly produces rifles and civilian tools, Mr Buhari's spokesman Garba Shehu told the Reuters news agency.
He said that defence chiefs had now been asked to ""re-engineer"" it.
Boko Haram has killed some 10,000 people since 2009 and has also kidnapped hundreds of girls and women.
Last month, human rights group Amnesty International said that some 8,000 men and boys had died in Nigerian military custody after being detained as suspected militants.
The military rejected this allegation and Mr Buhari promised an investigation, although there have been no further details.

"Andorra had stunned Chris Coleman's side by taking a sixth-minute lead through Ildefons Lima's penalty, Andorra's first competitive goal since 2010.
Bale headed Wales level 16 minutes later, though that did not spare Coleman the jeers of the furious travelling Welsh fans as the score remained 1-1 at half-time.
Wales searched desperately for a winner, and their reprieve eventually came after 81 minutes when Bale curled in a beautiful free-kick to deny Andorra a first competitive point for nine years.
Although a victory of any sort was welcome, the Welsh performance was distinctly unconvincing as they aim to qualify for the finals stage of a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup.
There had been optimism leading up to this campaign, with Euro 2016 expanded from 16 to 24 teams for the first time and Wales drawn alongside Bosnia, Belgium, Israel, Cyprus and Andorra in their qualifying group.
Wales could hardly have asked for a kinder opening fixture - a trip to an Andorran side who are ranked 199th in the world, 158 places below them in the standings, and have lost their last 44 competitive games.
But to Wales' horror, the prospect of a first competitive win for Andorra since 2004 seemed soberingly real as the hosts took an unexpected lead.
With Wales unable to clear from a long Andorran throw, Neil Taylor was adjudged to have pulled the shirt of Ivan Lorenzo.
Prompted by Mitja Zganec - the additional assistant referee behind the goal - Slovenian referee Slavko Vincic pointed to the spot and Andorra captain Lima calmly converted by sending Wayne Hennessey the wrong way.
While Wales' travelling contingent of around 1,500 were momentarily silenced, the other half of the 3,300-capacity Estadio Nacional roared in disbelieving rapture.
The lead lasted only 16 minutes, as Bale headed into the bottom corner from a tantalising cross from left-back Ben Davies.
Bale had inevitably been the focus of pre-match attention, with the £85m Real Madrid winger expected to start as centre-forward.
Coleman instead picked the world's most expensive footballer on his favoured right flank, but he showed the goalscoring instinct of a natural striker to nod Wales level.
The visitors enjoyed near total domination of possession, albeit a little unsteadily at times as players familiarised themselves with the erratic bounce of Andorra's controversial 3G pitch.
With the artificial surface's rubber pellets flying up every time the ball hit the ground, Wales made hard work of creating genuine scoring opportunities.
Having been booed off the field at half time, Coleman sought to take the initiative by switching to a 3-5-2 formation at the beginning of the second half.
There was more urgency to the Welsh performance after the restart, and Bale was the catalyst for the change in pace.
He had a free-kick from distance saved by Ferran Pol and a long-range effort which fizzed just wide, while his cross was headed wide by Andy King.
There were times when Wales' desperation to take the lead led to a loss of shape and rhythm, as players struggled to adapt to tactical changes.
Coleman continued to tinker - replacing his only striker Simon Church with midfielder Joe Ledley to leave Bale as the most advanced player in a makeshift attack.
And when the breakthrough eventually came, it was no surprise that Bale was once again the saviour.
After substitute George Williams was fouled 25 yards from goal, Bale whipped the ball brilliantly beyond Pol to spare Coleman and his side a major embarrassment.
In the only other match in Group B on Tuesday, Bosnia lost 2-1 at home to Cyprus.

"John Whittingdale was speaking on BBC One's The Andrew Marr Show after launching a debate on what types of programmes the BBC should make.
Of Strictly, he said: ""The BBC took a risk. It paid off well and it has achieved a mass audience.
""And that seems to me admirable if you can do all those things.""
The government published a Green Paper on the future of the BBC on Thursday, including the question of whether the corporation should be ""chasing ratings"" or delivering ""distinctive, quality"" programmes that are unavailable on other channels.
That has led to some suggestions that the BBC could stop showing Saturday night light entertainment programmes.
Asked about the difference between Strictly and the BBC's long-running Generation Game, Mr Whittingdale said: ""Saturday night has always been a time when families sit around the television and we traditionally have had light entertainment shows.
""In many ways, Strictly Come Dancing is the successor to The Generation Game.
""But Strictly was perhaps, at first sight of the commissioning editor, not necessarily a show which was going to be as successful as it has proved to be.
""So I think the BBC took a risk. It paid off well and it has achieved a mass audience. And that seems to me admirable if you can do all those things.
""But, of course, in the age when you and I were sitting watching The Generation Game, the amount of choice available was extremely limited.
""At that time there were probably only about three channels, whereas now you've got 50, 60, 70 to choose from.""
Before becoming culture secretary, Mr Whittingdale had told the Guardian newspaper that it was ""debatable"" whether there was a public service argument for the BBC making Strictly.
The show should certainly not compete for viewers with X Factor on ITV, he told the paper.
On Sunday, Mr Whittingdale told Andrew Marr he was a ""huge admirer"" of the BBC.
But he said he was ""a little surprised that the BBC expressed such disappointment at the Green Paper"".
He said the document was ""just a series of questions with no answers as yet decided"".
Almost 30 celebrities, including Daniel Craig and Dame Judi Dench, have signed a letter warning against creating ""a diminished BBC"".
But some of the signatories have revealed that they were asked to sign by BBC executives.
Conservative MP Andrew Bridgend told the Sunday Express the BBC's director of television Danny Cohen should resign over the matter because it broke the BBC's lobbying guidelines.
In his interview on Sunday, Mr Whittingdale did not refer to the row but said he ""fully agreed with"" most of the letter's contents.
He added: ""I admire the BBC. The last thing I want to do is undermine the BBC.""","Strictly Come Dancing is an ""admirable"" example of where the BBC took a risk on a show that was not guaranteed to be a hit, the culture secretary has said."
"Teachers, doctors and nurses were among who stopped work because they had not been paid in more than a month.
It comes a day ahead of a suggested national shutdown called by activists complaining about the economy and alleged government corruption.
Police used teargas and water cannons to break up protests in some areas of the capital, Harare, on Monday.
The unrest had begun when minibus drivers erected barricades in a protest against harassment and roadblocks by police demanding bribes.
Teachers, doctors and nurses have not been paid for a month, but the government has said they will get their wages by the middle of July, Reuters news agency has reported.
The scene in the country's capital, Harare, resembled a quiet Sunday afternoon, with civil servants on strike, the BBC's Brian Hungwe reports.

""It's always difficult coming in half-term, so to speak, during the January transfer window, but he's integrated well within the squad - there's no issues in terms of that.""

"No advantage was being sought for Britain's 264 athletes in Rio, he said.
Concerns have been raised that some Paralympic athletes are being deliberately mismatched.
But Hollingsworth said: ""We are here to win medals, but within both the letter and the spirit of the Paralympics.""
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, an 11-time Paralympic champion, has said the issue ""goes to the heart of the integrity of the sport"".
The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) says the system is always under review, while UK Athletics said it will review classifications after Rio.
The Paralympics start on 7 September and run until 18 September.
The classification system puts athletes into groups depending on the level of their impairment to try to ensure fair competition.
But British T37 200m sprinter Bethany Woodward told the Sunday Times she was withdrawing from the ParalympicsGB squad for Rio and had lost faith in the way the team was selected.
Woodward, 23, who has cerebral palsy, said: ""I represented my country for a long time but if I can't compete like I used to compete, because they've brought in people who are not like me in terms of disability, what's the point?""
UK Athletics has said that Woodward was not in consideration for selection because she had not met the necessary criteria.
It has also been claimed some competitors try to manipulate their classification to compete against athletes with more severe impairments and therefore improve their chances of success.
A recent IPC report found no clear evidence of ""intentional misrepresentation"" after analysing some 80 cases.

IPC head Sir Philip Craven has defended the classification system but told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""permanently being reviewed"".
""It is a developing system and a developing science,"" he said.
Asked whether there was a ""risk"" some countries were too keen on winning medals, Craven said he would not ""respond to that question"", adding: ""All countries are very keen on performing well and performing within the rules.""
Former Paralympic swimmer Natalie Jones said classifying athletes was a ""really hard job"", with more than 4,000 athletes to test worldwide.
But Hollingsworth insisted: ""We are very focused on getting the right athletes in the right class. We've got nobody going into the Games in our view who doesn't have the appropriate classification.
""I dispute a view that what has been discussed over the last few days should lead to conclusion there is anything along those lines going on.""
Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson told BBC Radio 5 live:
The reality is athletes will fall one side of the line or the other and that's what happens when you have these groupings.
The old system used to be very disability specific. They're moving it to sports-specific so it's how your impairment affects you doing that sport.
There's a system in place and athletes have to have faith and people watching have to have faith that the system is right. It doesn't mean it doesn't evolve and doesn't change and need to be looked at from time to time to check it's OK.
We have to take it on trust that the athletes are in the right class.",Claims that the classification system for disabled athletes is being manipulated to boost medal chances has been rejected by British Paralympic Association boss Tim Hollingsworth.

The world number two expects to be back on court as early as January 2018.
Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.
Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.
King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.
But later that year, the top-ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.

"IS ""fired at everything that moved"" after entering on Thursday, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.
A separate IS attack on the north-eastern city of Hassakeh has displaced 60,000 people, the UN says.
Kobane became a symbol of Kurdish resistance in January after an IS siege lasting several months was repelled.
IS launched an apparent two-pronged offensive on Thursday after Kurdish fighters from the Popular Protection Units (YPG) cut off one of the militants' major supply routes near Raqqa.
Raqqa is the de facto capital of the IS ""caliphate"", whose creation IS announced a year ago after it captured large swathes of northern and western Iraq and parts of Syria.
""According to medical sources and Kobane residents, 120 civilians were executed by IS in their homes or killed by the group's rockets or snipers,"" said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the UK-based Observatory.
He said women and children were among the bodies found inside houses and on the streets of the town, which is close to the border with Turkey.
He described it as one of the biggest massacres by the group in the country since its offensive began last summer.
The militants took the town by surprise when they launched their attack on Thursday, five months after IS was removed by Kurdish fighters backed by US-led coalition strikes.
The attack at dawn on Thursday began when militants detonated a car bomb, followed by two more bombings.
Reports said some of the militants may have hidden themselves among returning refugees and disguised themselves by wearing Kurdish militia uniforms.
In a nearby village, IS reportedly shot dead at least 20 civilians, including women and children.
Activists say clashes between some IS militants and the Kurdish YPG forces are continuing in the town.
Separately on Friday, the UN said an estimated 50,000 people had been displaced within the city of Hassakeh after another IS offensive there. Another 10,000 have fled northwards towards a town near the Turkish border, it added.
Hassakeh, about 270km (180 miles) east of Kobane, has been under the control of both government forces and Kurdish fighters, and IS militants have been trying to capture it for months.
Overall, in four years of armed conflict in Syria, more than 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 11 million others have been forced from their homes.","Islamic State (IS) militants have killed more than 120 civilians since launching a fresh attack on the Syrian border town of Kobane, activists say."

"Dr Mark Lang spent six months studying the Lansbury Park Estate, near Caerphilly town centre.
He said many policies aimed at reducing poverty in Wales had failed to work.
Council officials have accepted Dr Lang's findings which include offering learning opportunities outside the classroom.
Lansbury Park has already lived with the label ""Wales' most deprived area"" for the past two years.
Now, the major economic research centred on the community suggests there needs to be fresh thinking about how we tackle the poorest places in Wales.
Poverty is on the increase in Wales amongst children, working age adults and pensioners, despite attempts to reduce it over decades, according to the Bevan Foundation think-tank.
It calculates that dealing with the consequences of poverty is now costing the Welsh public purse £1 out of every £5 it spends.
Those findings are now swiftly followed by a report into Lansbury Park, which advocates a new approach but no magic wand.
It is nearly 25 years since a range of social and economic problems were first highlighted by research on the estate, which lies just a mile from Caerphilly town centre.
More recently, Lansbury succeeded part of Rhyl to a title no one wants - officially ranked as Wales' most deprived community.
If you walk through the estate - home to 2,200 people -  very little has changed on the surface from how it looked decades ago.
Lansbury was named after a Labour leader of the Depression era when it was built in the 1960s and Attlee Court in the middle is among reminders of other figures from the party's past.
Caerphilly council since 1996 has been under both Labour and Plaid Cymru control.
This ""deep place"" study was commissioned by the local authority and its analysis does not apportion blame - only recognising the approaches of a generation or more have simply not worked.
Despite money being spent, and a Communities First programme running, economic and social problems have become ""embedded"".
Dr Mark Lang spent six months working on the Lansbury Park ""deep place"" study, with Prof Dave Adamson, who led the original research in 1993.
Beyond the stark economic statistics, the research looks at less tangible but equally relevant factors.
Indeed, the ""feel"" of the place is possibly as much of an obstacle to progress.
The ""sterile"" urban landscape, the lack of trees on the little green space the estate has, are all features; horizons are limited, physically and emotionally.
So as new councillors are soon elected across Wales, are there lessons for similar urban areas too? Especially at a time of austerity, council budget pressures, uncertainty over filling future gaps left by European funding and the forthcoming overhaul of Communities First.
Dr Lang believes it is about understanding the specifics of a place - and spending what money there is, more wisely.
""With some of the funded activities, I feel, they don't take the community out of itself; they don't encourage people to leave their communities and do something somewhere else, experience a broader world,"" he said.
""It might well be you spend the same money on supporting activities but you spend it differently, more intelligently.
""If you take people out of their community and engage in activities not inside it, you can broaden people's horizons and aspirations.
""That in itself will lead on to people wanting to gain more skills and better skills. We need to break through those barriers.""
Engaging hard-to-reach men in their 20s and 30s is the biggest challenge for those already running programmes to get people both fit and into work.
Even the ""stick"" of recent welfare reforms has not had a spike in more people joining programmes on the estate, compared with other parts of the town.
Those that do are helped towards interviews in construction, security and call centre work. Cardiff is only 40 minutes away by train and groups have been given work experience as part of their training.
The low level of educational attainment - more than half without any qualifications - is a worry if Lansbury is not to stay at the back of the queue.
More than half the pupils at the local primary school, St James, qualify for free school meals and last year's inspection report found overall it was ""adequate"" but called for an improvement in reading and writing standards, as well as attendance and punctuality.
There is a new head teacher in charge but the challenge is continuing and goes beyond the classroom.
The visual impact of the estate is something all are conscious of. There is something of a time-warp about the 1960s flats and homes, all in uniform colour.
That is changing with a £10m housing programme over the next 18 months, which includes 320 council properties getting £2m of new external cladding.
Another £500,000 will go on environmental improvements and demolition has started of an ""eyesore"" footbridge.
Sian Denatale has lived at Lansbury for 18 years and four of her five children still live on the estate. One works part-time for a retailer and another works in a nearby food factory.
""It has changed a lot - for the better,"" she said. ""There's a massive sense of community, everyone pulls together. But we need help to improve the area like they're doing with the housing.
""Parks and a resource centre would be nice, an internet cafe for the older children - they go up town, hanging around the streets and the station, anything could happen.""
Lorna Wellington, who grew up on the estate from the age of seven, moved to live a mile away but still comes back for an exercise class at the community centre and most of her friends are still on the estate.
""Lansbury's had a bad name for many, many years but you are who you are - there are other places just as bad,"" she said.
Heidi Wilkie added: ""It's unjustified. I never felt lonely, there was never that isolation, you always had someone to fall back on, you could always walk down the street and knock on someone's door.""
Council officials accept Dr Lang's findings and said all organisations involved have to adopt a mature approach, recognising past failures.
It was not just about more money and investing in buildings but focusing support on making an impact on people themselves.
""It's a cycle, if people say you're not good enough, you believe you're not good enough, and around it goes and we have to intervene,"" said Christina Harrhy, Caerphilly Council's corporate director for communities.
""The jobs and opportunities are out there, it's a fantastic location and with transport infrastructure changes we're going to be more accessible to Cardiff and the wider region - this community just needs the belief in themselves.""
The report makes 22 recommendations, which includes offering learning opportunities outside the classroom and chances for young people to widen social horizons.
It also suggests involving the whole community in activities - not just singling out disadvantaged groups.
The phasing out of Communities First - but with legacy funding of £6m from 2018 - reflected a view from a significant number that far-reaching reform was needed with ministers pointing towards a ""new approach focused on employment, early years and empowerment"".
Dr Lang said the lesson for Lansbury and other poor areas is that it might take 15 years to make a real impact.
""There's not a silver bullet which will miraculously improve things overnight,"" he said.
""There's a multiplicity of things you need to do, some small, some big, to assist this community to grow, to re-integrate into the economy and improve household income levels.
""That's not going to happen overnight, it's a long term challenge, a multi-generational challenge and you have to be honest from day one how long it's going to take and the scale of the challenge. If you do that, you can move on.""","A new approach is needed to tackle poverty, a report into the most deprived community in Wales has suggested."

"Barrister Mona Bayoumi's comments come as a Welsh Assembly committee holds an inquiry into human rights in Wales.
The committee said its inquiry is instrumental in ensuring the assembly is prepared for future changes.
A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the UK government was ""committed"" to reforming domestic human rights.
Speaking to Sunday Politics Wales, Ms Bayoumi said: ""Just to put it in to some context, there was obviously existing UK legislation going back to the 70s that protected, for example, employee rights in respect of discrimination, so it's important to remember that.
""But yes absolutely, I do think that there will be a slow erosion of the existing rights and protections, that really is in line with the debate that we've heard.""
The UK government has proposed replacing the Human Rights Act 1998, which could curtail the role of the European Court of Human Rights.
The assembly's Equality Committee is looking at how this could affect Wales.
All Welsh Assembly laws must comply with human rights legislation, and with Theresa May repeatedly saying Britain would be better served by leaving the European Convention on Human Rights, the terms of the legislation could change.

Wales has to ""guard against that"", he said.
Mr Griffiths acknowledged there was an issue with how the public view human rights laws, following recent debates about votes for prisoners and human rights regulations blocking criminals from being deported.
""There can be a problem with public perception but it can mainly come, I think, from media sensationalism around fairly atypical cases,"" he said.
""I think if we look at the general experience and well beyond Wales, their everyday lives are improved, their rights are safeguarded and protected by that human rights approach and the international standards that apply.""
Stonewall's Mabli Jones raised concerns that possible changes to legislature could undo the progress of LGBT rights.
""Since the introduction of the Human Rights Act there have been several rulings in UK and EU courts which have advanced legal protections for LGBT people,"" she said.
""Our concern is that without those protections we could see progress go back decades.""
A MoJ spokesman said the UK government would consider the Bill of Rights further ""once we know the arrangements for our EU exit"" and would ""consult fully on our proposals in the full knowledge of the new constitutional landscape that will create"".","Current political attitudes are likely to lead to a ""slow erosion"" of existing human rights and protections, according to an expert."
"The gulf in class between the teams was evident as Bernard Brogan's goal helped the Dubs lead 1-13 to 0-6 by half-time.
Dublin led by 13 when Fermanagh scored a dubious goal as Sean Quigley pushed Stephen Cluxton over his own goal-line.
Paul Flynn quickly netted for Dublin although Tomas Corrigan hit a late second Erne goal after a mix-up.
Corrigan's goal came in injury-time as Cluxton and a Dublin defender left the ball to each other after a Fermanagh shot had been blocked which allowed Corrigan to nip in and slam into the empty net.

The three late goals lifted the atmosphere at Croke Park with Dublin fans annoyed by Quigley's controversial goal and Fermanagh's supporters delighted by the spirit shown by their team.
Peter McGrath, rightly, praised his team's refusal to submit to the heavy defeat that looked likely for the majority of the contest.
But while Dublin Jim Gavin will note his team's late sloppiness, the job in hand of qualifying for a semi-final meeting with either Mayo or Donegal on 30 August had been achieved.
Some bookmakers had rated the Dubs as 1-200 to win Sunday's contest and pundits had suggested that a Fermanagh victory would have represented the biggest shock in GAA history.
In the event, Fermanagh had 59% of the possession in the first half but were still decidedly second best as Dublin's pace, movement and shooting, had them chasing shadows for the most part.
Quigley's first score cancelled out late Dublin inclusion Paddy Andrews's opening point but two Ciaran Kilkenny efforts helped the Leinster champions lead 0-4 to 0-1 before Brogan netted a glorious opening goal.
Brogan was given far too much space by marker Niall Cassidy as he was picked out by a glorious long ball from Jack McCaffrey before coolly slotting past Thomas Treacy.
Fermanagh did fire eight first-half wides but several of the shots were speculative whereas the Dubs were able to work the ball into genuine scoring positions seemingly at will.
Barry Mulrone did show his colleagues how to hit the target as he struck a couple of fine efforts from play.
However, Dublin's slick play was emphasised by their 1-13 first-half total all coming from play as Brogan hit 1-4 and Dean Rock and the impressive Diarmuid Connolly both contributing 0-2.
It was largely more of the same in the third quarter with free-taker Rock, Brogan and Andrews all on target on multiple occasions.

Brian Fenton's point in the 59th minute increased Dublin's advantage to 1-21 to 0-11 as the game seemed to be petering out only for Cluxton's controversial own goal to stir some passions.
Quite how the Fermanagh goal was allowed to stand is anyone's guess as Quigley clearly pushed a bemused Cluxton over the line with the umpire eventually waving his green flag after consulting with referee Padraig O'Sullivan.
Quigley's subsequent laughter indicated his amazement that the goal had been allowed to stand.
Dublin, however, didn't see the funny side and within two minutes the ball was in the net at the other end as Rock and Brogan combined to set up Flynn to palm to the net.
Fermanagh sub Conal Jones was given space to kick two fine points from distance before the Ernemen scored another bizarre goal in injury-time as Corrigan blasted home as Cluxton and his defenders left the ball to each other.

"During July - the first full month after the Brexit vote - 60,912 new mortgages were approved.
That was down from 64,152 approvals in June, and was the lowest total since January 2015.
The total amount lent out for house purchases was £10.4bn, down from £11.1bn in June.
The figures also show a 12.4% drop in the number of mortgage approvals on the same month a year ago.
The number of approvals has been falling steadily since March, when there was a rush to buy ahead of tax changes.
""Mortgage approvals for house purchases have progressively slowed after being buoyed in the first quarter by buy-to-let and second home sectors rushing to beat April's Stamp Duty increase for these sectors,"" said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at IHS Global Insight.
""It is also highly possible that mortgage activity was hit in July by heightened uncertainty following June's vote for Brexit.""
The Bank of England figures also show that growth in the amount being borrowed by consumers on credit cards and other loans eased off in July.
UK residents borrowed an extra £1.2bn during the month - down from £1.9bn in June, and 17% less than in July 2015.
This is the first time that growth in unsecured consumer credit has slowed since December 2014.
However, credit card lending by itself rose by £0.5bn in July to a record of £65.5bn.
""We remain concerned that while most households will be able to handle this extra borrowing, a minority of households could find themselves exposed to financial difficulty,"" said Joanna Elson, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust.

"The 15cm high concrete wall is topped with razor wire, miniature US flags and includes 'Keep Out' signs written in both Spanish and English.
It was created by LA-based street artist Plastic Jesus and was inspired by comments made by the Republican Presidential nominee last year when he outlined plans to build a wall along the US-Mexico border to stop illegal immigrants.
Curious tourists snapped photographs of the Los Angeles structure, while a picture of the unusual artwork posted on the artist's Instagram account received more than 14,000 likes by Thursday morning.
One person called the wall ""the most genius vandalism of the star yet,"" while another said it was the ""best thing I've seen all day.""
There were also those who were unimpressed by the Trump-attacking artwork, with one user exclaiming that ""A Trump presidency is what the US needs.""
In an interview with the BBC, Plastic Jesus explained why he had built the 'wall':
""I wanted to create a piece that drew attention to [Trump's] potential policies,"" he says. ""I knew this week was the republican convention and I suppose I was capitalising on the momentum of the convention.""
And so, on Tuesday afternoon he took his tiny wall made from wood and concrete, and placed it on top of Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
He says the response to his wall has been largely supportive. ""I went to Hollywood Boulevard yesterday to take photographs and found myself in an absolute bottleneck of people taking photographs of the piece - it's been absolutely crazy.""
The artist, who emigrated to the US from the UK nine years ago, says he's not a fan of Donald Trump, ""In the US you'll interact with immigrants from all over the world and it's one of the things that makes the US so great. Donald Trump's policy proposals are a threat to all of the immigrants.""

"Police said 26-year-old Bamilola Kazim was allegedly assaulted by Mohammed Gafoor after a row on Wednesday
Mr Kazim was treated for wounds at a local hospital and released.
Last week a student from the Democratic Republic of Congo was beaten to death by a group of Indian men after an argument in Delhi.
Two men have been arrested in connection with the killing of the Congolese man.
Indian foreign ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup  tweeted on Friday that Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj ""had urgently sought report"" on Wednesday's incident from the local government ""and is monitoring the case"".
Police said Mr Kazim allegedly parked his car in front of Mr Gafoor's house, and was attacked with an iron rod by the latter after an altercation.
""We have arrested the accused and the matter is now in court,"" Hyderabad police officer K Krishnaiah told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi.
Gideon Omodowale of the local Nigerian Students Association said it was a ""racial issue"".
""If he was a US citizen or an Indian, he wouldn't have been attacked. Later, some community people came and he [Mr Gafoor] apologised. We are ready to drop the case because we don't want it to affect other Africans,"" he told the BBC.
There are more than 4,000 students from African countries in Hyderabad.
Following last week's killing of an African student in Delhi, a group of African embassies had said they did not want to participate in Africa Day celebrations on Thursday because of repeated attacks on African students in India.
They relented after Ms Swaraj promised to ensure the safety of African students in India.
Mr Swarup said the Indian government had received news from its embassy in Kinshasa, the capital of Democratic Republic of Congo, that some ""Indian establishments and shops were attacked on 23 and 25 May as a reaction perhaps to the killing of the Congolese national"" in Delhi.
""It has been reported that by Wednesday, things have calmed down,"" Mr Swarup was quoted as saying by The Hindu newspaper.

"The Legged Squad Support System - referred to by some as ""the big dog"" - is capable of carrying 400lbs (181.4kg) of equipment over rugged terrain.
But the US Marines now say its petrol-powered engine is too noisy for them to use in battle.
Google has long said it planned to move away from its military contracts.
The LS3 was developed by Boston Dynamics - a robotics firm acquired by Google in 2013 - as part of a tie-up with the Pentagon's research arm, the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa).
The robot can follow troops on foot through rugged terrain, carrying their gear.
It can also interpret verbal and visual commands.
However, after a major field trial in 2014, flaws in the robot also became apparent, according to Kyle Olson, a spokesman for the Marines' Warfighting Lab.
""There was the challenge of seeing [its] potential... because of the limitations of the robot itself,"" he told Military.com.
""They took it as it was: a loud robot that's going to give away their position.""
The machine, which has a gas-powered engine, is said to emit a lawnmower-like noise that would be unviable in combat situations.
It is also thought to be difficult to repair.
In response, Boston Dynamics did create a quieter, electric-powered alternative, called Spot. But despite successful trials in September 2015, the Marines have decided not to take it forward either.
This, they said, was because Spot is smaller, can only carry up to 40lbs, and lacks the automation capacity of the LS3.
Google said as far back as 2013 that it planned to move away from its military contracts, which it inherited as part of its acquisition of the company.
The tech firm has said it intends to develop robots for use in manufacturing and industry instead.
Noel Sharkey, co-director of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, told the BBC: ""Spot ... lacks the autonomous operation of Big Dog, but that really is not so much of a problem and would not require a vast amount of research.
""The problem is that to take the extra steps need to upgrade the battery-driven Spot to the level of Big Dog could require a couple of years development or more and thus a new Darpa contract.
""So, what this looks like is a face saving statement by the Marine Corps to make it look like they are dumping Google/Boston Dynamics before they they got dumped themselves.""","The US army says it has mothballed plans to deploy a robot developed in conjunction with Google because it is ""too loud""."
"James Lang's penalty with four seconds remaining sealed victory after Ross and James Chisholm crossed for tries to help level the scores 27-27 following Richard Hibbard's sin-binning.
Gloucester scored 17 unanswered second-half points, fighting back from 15-10 down to build the game's biggest lead.
Hibbard's yellow, however, was costly.
Moments after the hooker was sin-binned for a penalty at the scrum, James Chisholm went over to give the Londoners renewed hope of taking something from the game against their fellow top-six hopefuls.
A slick passing move, which involved Marland Yarde and Alofa Alofa, put the older of the Chisholm brothers, Ross, over in the 75th minute.
And while 21-year-old fly-half Lang was off target with his conversion attempt, a penalty at the scrum with moments remaining allowed him a shot from right in front to win it.
It was an enthralling finish to a match which started with Charlie Sharples going over for the hosts, only for Gloucester to be punished for failing to make more of their strong start, as Tim Visser touched down on his return from Scotland duty and Charlie Mulchrone helped edge Quins ahead before the break.
Billy Burns landed his third kick of the game to convert David Halaifonua's try and restore the hosts' lead after half-time, with Sharples grabbing his second try of the game as Gloucester quickly built a comfortable lead.
The one-man advantage was ruthlessly exploited late on as Quins move to within two points of Northampton in sixth, while a losing bonus point leaves Gloucester ninth in the table and eight points adrift of a European Champions Cup spot.
Gloucester director of rugby David Humphreys:
""It's a sense of frustration, anger and disappointment after those last six or seven minutes of madness.
""We led by two scores and had to get the basics right but our defence and set-piece went to pieces after we had controlled the second half.
""European qualification is still mathematically possible but we had to get four or five points today and we didn't so it's a massive blow for the squad, especially after a great win over Saracens in our last home game.""
Harlequins director of rugby John Kingston:
""At the end of the first half we led 15-10, but we were much the better side and should have been further in front. They then had a good period but we came back strongly and deserved to win.
""We knew we had to control the environment today as the influence of the crowd is very important here. I thought we managed to do so, for which the leaders in our team must take great credit.
""We've kept our European Cup hopes alive as finishing sixth or maybe seventh will be enough to secure us a spot for next season.""

"The screens of the Galaxy S8 and bigger S8+ are also larger despite the devices being about the same size as last year's S7 and S7 Edge.
This time, both models feature displays that curve round the phones' sides.
The launch follows Samsung's botched release of the Note 7, which was recalled twice after fires.
The South Korean firm blamed the problem on battery faults and said it had since put in additional safety measures, including X-ray scans of  batteries.
The company has also become mired in a corruption scandal in its home country.
""The Galaxy S8 is arguably the most important launch of the last 10 years for Samsung and every aspect will be under the microscope following the Note 7 recall,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS tech consultancy.
""The S8 is a unquestionably a strong product but Samsung must now deliver a faultless launch to move on from its earlier difficulties. If this happens it will emerge in an even stronger position.""
The new devices will be released on 21 April.
The S8 is priced at £690 and the S8+ at £780 - a jump on last year's entry prices of £569 for the S7 and £639 for the S7 Edge.
Samsung was the bestselling handset manufacturer for 2016 as a whole, according to market research firm IDC.
However, Apple overtook it in the final three months.
Source: IDC
The displays of the S8 and S8+, measuring 5.8in (14.7cm) and 6.2in (15.7cm) respectively, mean a more stretched aspect ratio than before, pushing the screens closer to the top and bottom of the handsets.
As a consequence, Samsung's logo no longer features on the front, and the physical home button is replaced with an on-screen icon - in a similar manner to rival Android phones from Huawei and LG.
A pressure sensor and vibration module have, however, been built into the space behind the new virtual button to provide feedback.
Samsung suggests the displays' 18.5:9 ratio makes them better suited to running two apps side by side. For example, there is now space to watch a video, use a chat app and still have room for a full touch-keyboard.
The screens are the same resolution as before but are now brighter, supporting high dynamic range (HDR) playback of videos for extra clarity.
The S8's body is a little narrower than that of the S7, while the S8+'s is a bit wider than the S7 Edge but lighter - Samsung says both new devices can still be used one-handed.
The phones also introduce Bixby - a virtual assistant based on technology acquired from some of the original developers' of Apple's Siri.
The helper is activated by a dedicated side-button and allows 10 built-in apps - including a photo gallery, messages and weather - to be controlled by voice.
It is ""context-aware"", meaning users can ask follow-up questions and assume it is aware of what is currently displayed.
Samsung said it expected owners to mix together voice commands and physical controls - for example asking to see all the photos taken today, then tapping the ones they want, before verbally requesting they be messaged to a friend.
The software can also be used to recognise objects seen via the phone's camera. This can be used to identify a landmark, for example, or tell the owner how much a product would cost to buy online.
Bixby works with Google Play Music, and Samsung intends to open it up to other third-party apps in the future but has not said when.
At launch, it is only designed to recognise US and Korean voices.
""If what Samsung demoed works well in practice, Bixby will be interesting because it offers features absent from Siri and Google Assistant,"" commented Francisco Jeronimo from IDC.
""The race is on to have the best digital assistant, since that will drive hardware sales.
""But in the past, some of Samsung's features have looked great in presentations, but when you use them on a daily basis they have not been as good.""
While Bixby offers new ways to control a phone, it lacks Google Assistant's pre-emptive smarts - it does not interject in chats to suggest places to visit, for example.
However, the search giant's rival artificial intelligence can still be summoned via the home button.
Other improvements over last year's models include:
Samsung also has a range of accessories including a revamped virtual reality headset that is now accompanied by its own motion-sensing controller, and a second-generation 360-degree camera capable of more detailed images than before.
It also offers a new dock that connects the phones to a monitor, keyboard and wireless mouse, allowing them to act as a kind of Android-powered PC.
""Although Microsoft has done this in the past, the performance of the S8 makes it a very compelling experience,"" commented Mr Wood.
""But while I'm impressed with the dock from a technology perspective, the practicality of it for consumers is questionable.""
I'm not sure I share Samsung's bold declaration that the S8 is ""a work of art"" - but the slimmer handset definitely sits more easily in one hand than its predecessor.
And once you see the surface, which is nearly all-screen, you wonder why you ever needed a physical home button or any other furniture around it.
The tech giant has high hopes for its digital assistant Bixby. What I tried was a limited demo model, which only seemed to understand a few predetermined cues such as searching photos and telling you the weather.
The idea of using the camera as Bixby's ""eyes"" is neat - but is it enough to draw people away from the more familiar Google Assistant, which will also be preinstalled, as it is on other Android devices?
I'd like to be able to tell you more about the battery life of what I imagine is a power-hungry little device - but Samsung was coy about that. Batteries are still a sensitive subject.
Samsung Electronics's stock has shrugged off months of bad news, thanks in part to the popularity of last year's Galaxy S7, strong sales of its OLED screens and other components to rival manufacturers, and the fact that investors hope the firm has learned from its mistakes.
Even so, the company will hope its latest launch will demonstrate it has turned a corner.

"Jose Beltrame stood down a day after a high profile clash between police and suspected drug dealers in some of the city's best known neighbourhoods.
The shootout caused panic and forced shops to closed their doors on Monday.
Police say three men were killed and several arrested in the raid on the Pavao-Pavaozinho shantytown.
Dramatic footage posted online shows one of the suspected criminals falling off a mountain after being shot by police.
Pavao-Pavaozinho is built on the hills and granite mountains that divide the Copacabana, Ipanema and Lagoa neighbourhoods.
Mr Beltrame led a controversial programme that saw the occupation of dozens of Rio's favelas by police.
Residents initially welcomed the ""pacification plan,"" and celebrated the arrest or escape of drug lords who controlled life in their communities.
But many eventually turned against the programme after accusing police of abusing their powers.
More than 260 favelas have been occupied since the programme was launched in 2010.
Rio's pacification programme was aimed at improving security and the rule of law in the run-up to Brazil's hosting of the football World Cup in 2014 and Rio's staging of the Olympics and Paralympics , which took place in August and September.
Rio residents say security has declined sharply since the end of the Games.
Mr Beltrame said the first phase of his ""pacification programme"" was to restore law and order in the city's poorest communities.
But he complained that there was no money for the second phase of the programme, which consisted of social improvements for residents, with the construction of schools and leisure facilities.
Brazil is facing a serious economic and political crisis and the state of Rio de Janeiro has been particularly hit by the downturn.",The head of security for the Brazilian state of Rio de Janeiro has resigned after nearly ten years in post following a recent rise in violence.

It is part of the rail management company and Liverpool City Region's Â£340m project to upgrade 10 railways.
A spokesman for Network Rail said disruption would be ""kept to a minimum"" and most services would run to and from Liverpool South Parkway instead.
Annual passenger numbers at Lime Street station are forecast to double in peak periods by 2043, said Network Rail, and these improvements will enable it to cater for the increased capacity.

"Dean Melnyk, 20, and Andrew Brown, 23, were given minimum terms of 20 years for killing Kevin MacKay, 40, in Ecclefechan last August.
A court heard how they  took the law into their own hands hours after the funeral of their friend Jamie Abba.
Lord Armstrong told the pair they had been convicted of a ""brutal attack"".
By Willie JohnstonBBC Scotland
Ecclefechan was quiet this morning as, 80 miles away in Edinburgh, a judge passed sentence on Dean Melnyk and Andrew Brown.  Most people were inside sheltering from the heavy rain; making sure they avoided me and my camera back to film the scene of the crime for TV.
But in a village whose population is less than 1,000 two unnatural deaths in less than a fortnight is going to have an impact and there is no doubt that impact has been severe.
There is tension here.  Police Scotland have worked hard to prevent it bubbling over into further violence, and still are.
Ten months ago, there was understandable shock and grief at the loss of 18-year-old Jamie Abba, apparently after taking a dodgy ecstasy tablet.
But no-one foresaw the next tragic consequences as Dean Melnyk and Andrew Brown turned vigilante killers of the man pinpointed for supplying the fatal drug to their young friend.
Their attack on Kevin MacKay was frenzied, their brutality shocking.
One man who did venture out to speak to me today - albeit off-camera - said the murderers deserved 30 years and should never show face in Ecclefechan again.
The High Court in Edinburgh heard how Melnyk and Brown believed that Mr MacKay had supplied the pill that killed 18-year-old Mr Abba, who was known as Jabba.
So the two men travelled from Lockerbie to Ecclefechan in Dumfries and Galloway and repeatedly stabbed him in a frenzied revenge attack last August.
Judge Lord Armstrong sentenced the two men to life imprisonment.
Passing sentence, he told Melnyk and Brown that they would both have to serve a minimum of 20 years before becoming eligible for parole.
He added: ""You have been convicted of carrying out a brutal attack which resulted in the death of Kevin MacKay.
""This incident did not happen on the spur of the moment.
""It was pre-meditated - you wrongly took justice into your own hands.""
He said they had travelled to the south of Scotland village with bladed weapons to carry out the attack.
""The court has heard that your victim suffered 80 injuries which were inflicted on the vital organs of your victim,"" he said.
""The court has also heard evidence that without immediate medical attention, your victim could not have survived more than five to 10 minutes.
""This was an intensely violent attack. The only sentence for murder is life imprisonment.""
Melnyk, of Lockerbie, and Brown, of Ecclefechan, were convicted of murder following proceedings at the High Court in Glasgow in April.
Speaking after the sentencing, Procurator Fiscal Jennifer Harrower said: ""There is no doubt that Andrew Brown and Dean Melnyk went looking for their victim with the sole intention of doing him serious harm.
""Minutes after finding him Kevin MacKay lay dead, brutally murdered.

"In the Daily Telegraph, Lord Hague said he was asked the question ""for months... everywhere I went abroad"" if ""we would lose heart"" about leaving.
He said he explained to them that ""this really is a democracy"".
Lord Hague also backed a ""transitional"" withdrawal from the EU saying it had ""immense"" attractions.
Lord Hague - who campaigned to remain in the EU - stood down as foreign secretary in 2014, and left the House of Commons in 2015.
He wrote in Tuesday's Telegraph: ""The electorate voted to leave the EU, and therefore we leave.
""What is more, the number of people who voted to do so was higher than the number of votes cast for any government in our history.
""To me and many of my former colleagues in government who preferred to remain, the argument was over.
""In the recent general election, both main parties were clear that they were committed to the referendum outcome.
""Globally, the message has now got through.""
But Lord Hague added that ""just as the message was accepted, the voters pulled off another surprise and refused to give a majority to the ministers negotiating the exit"" [in the general election].
He said there was the clear potential for Brexit to become the ""greatest economic, diplomatic and constitutional muddle in the modern history of the UK, with unknowable consequences for the country, the government and the Brexit project itself"".
And he said the Chancellor Philip Hammond deserved ""great credit"" for putting forward a possible solution.
Lord Hague said: ""He has evidently been trying to persuade his cabinet colleagues that we should be seeking to stay in the EU single market and customs union during a transition and 'implementation' phase lasting to 2022, followed by a free trade deal with our former partners after that.
""This is seen by longstanding advocates of leaving as a 'soft' position or a climbdown.
""But in reality it is a plan to rescue Brexit from an approaching disaster.""
Mr Hammond has said any transitional deal in the period after Brexit must end by June 2022, the time of the next general election.
But the chancellor said there must be ""business as usual, life as normal"" for Britons as the UK left the EU.

"From 1 January cars and motor caravans will pay £6.70 - up 10p - while tolls for small goods vehicles and small buses will rise by 20p to £13.40.
Severn River Crossing raises the prices each year in line with inflation.
Labour MP Jessica Morden said the toll was now nearing the minimum wage, but UK ministers plan to halve the tolls in 2018.
Prices for heavy goods vehicles and buses will rise by 20p to £20.
The average increase is 1.3%, according to the operating company Severn River Crossing plc.
The Severn Bridges Act 1992 allows for the tolls to be amended annually with the agreement of the UK Department for Transport.
Ms Morden, who is MP for Newport East, said: ""For many of my constituents on the Tories' minimum wage, the cost of travelling across the bridge is now almost equivalent to an hour's pay, and is actually above it for people under 21.
""That means they are effectively losing an hour's pay every day that they cross the bridge.""
The government's National Living Wage is currently £7.20, while the minimum wage is £6.95 for 21 to 24-year-olds and £5.55 for 18 to 20-year-olds.
Ms Morden added that the UK government had yet to explain what its plans were for when the bridges return to public ownership - expected around 2018.
""All we know is that the government have announced that the tolls will come down next year when the contract comes to an end, but there is still no sign of the public consultation that was promised,"" she said.
Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said: ""With these higher toll costs about to hit people who are already having to tighten their belts, we now need absolute certainty from the UK government about what exactly is going to happen.""
In March, the then Chancellor George Osborne announced in his budget that the toll charges would be halved in 2018, when the bridges were expected to have been returned to UK government ownership.
Welsh MPs were told by Transport Minister Andrew Jones in July that the switch may come as early as October 2017.
Mr Jones said tolls may still be charged to cover maintenance, but added: ""They are not a cash system... to fund a scheme in Kent or a scheme somewhere else.""
In November, assembly members from all four party groups backed a call to scrap the tolls, condemned by UKIP AM Mark Reckless as a ""tax on Wales"".
However, Labour backbencher Lee Waters argued that the tolls should be kept and used to fund the South Wales Metro project to boost public transport.
A UK government spokesman said it had ""announced its intention to halve the tolls on the River Severn Crossings"".
""We will launch a consultation on the Severn Bridge and confirm further details in due course,"" he added.",Tolls to cross the Severn Bridge and Second Severn Crossing into Wales will increase in the New Year.

"The key element is the goal to limit global warming to below 2C by moving to zero carbon emissions by 2050.
The UN meeting in December is ""the last chance"" to avert dangerous climate change, according to the Earth League.
Scientific evidence shows this can be achieved, but only with bold action now, says an alliance of climate researchers from 17 institutions.
The statement involves eight calls for action:
Chair of the Earth League, Johan Rockstrom, of the Stockholm Resilience Centre in Sweden, said the statement set out the scientific stance on what needed to happen at the Paris talks.
""Six years after the failure at Copenhagen, the world now has a second chance to agree upon a safe pathway towards a future that does not undermine human well-being in the world.""
He said the statement summarised what the group of scientists believe has to happen at the Paris talks to avoid the risk of severe climate change linked with sea-level rise, heat waves, droughts and floods.
""The window is still open but just barely,"" he said. ""There is still an opportunity to transition into a safe, reasonably stable climate future.""
He added: ""The statement says very clearly that 2 degrees is the absolute upper limit that the world should aim for.""
The Earth League includes 17 scientific research institutions around the world, including two in the UK.
Professor Sir Brian Hoskins of the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and the Environment, Imperial College, London, said to achieve the goal, global carbon emissions would need to peak around 2020 and fall very rapidly to near zero by around 2050.
He said rich countries would have to take the lead on this and help the less developed world.
""We're all in this together - we share one planet, we share one atmosphere, we share one climate system.""
The statement was released to coincide with Earth Day, an annual event to demonstrate support for environmental protection.
WWF-UK said governments around the world must agree a fair deal at Paris, but should take action beyond this.
Head of climate and energy policy, Emma Pinchbeck, said: ""The next UK Government must reaffirm our leadership on this key international issue, and commit to decarbonising policy in line with the science.
""When it comes to government action on climate change, we will benefit from ambition and will regret inaction.""",Scientists are calling on world leaders to sign up to an eight-point plan of action at landmark talks in Paris.
"Arguing in Cardiff for a Remain vote, Leanne Wood did not think her side had lost but said: ""It's close"".
She was speaking alongside ex-Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, who said the positive case for the EU had been missing from the campaign.
But Commons leader Chris Grayling, in Caerphilly, said the Brexit case was an ""overwhelmingly positive one"".
He was campaigning in the south Wales valleys for a Leave vote alongside Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies, Monmouth Tory MP David Davies, and UKIP AMs Nathan Gill and Mark Reckless.
The two sides have been stepping up their campaigns with just one week to go before the UK's in-out referendum on 23 June.
Talking to BBC Wales in Cardiff city centre on Thursday, Mr Salmond agreed the vote was close, describing it as ""nip and tuck"".
""There's going to be a strong remain vote in Scotland as in Northern Ireland,"" he said.
""I'm hoping for a Remain vote in Wales to make it a Celtic triple, as it were.
""It's on a knife edge in England.""
Mr Salmond predicted a ""surge of European enthusiasm"" as ""you go deep into the European football championships"".
""What the campaign has been missing has been the positive aspect of Europe,"" he said.
Claiming the EU had been a force for peace and prosperity, Mr Salmond urged voters not to ""jeopardise what we've built over 60 years"".
Asked if she had been taken aback by the strength of the Leave campaign in Wales, Ms Wood said: ""Yes, I have.""
""I've been quite surprised by how so many people have been able to be persuaded around this question of fear of immigration.
""We've got a week now to try to persuade as many people as possible that it is in Wales' best interests to Remain as a part of the European Union,"" she added.
Earlier, Ms Wood said politicians in Wales wanting the UK to stay in the EU had failed to organise a ""proper, decent campaign"".
She told BBC Radio Wales the assembly election in May had ""dominated all of us in Wales on the political scene"".
""The timing of this referendum was a bit of a disaster from a Welsh perspective,"" she said.
""It's been very difficult and challenging.""
Mr Grayling and his fellow Brexit vote campaigners gatherer around the Tommy Cooper statue in Caerphilly on Thursday, with drivers tooting their horns as they drove past.
""This is a battle between those who don't like the European Union and say we should definitely leave, and those who don't like the European Union but say 'oh well, we should stay',"" he said.
""I have to say there is little support for the EU anywhere in the United Kingdom.""
Mr Grayling added: ""I know how tough it is in parts of the valleys - I've been here many times before.
""I've seen some of the challenges in and around this area.
""I've spoken to some of the people who face the consequences of migration into this area.""
Mr Gill, UKIP Wales' leader, said that Leave had the momentum.
""There is something in the air. We've felt it for about the last two weeks now.""
He said: ""People are positive, they are expressing their views openly.""
Asked if the event felt like a victory rally, Mr Gill said: ""It almost did, didn't it?
""The reality is that until we see those numbers and we know that we've won we can't take if for granted.""",The leader of Plaid Cymru has said she has been taken aback by the strength of the campaign in Wales to leave the EU.
"Up to 15,000 riders are taking part in the Velothon Wales race through Cardiff, Newport, Torfaen, Monmouthshire and Caerphilly.
There had been criticism of road closures, with claims businesses could lose thousands of pounds in trade.
Velothon Wales' event director said the area had been quickly cleared.
Andy Taylor said: ""We can confirm that a small amount of tacks were discovered at around 9.30am on isolated sections of the route at Belmont Road in Caerleon and 10.02am at High Street/New Road in Caerphilly.""
Velothon rider Mark Tonkin, who travelled from Cornwall to take part in the race, said he witnessed a cyclist getting a punctured tyre from a tack.
""A guy punctured on a downhill piece and he could have taken out 50 riders. They could have been in hospital,"" he said.
Mr Tonkin said he could see why people might what to show they were ""upset"" about disruption the event caused.
""But to throw tacks down, to endanger people's lives, is not the way to do it,"" he added.
Cyclists and charity fundraisers from all over the UK and Europe are taking part in the event, which also includes a professional race.
Earlier, race organisers said road closures meant motorists could face disruption but affected routes would be reopened on a rolling basis to ensure minimum disruption.
Amateur riders are taking on either a 140km (87-mile) or 50km (31-mile) route, whilst the professionals tackle a 194km (120-mile) route taking in Caerphilly mountain and The Tumble mountain in Abergavenny.
On Thursday, Velothon organisers admitted confusion over who had been consulted about the route, after Monmouth MP David Davies accused them of lying.
But while some have criticised the planning of the event, others have said it will be good for the area, including Cardiff where it starts and ends.
Mari Williams, of pro-cycling group Cardiff Cycling City, said: ""It's great to see so much attention on cycling in Cardiff. We want Cardiff to be the best cycling city in the UK every day of the year.
""A city that's good for cycling is good for business. Cycling to work boosts productivity, improves staff retention and reduces travel costs.""",Cyclists taking part in a major race in south Wales were forced to carry their bikes for a time after a small amount of tacks were discovered on the route.
"Igors Zunda, 33, died when Jurijs Zunda collided with a lorry on the A43 in Northamptonshire in 2012.
Igors's son, who was two years old, was confined to a wheelchair as a result of the crash, the High Court heard.
The undisclosed settlement for Igors' widow Marina Kruglova, 30, is to be paid by the Motor Insurers' Bureau.
The bureau is the body which compensates victims of uninsured motorists.
The Mazda 5 car, which had four passengers, collided with a DAF lorry at Duddington near Corby on 4 December 2012.
Another passenger, Jevgenijs Draguns was also killed, while Julija Vonfelfende was injured.
Jurijs Zunda was jailed for 18 months in 2013 after pleading guilty to a charge of causing death by driving while unlicensed, disqualified or uninsured and he has since returned to Latvia.
The terms of the settlement were not revealed in court.
Interim compensation payments had already been paid to allow Ms Kruglova to adapt her home for her son, who is now five years old.
She was living in Lincoln, but is now in Glenfield, Leicester.

"Crashes similar to those suffered by Fernando Alonso in Australia on Sunday will be part of a risk assessment into the 'halo' device, planned for 2017.
The Spaniard's McLaren came to rest upside down after his 180mph crash at the season-opening race in Melbourne.
""We need to see if it could become more difficult to get out,"" he said.
Even if the halo made it more difficult for a driver to get out of his car in such a situation, that would not be enough to prevent its introduction.
The device is being investigated on a holistic basis and the FIA will weigh any potential extra problems with a driver's ability to remove himself from the cockpit against the increased safety.
But only if the cons outweighed the pros would head protection be delayed.
Alonso's team-mate Jenson Button said after the race that there was ""no need for him to get out in that situation"", adding: ""It's better to have a halo system. They [safety workers] would tip the car over of course to get him out, so it takes a bit longer. But he was OK so it doesn't matter.""
Governing body the FIA is aiming to make a final decision on the adoption of the halo by the end of May, following the completion of the risk assessment.
Its F1 director Charlie Whiting has told teams the device will be introduced if the process does not throw up any unanticipated risks and that he expects no opposition.
Even if a team did object, the FIA could force it through on safety grounds.
The FIA is still waiting for all the data to be recovered from the accident data recorders on Alonso's car before investigating exactly what happened.
The 34-year-old double world champion sustained a peak force of 46G during the crash, which he described as the biggest of his career.
It was triggered when Alonso's right front wheel caught the left-rear wheel of Esteban Gutierrez's Haas as he was trying to overtake on the approach to Turn Three.
All cars are fitted with a high-speed camera pointing back towards the driver's head to analyse its trajectory during an accident.
The device works at 400 frames per second - 16 times faster than a normal camera - and it will reveal whether there would have been any danger to the driver's head had a halo been fitted.
This is considered highly unlikely, as the halo has been designed to be well out of reach of the helmet even in extreme scenarios.
These cameras, along with in-ear accelerometers worn by the drivers and data from sensors on the chassis, mean the FIA can build up a detailed picture of the events of an accident.
Alonso, who is one of the vast majority of drivers backing the introduction of extra head protection, said it was important to look into what would have happened in his accident and its aftermath had a halo been fitted.
The risk assessment into the halo will focus on the potential negatives of the device, and whether they are worse than what would have happened to the driver if it had not been fitted.
If the positives outweigh the negatives more often than not, that will be considered a satisfactory situation for the introduction of the halo.
Driver egress is only one of about nine different potential dangers that are part of the assessment.
The halo, which was tested by Ferrari during the final pre-season test in Spain, is not the only head-protection system under consideration.
Red Bull has proposed an alternative solution, which has a similar elliptical loop above the driver's head but differs from the halo in having two side supports rather than one at the front and a screen around it.
But Whiting says that is ""considerably further behind in development, it's never been tested, but it could offer additional protection"".
The device may be ready for the FIA to test its efficacy in protecting against a flying wheel by the end of April.
The test fires a 20kg wheel and upright assembly at the car at 225km/h. The device has to deflect it without breaking.
The screen is one of the biggest potential problems with the Red Bull device - it is unclear whether this would cause visibility problems as a result of collecting debris or in wet weather.",The ease with which drivers can get out of an upturned car will be investigated before finalising the introduction of head protection next year.
"A 35-year-old woman had to be cut out of a pair after her calves ballooned in size, the medics said in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry.
She had spent hours squatting to empty cupboards for a house move in Australia. By evening, her feet were numb and she found it hard to walk.
Doctors believe the woman developed a condition called compartment syndrome, made worse by her skinny jeans.
Other hidden health risks in your wardrobe
Who, What, Why: Are skinny jeans bad for your health?
Compartment syndrome is a painful and potentially serious condition caused by bleeding or swelling within an enclosed bundle of muscles - in this case, the calves.
The condition caused the woman to trip and fall and, unable to get up, she then spent several hours lying on the ground.
On examination at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, her lower legs were severely swollen.
Although her feet were warm and had enough blood supplying them, her muscles were weak and she had lost some feeling.
As the pressure had built in her lower legs, her muscles and nerves became damaged.
She was put on an intravenous drip and after four days was able to walk unaided.
Other medics have reported a number of cases where patients have developed tingly, numb thighs from wearing the figure-hugging low-cut denim trousers - although the chance of it happening is still slim for most people.
Priya Dasoju, professional adviser at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said: ""As with many of these warnings, the very unfortunate case highlighted is an extreme one.
""There's no need to ditch the skinny jeans just yet, simply avoid staying in the same position for too long and keep moving throughout the day. If you do suffer any prolonged pain you should of course seek help, but no-one should be alarmed by this warning or change the cut of their jeans.""","Skinny jeans can seriously damage muscles and nerves, doctors have said."
"City supporters' organisation the 1894 Group, which has criticised the club's ticket prices, said it was a ""step in the right direction"".
But, in a statement, the group added: ""It's vital we keep the pressure on the club and use our collective voices.""
Swansea are also among the Premier League teams to cap their prices.
West Ham, meanwhile, will lower season-ticket prices for their move to the Olympic Stadium for 2016-17.
Liverpool cancelled plans to introduce a £77 ticket next season after thousands of fans walked out of Anfield after 77 minutes of their game with Sunderland in February.
In March, all Premier League clubs agreed to cap the price of tickets for away supporters at £30.","Manchester City will freeze season-ticket prices next season, matching the commitment made by Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea."
"The reforms - which would significantly increase the powers of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan - received the required three-fifth majority in the assembly.
The bill will be put to a referendum, probably in April, and will become law if more than 50% of voters back it.
Critics say the move could usher in authoritarian rule, and amounts to a power grab by Mr Erdogan.
But the president says the changed system will resemble those in France and the US.
The constitutional reform bill was approved by 339 of the 550-member assembly.
Who is Turkey's dominant president?
No cause for optimism in divided Turkey
Turkey targets 10,000 social media users
Mr Erdogan assumed the presidency, a largely ceremonial position, in 2014 after over a decade as Turkey's prime minister.
The reforms would let the president retain ties to a political party, so Mr Erdogan could resume leadership of the AK Party (AKP), which he co-founded.
Opposition leaders say that would abolish any chance of presidential impartiality.
It has been suggested that Mr Erdogan could remain in power until 2029 under the new rules.
The draft constitution states that the next presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on November 3, 2019.
The president would have a five-year tenure, for a maximum of two terms.
If the clock on Mr Erdogan's presidency re-sets from 2019, that would allow him to stay in the job until 2029, not 2024.
Mr Erdogan has not made clear whether this would be the case.
Turkey's Prime Minister Binali Yildirim congratulated MPs on passing the constitutional changes, saying: ""We have done our job. Now we convey the issue to its real owner, our people.""
Kemal Kilicdaroglu, the leader of the opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), urged Turks to ""spoil the game that was played in parliament"".
He described the approval of the presidential system as a ""mistake"".
Debates over the constitution changes have been heated.
Last week a fight broke out in parliament after the AKP clashed with CHP members when an MP tried to film a voting session during a debate.
The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) boycotted the vote.
To secure its necessary majority, the AKP has relied on the support of the rightwing Nationalist Movement Party, the fourth-largest in the legislature.

"The popular Smart Sheriff app has vulnerabilities that could leak children's personal details or allow the phone to be hacked, the study says.
The app's developer says it has since addressed some of the issues raised in the report, although this has not been independently verified.
South Korea mandated in April that all children's phones must be monitored.
Anyone under 19 who buys a smartphone must install an app that can filter and block harmful content.
The University of Toronto report is based on two separate security audits, one conducted by researchers at the Citizen Lab with the university's Munk School of Global Affairs, and the other by auditing firm Cure53.
Smart Sheriff was developed by a consortium of telecommunications companies known as the Korean Mobile Internet Business Association (Moiba). It has been downloaded by hundreds of thousands of users in South Korea.
The app allows parents to control the apps on their child's mobile phone, as well as schedule when the phone can be used. It can also alert parents when it detects trigger words such as ""kill"", ""rape"", and ""suicide"", according to earlier news reports.
However, the new report found that children's personal details and browsing activity were not secure on the app, parental limits could be easily disabled and Smart Sheriff's design and infrastructure were insufficiently protected.
The report said this could ""allow children to bypass parental protections, allow malicious attackers to disrupt access to every user's device, and interfere with the operations of the service"".
""This case shows precisely how good intentions can end up seriously wrong â€” in this case, a government-promoted parental monitoring application actually putting children at greater, rather than less, risk of harm,"" said Citizen Lab's director Ron Deibert.
News agency AP quoted independent researcher Collin Anderson, who worked with Citizen Lab on the report, as saying: ""Smart Sheriff is the kind of baby sitter that leaves the doors unlocked and throws a party where everyone is invited.""
Citizen Lab said it had informed Moiba of the vulnerabilities. Moiba has since released updates, the latest on 25 August, to fix the issues raised. However, researchers said they had yet to independently verify if all vulnerabilities had been addressed.
The BBC's calls to Moiba on Monday were not answered.
The introduction of the child monitoring law in April sparked some controversy, with critics raising privacy concerns.","A child monitoring phone app funded by the South Korean government has major security flaws, a new report says."

"Marco Pierre White Jr, 21, had pleaded guilty to dishonestly making a false representation on 23 November.
He was told he had to undertake 120 hours of unpaid work and pay £2,500 in compensation to his victim.

"Jetstar and Virgin cancelled all their flights between Australia and Bali's Denpasar airport, hitting the school holiday season.
It is the second day of flight disruptions due to continued eruptions from Mount Raung. Some of those affected by the Bali closure have been speaking to the BBC about their situation:
Erika Fitzgerald, who was on holiday in Bali, said she was due to start a new job near Sydney on Monday but will not make it back in time.
""My main concern at the moment is getting back for that,"" she said. Instead of flying direct, she is now trying to get on a flight to Singapore on Saturday then three connecting flight back to Sydney.
""If we hadn't taken the four flight option we wouldn't have been able to get back till Sunday 19 [July],"" she said.
Janan Jedrzejewski said she had booked a Bali villa with a private pool as part of a post-breakup retreat.
""I wanted to go get my nails done and get mud baths and go back looking fabulous,"" she said.
But when she arrived at the airport on Thursday night Jetstar staff told her the flight had been cancelled.
""I used to work for the airlines so take in my stride, [it's] better safe than sorry, but I'm trying to cancel my villa,"" Ms Jedrzejewski told the BBC.
Jake Powell said he managed to get back to Australia but his parents are stuck in Bali for another 10 days and may not be able to make a claim for the delay through their travel insurance.
""[Mum] was supposed to fly back tonight to Sydney and catch a connecting flight to Newcastle so I could pick her and Dad up tomorrow at 1pm,"" Jake told the BBC.
Wendy Robertson, 78, was hoping to return from Bali feeling relaxed, but has instead been stuck with little information about when she and her eight-year-old grand-daughter, Ashley, will get home.
""I have run out of my medications for blood pressure and diabetes,"" she told Fairfax. ""I have to take them every day, I only brought a supply for six days.
""I am in a hiatus. There is no information. All I got was a recorded message. I was told I can arrange to confirm my booking online but I am 78-years-old. I [can't] access online.""
How long will this go on?
Forecasters say the situation is somewhat unpredictable as it is a matter of waiting for Mount Raung to stop erupting.
""This volcano has been erupting for about a week and it's been streaming ash constantly,"" Chris Davies from Darwin's Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre told the BBC.
""It's not an explosive eruption, just a constant stream and because the summit is so high it doesn't take much ash to interfere with flights.
""The most dangerous aspect for aviation is that modern jet engines pull in so much air and the ash concentrates in engines and turns into a kind of molten glass.
""The ash melts, coats inside of the engine and affects fuel flow, so in the worst case scenario it can cause engines to shut off.""
Along with Denpasar airport, Lombok's international airport, Selaparang Airport also in Lombok, Blimbingsari Airport in Banyuwangi, East Java and Notohadinegoro Airport in Jember, East Java are also closed.",Travellers to and from Australia have been left stranded or unable to go on holiday after an erupting volcano forced Indonesia to close five airports on Friday.
"Scott Coleman, 41, from Liverpool, was caught in 2003 but was freed on bail and failed to reappear.
He was finally detained in Amsterdam earlier this year before being extradited.
Coleman admitted being concerned in the supply of heroin and was jailed for five years.
Lord Glennie jailed him for four years for his involvement in the heroin supply and a further year for failing to appear.
The judge told him at the High Court in Edinburgh: ""The court cannot turn a blind eye to this flaunting of its authority.""
Coleman is also wanted by the Spanish authorities after he was sentenced in his absence to more than six years imprisonment for a drugs offence there.
Defence solicitor advocate Ewen Roy said Coleman made ""a series of dreadful decisions"" some time ago.
He said that before he became involved in bringing drugs to Scotland he had no involvement in crime, but was under financial pressure at the time.
Coleman acted as a courier in the supply of drugs from Merseyside to the north east of Scotland.
A major police operation targeting the large scale illegal trade resulted in the jailing of brothers Derek and Jason McAllister for 12 and 10 years in 2006.","A man who went on the run for more than a decade has been jailed for trafficking heroin worth more than £200,000 into Aberdeen."
"The average fee for a fixed-rate mortgage is now more than £1,000 - the most expensive for four years, according to Moneyfacts.
The financial information service said that borrowers and lenders tended to focus on mortgage interest rates.
Rates are now among the lowest ever seen in the UK mortgage market.
However, Moneyfacts said that some borrowers would be better off by choosing a slightly higher rate with a lower fee, or no fee, when they remortgaged.
""Those savvy borrowers heeding the advice to remortgage could find that moving deals can be a costly affair, especially if their preference is for shorter-term fixed rates. Therefore, with fees on the rise, it is more important than ever for borrowers to consider the true cost of a mortgage before obtaining a deal,"" said Charlotte Nelson, of Moneyfacts.
""Deals with larger fees often allow you to add the fee to the mortgage advance, however, this increases the amount borrowed, pushing up monthly repayments.
""The extra saved by opting for a deal with no fee could be better used to overpay the mortgage, which could help borrowers become mortgage-free quicker.""
Figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) show that, on a seasonally-adjusted basis, property transactions have generally been close to the 100,000 mark each month for the past three years.
This climate, in part, has resulted in lenders launching new products to try to attract new borrowers, often with very low rates.
Moneyfacts said that, for those with a £150,000 mortgage and repaying over 25 years, some deals with the lowest rates on the market have fees of around £2,000, with one as high as £4,000.
The average fee for these customers was now £1,018, compared with £986 a year ago, and £886 in July 2014.","Homeowners are making a ""costly mistake"" by turning a blind eye to additional fees when they remortgage, it has been claimed."
"The Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone was elected in 2015 with DUP support.
MPs backed a request from the prime minister to hold a snap general election on 8 June by 522 votes to 13.
Sinn Féin's northern leader said Mrs May had shown a ""blatant disregard for the people of the north"".
Michelle O'Neill said the prime minister's announcement of a general election was about ""the Tory party's self interest"".
Meanwhile, the SDLP rejected any suggestion of her party entering a pact with Sinn Féin.
DUP MP Ian Paisley said the ""deep frost button"" had been pressed on power-sharing talks in Northern Ireland.
Mr Paisley expressed concerns about the future of the talks process during the general election campaign.
""We are seeing the freezer bags come out and the deep frost button being pressed on the Assembly,"" he said.
In the last general election, in May 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agreed pacts in four constituencies, including the UK's most tightly-contested seat of Fermanagh and South Tyrone.
That pact helped Mr Elliott take the seat from Sinn Féin's Michelle Gildernew - she had held on to it by just four votes in 2010.
On Tuesday, UUP leader Robin Swann said he was ""open"" to discussion on the issue of pacts.
Mr Elliott told the BBC on Wednesday it was important that the ""people of Northern Ireland have representation at Westminster"".
He also said talks with the DUP would take place in the days ahead to secure the ""best agreement around some constituencies"".
Earlier, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party wanted to ""quickly"" arrange talks with the UUP on a potential pact.
Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that the DUP was ""prepared to go further"" this time.
""We recognise that - if Northern Ireland is to maximise its representation and to have a strong voice in the absence of our own government - then we need to return MPs who will actually take their seats at Westminster,"" he said.
Sinn Féin currently has four MPs but they do not take their seats in the House of Commons, in protest at British rule in Northern Ireland.
Sir Jeffrey suggested there should be a new unionist pact in Fermanagh and South Tyrone and ""other constituencies as well"".
The DUP MP highlighted South Belfast as one constituency where the unionists could gain a seat from nationalists by agreeing to stand a single-unity candidate.
The  seat is currently held by SDLP MP Dr Alasdair McDonnell.
However, there will be no reciprocal deal between nationalist parties, according to Dr McDonnell's colleague, South Down MP Margaret Ritchie.
Mrs Ritchie told Good Morning Ulster: ""We don't do electoral pacts"".
""The SDLP fights the election - each and every election - on our own mandate and our own basis,"" she said.
Speaking on the same programme, Sinn Féin's national chairperson, Declan Kearney, said his party shared much ""common ground"" with the SDLP, Alliance and the Green Party on issues such as Brexit, equality and the legacy of the Troubles.
He said parties opposed to a hard Brexit and austerity policies should work together.
""We'll do our best to maximise the Sinn Féin vote,"" Mr Kearney said.
UUP MP Danny Kinahan criticised Sinn Féin abstentionism.
""At the moment, there are four seats where no-one turns up at Westminster and it is the mother of all parliaments,"" he said.
The UUP MP admitted that he was ""likely to have a battle with the DUP"" to hold on to his South Antrim seat.
He appeared to support a pre-election deal for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and potentially other seats.","The Ulster Unionist Party is to have talks with the Democratic Unionists about an electoral pact in the ""next few days"", Tom Elliott has said."
"Traditionally a place for studios to show off what they have been working on, this year the gaming industry extravaganza has shaped up a little differently.
Publisher EA has decided to run a separate event aimed at gamers, while rival Activision is letting the console companies promote its games, rather than having its own showcase.
""Usually it has been a retail show connecting publishers with buyers, but that is less relevant now due to the digital opportunities in gaming,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, director of games at consultancy IHS Technology.
""But E3 still has an important role to play. It's where people learn about new products coming to market.""
And plenty of studios have capitalised on the excitement around E3 to tease their new releases, many squeezing out announcements before doors open on 14 June.
Of course, if previous years are anything to go by, there are likely to be a few surprises during the week.
Harvey Smith has worked on critically acclaimed games including cyberpunk role-playing adventure Deus Ex, and stealth-action thriller Dishonored, which won the Bafta award for best game in 2013.
The BBC asked him to share the games he's most looking forward to at E3.
Overland
I'm a big fan of Adam Saltsman. His game Capsule - an incredibly tense and claustrophobic space travel game - is sublime. Overland is a thoughtful, soulful, post-apocalyptic road trip game with a beautifully laconic art style. Every year, there's an indie game or two that just feels like it was made for me. This year, it might be Overland.
Luna
I really like Robin Hunicke's work and the art style is super cute - but it goes beyond that. I love that you're not really sure what kind of game it will be. It's the combination of looking sweet and naive on the surface, but somehow hinting at something more complex and sophisticated. I suspect it's a bit of a Trojan horse in that respect.
No Man's Sky
We play games for a variety of reasons. Some people play games to demonstrate mastery over systems; some play to marvel at a reality beyond ours; some play to feel a sense of wonder at the ecological grandeur of the world. No Man's Sky promises all of that, seducing us with unknown possibilities.
Deus Ex: Mankind Divided
As one of the people to have participated in the genesis of the Deus Ex brand of dystopia, I am full of hope for the new Deus Ex game. If it's all I want it to be, it will present players with a gritty world gone wrong, challenging moral terrain, and flexible game systems that lead to improvisational ""play"" in the true sense of the word.
State of Decay 2 (Rumoured)
As a fan of often nihilistic zombie fiction, I was really drawn to State of Decay. The original was a gem in the rough. The best thing about the game was the way it kept enabling player-driven stories. So many times, I got into a tight spot of my own making, then managed to get out of it through creative play. Some moments left me sweating and yelling when I got back to home base, and those moments were generally unscripted. If the new game is more polished, this could be really strong.
Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rumoured)
I grew up watching spaghetti westerns. They're problematic, but they occupy a mythic place in my soul. I loved Red Dead Redemption for its pacing and exploration value - watching a good western is cool, but inhabiting one is another thing entirely. I still miss my beautiful horse, killed by a pair of mountain lions, both of which I shot dead and skinned. I hope the developers took note of the stories players told after engaging with the game.
Three short years have passed since the PlayStation 4 (PS4) and Xbox One went on sale, but there is an expectation that both consoles will soon be refreshed.
In the past, Microsoft and Sony refined their consoles during their lifecycles with cosmetic changes and occasionally some useful upgrades such as a larger hard drive.
But this time round more significant changes are planned.
Sony revealed to the Financial Times on Friday that it is working on an upgraded PS4 codenamed Neo. It said it would be able to handle 4K output - four times the detail of 1080p high definition - but would not be ready to unveil at E3.
Sony added it would be more expensive than the basic version, which will continue to be made, but did not say by how much.
""I do not believe the new PS4 will be possible of native 4K gaming,"" commented Mr Harding-Rolls.
""The cost implications on both the device and content creation make this unfeasible.
""It is likely to support 4K video - as this is where the majority of 4K content is emerging - and will probably upscale PS4 games to 4K output.
""Whether this upscaling significantly improves the visuals probably depends on the game, the size of the 4K TV it is shown on and the quality of upscaling.""
Gaming blogs have also suggested that a smaller Xbox One could be unveiled at E3.
The console has been criticised for being bulkier than its predecessor, although Microsoft designer Carl Ledbetter has explained the size helps keep the machine cool and allows it to run quietly.
Nintendo has already confirmed it is working on a new console - codenamed NX - but has said it will not be showing  the device at E3.
Virtual reality was expected to steal the show at last year's E3, but despite high-profile backing from the likes of Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, gamers with VR headsets are still few and far between.
Headsets such as the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are finally making their way onto gamers' faces, so 2016 could be the year that blockbuster titles that attract the masses are announced.
Sony's PlayStation VR is due out in October - perhaps perfectly timed for the highly anticipated space exploration game No Man's Sky to be revealed as a launch title.
Creator Sean Murray has said it would be a ""perfect fit"" for VR, and it has been tested in Oculus - but he has yet to reveal more.
Microsoft currently has no VR hardware of its own, instead focusing on its Hololens augmented reality helmet, which superimposes graphics over real-world views.
But the Xbox controller already works with the Oculus Rift headset, and there is speculation that Microsoft will announce a tie-up with the Oculus platform.
""Microsoft has been looking at an open approach to VR, inviting manufacturers to use its Windows platform to build their businesses on,"" said Mr Harding-Rolls.
""I think it would be a stretch to go from those ideas, to announcing an exclusive agreement to bring a particular VR headset manufacturer to Xbox One.
""But it has to put forward strategies to convince Xbox 360 users who haven't converted yet to upgrade.""
The PS4 has pulled ahead of Xbox One in the console race, so gamers will be watching Microsoft closely for exclusives. Gaming blogs have suggested two series featuring the undead will be revived.
""We're expecting Dead Rising 4, and State of Decay 2 - both have performed well on the Xbox platform before,"" said Tom Phillips, deputy news editor at Eurogamer.
Some of last year's biggest announcements - such as first-person shooter Gears of War 4, and role-playing game Scalebound - have yet to be released.
Sony too has yet to deliver on some of its previous announcements, such as The Last Guardian, a fantasy-adventure about a boy who befriends a cat-bird hybrid creature. It was first announced at E3 in 2009.
""The Last Guardian has achieved an almost mythical quality by this point,"" said Mr Phillips.
""It's finally coming out this year, so hopefully it's the last time we'll see it trailed at E3. But it does feel like when these big games do come out, they are generally well received, as with Uncharted.
""This year, I think we'll see Sony hand over the stage to some of the games it has tie-ins with, such as Call of Duty.""
The military-inspired shooter began as a Windows game in 2003, but now offers some add-on content to PlayStation gamers first.
It's shaping up to be a relatively quiet E3 for Nintendo, but it is likely to attract attention with its much-delayed Legend of Zelda game, with a new quest for the young sword-wielding hero Link.
It is one of the bestselling series of all time, but the latest instalment has been repeatedly delayed. First announced in 2014, is now tipped to be a launch title for the NX console, and could end up being the last big home-grown game Nintendo releases for the Wii U.
Not everything promised at E3 is successfully delivered.
Ubisoft was criticised after its 2012 demo of Watch Dogs featured superior graphics to those that appeared in the released console games.  A San Francisco-set sequel has been teased ahead of E3.
""First time round there was huge interest in the game, but it didn't quite live up to expectations,"" said Mr Phillips.
""Ubisoft has a history of having a good idea but not quite getting it right until the second release, as with Assassin's Creed.
""Hopefully with this sequel they have had time to refine it.""

"Rio the red kite was found near Leitrim, County Down, with an infection in her foot.
It meant the bird could not flex her talons, which affected her ability to feed.
She became weak and unable to fly.
She was reintroduced to the wild after being treated by a vet.
Rio was one of 80 red kites introduced to Northern Ireland and has raised five chicks.
She is important to the programme because she has bred consistently since her release.
The red kite has been under pressure in south Down since its reintroduction in the years between 2008 and 2010.
Three birds have been shot, a further 12 have been poisoned and 12 more have been found dead with no clear cause.
There are just 12 breeding pairs, well short of the 50 pairs experts say are required for a sustainable population.
Claire Barnett is a senior conservation officer with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB).
She said they have tried hard to get the message across that the birds do not pose a threat to livestock - especially lambs.
""The bird actually has small, weak feet so there's no way they're going to be able to pick up anything bigger than a small rabbit.
""Their main diet is made up is things like mice and worms and rats and road kill,"" Ms Barnett said.
There is some good news though - the breeding pairs have produced 71 chicks and RSPB staff said there is evidence that the birds have begun to spread out.
They are asking the public to send them details of any sightings.

"Det Sgt Craig Warren told a jury at the High Court in Glasgow he was sent to the Glasgow home of Scottish Sun journalist Russell Findlay.
He saw a jar on the floor of the hallway and splash marks on a dado rail and wall mirror.
William Burns, 56, and Alexander Porter, 48, deny throwing acid in the face of Mr Findlay on 23 December 2015.
They also deny a charge of attempted murder in connection with the shooting of a man near an East Dunbartonshire primary school.
Det Sgt Warren said he arrived at Mr Findlay's home about an hour after the alleged attack.
One of the accused, William Burns, had already been detained and taken away from the scene.
The substance he found in the hallway, he told the court, was found to be sulphuric acid.
He also described items he found in the driveway of Mr Findlay's home.
They were ""what appeared to be two layers of false teeth, a beanie hat, a snood and a knife"".
The knife was found near the threshold of the front door.
Mr Warren said that his focus then turned to how Mr Burns might have got to the scene, and how he might have got away.
He confirmed to the Advocate Depute Richard Goddard that officers searched CCTV footage from the day of the alleged attack, and also preceding days, to try to establish if the accused had carried out a reconnaissance of the area.
Footage from cameras in Crow Rd, and next to Jordanhill school on Chamberlain Rd was shown to the jury.
On three separate dates, Mr Warren said a Volvo was seen near Mr Findlay's home - including driving away from the crime scene on the day of the alleged attack, two minutes after Mr Burns had been detained.
The detective described it in court as ""yellow or gold"".
The jury had already heard that Alexander Porter had a gold-coloured Volvo S40 in 2015.
On the 28th January Police Scotland executed a search warrant at the home of Alexander Porter, and detained him. During subsequent questioning, the accused replied ""no comment"" to all questions put to him.
Under cross-examination by Susan Duff, defence counsel for Mr Porter, Mr Warren said that 16.5 hours of CCTV footage was examined. But neither the registration number or actual colour of the Volvo was identifiable, nor was the number of occupants in the car.
Susan Duff also queried the officer's assertion that he knew the Jordanhill area of the city well, pointing out he had called Woodend Drive ""Woodend Road"".
During the search of Mr Porter's flat, Mr Warren said 16 items were retrieved from kitchen drawers - none of which was a knife.

"The painting, which had been on loan at The National Gallery for 30 years, was at risk of being sold abroad.
""It's one of the quintessential images of 19th century British art and it's worth every penny,"" Tate Britain's Director Nicholas Serota told the BBC.
The work will be shown at Tate Britain until the end of the year before travelling around the UK.

Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows was acquired for £23.1m, but could have sold for as much as £40m at auction.
By Will GompertzArts editor
£23.1m might be a record for a Constable but it's worth every penny: a bargain compared to what's being paid for some second rate modern art.
It is arguably the most accomplished work by one of the finest, most exciting painters of the Romantic period.
Painted shortly after his wife's death, the ""iconic"" image was secured through major grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Art Fund, The Manton Foundation and Tate Members.
Sold by the children of the late Lord Ashton of Hyde, the work was at risk of going abroad had the Tate not been able to put the money together.
""I know there was a major American museum that asked for first refusal,"" said Sir Nicholas.
The acquisition was part of a partnership between five national and regional galleries:  Amgueddfa Cymru - National Museum Wales; the National Galleries of Scotland; Colchester and Ipswich Museums; Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum; and Tate Britain.
The partnership will enable the work to go on ""almost constant"" view across the UK.
Jenny Abramsky, from the Heritage Lottery Fund, said they were ""proud"" to be a major funder of the masterpiece with a £15m investment.
""It is unimaginable that this particular painting might have ended up anywhere other than in a UK public collection,"" she said.
Constable's The Lock became one of the most expensive British paintings ever sold when it fetched £22.4m at auction in July 2012.
Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows is one of a series of monumental six-foot canvases painted by the artist, a scale he reserved for his finest compositions.",John Constable's 1831 masterpiece Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows has been bought by the Tate for £23.1m.
"Until now, customers could find themselves locked in once the first three months of a deal had passed, unless they paid a penalty fee.
Under new rules, they will be able to walk away at any point, if certain conditions are met.
Ofcom's new chief Sharon White will outline details of the move.
In her first speech since taking the post, Ms White will say people still find it too difficult to cancel contracts and are often frustrated with customer service.
""When Ofcom was established, access to a reliable internet connection and mobile phone was a 'nice to have',"" she will tell a conference hosted by the consumers association Which.
""Now it is essential to the functioning of the economy, to the way people work and live their lives.""
Which's executive director welcomed the move.
""Unreliable broadband speeds drive consumers crazy, so we also welcome the regulator telling providers to give better information on the speeds customers will realistically achieve, and to let people leave their contracts without penalty if they don't get what is promised,"" said Richard Lloyd.
""This is an encouraging start by Sharon White at a time when there are very big challenges facing Ofcom.""
The new rules apply to internet service providers (ISPs) using digital subscriber line (DSL) technology.
That means BT, EE, Sky and TalkTalk are all affected, but not Virgin Media, which uses a cable-based system.
When a customer signs up to a deal, an ISP must give a range of speeds a customer can expect - for instance 20 to 40 megabits per second.
However, there is an additional measurement the companies refer to less often: the minimum guaranteed access line speed (MGALS).
This represents the fastest download speed delivered to the slowest 10% of customers on a similar service.
For example, there might be 10,000 homes based 4km (2.5 miles) away from the local telephone exchange.
If the fastest speed achieved by any of those in the 1,000 slowest properties was 7Mbps, that would represent the MGALS.
Until now, users could abandon their broadband contract without penalty within 90 days of its start if their home fell below the MGALS.
Under the revised code of practice, they can do so at any time, so long as they have given the provider a ""reasonable"" opportunity to fix the problem - for example a few weeks of time and access to their building.
The challenge for the public will be to determine if indeed their property falls below the cut-off point.
One expert said the move should benefit a ""small percentage"" of users, but said he still had concerns.
""The problem for the consumer is understanding whether switching provider will fix the problem,"" said Andrew Ferguson from the ThinkBroadband news site.
""If you switch and the new provider is using the same technology as the previous one, and the slow speeds are due to the line, then you may just carry on having the same issue.""
Ofcom can fine companies if they break the rules, but suggested individuals initially direct their complaints to including the Communications and Internet Services Adjudication Scheme (CISAS) or the Ombudsman Services.
""We have set the bar high for ourselves but also for industry,"" Ms White will say.
""If we deliver then everyone benefits: consumers and citizens of the country and the businesses who deliver the services we regulate.""",The broadband industry's watchdog has announced new rules to help subscribers quit their contracts if their speeds are too slow.
"There had been speculation the festival could be held elsewhere following remarks made earlier this year by founder Michael Eavis.
Eavis previously said he ""didn't really want to have a year without a festival"", and claimed the event could be held somewhere else in 2017 or 2018.
Tickets for next year's event go on sale in October, it has been confirmed.
In a statement on the Glastonbury Festival website, the organisers said: ""We will be taking our next fallow year in 2018, in order to give the farm, the village and the festival team the traditional year off.
""There are no plans to hold an event at another location in 2018.""
The music festival is held on the Eavis family's Worthy Farm in Somerset, south-west England, and traditionally takes a break every six years so as not to cause damage to the working fields.
The last fallow year was 2012.
In June, Eavis had told the BBC he was ""talking to Longleat"" as it was his ""favourite site"" for a new festival.
He had added that hosting it at Worthy Farm meant dealing with 22 different landowners, which ""wasn't easy"".
Next year's festival will take place from 21 to 25 June, with the first batch of tickets, for those buying coach packages, released on 6 October.
General tickets will be released three days later, at 09:00 BST on 9 October.

"The welfare cap was breached when the government was forced into a U-turn on cuts to tax credits last year.
Today, the rule on reducing debt has also been broken.
With the UK economy slowing, public sector net debt as a proportion of gross domestic product will rise this year, the Office for Budget Responsibility says.
That leaves the chancellor with one rule still extant - a budget surplus by 2020.
Matt Hancock, the Cabinet Office minister, insisted to the BBC that the rule will not be breached.
And Mr Osborne has staked his reputation on it.
To get there, the government is going to borrow a lot more over the next three years.
Around £38bn more according to the think tank, the Resolution Foundation.
And then plan for large tax cheques to arrive - largely from major businesses - by the next election.
The Budget Red Book says that in 2019-2020, business tax payments will increase rapidly.
Changing the timing of corporation tax payments will bring in nearly £6bn, the Treasury predicts.
Commercial stamp duty reform should bring in £560m and restricting corporation tax relief nearly £1bn.
The £3.5bn spending cuts to government departments will also kick in that year.
The Treasury argues that the changes, allied to lower debt interest payments, means the government can hit a surplus by 2020.
Watch those numbers closely and remember they are only forecasts.
The chancellor is staking an awful lot on them turning out correctly.","George Osborne set himself three fiscal rules - to cap welfare spending, to bring down debt as a proportion of national income and to produce a surplus by the end of the Parliament."

Westminster councillors voted 3-1 in favour of the bridge which will cost £3.5m in annual maintenance.
At a planning meeting concerns were raised about the potential loss of views, with heritage groups worried the sight of St Paul's Cathedral will be lost for some.
Civil engineers have also called it ""the most expensive footbridge in the world"".
Bridge consultant Simon Bourne told BBC London the cost is ""five to 10 times more than you'd expect a footbridge to be"".
He said that is because of its copper cladding.
By Tom EdwardsTransport correspondent, London
Campaigners feared the planning committees were just a formality as both Lambeth and tonight Westminster had nothing financially to lose with a garden bridge.
In a hot, packed room on the 17th floor there were shouts of ""shame"" and ""you're turning it into a theme park"" from some in the audience.  Supporters kept quiet.
And while both councils gave planning permission to the garden bridge, both committees have attached strings to the project. Westminster said Transport for London must act as guarantor on the £3.5m annual maintenance costs or the project won't get built.
Will TfL like that? Will the mayor tell them to underwrite maintenance or could there be another solution like a surety? The Garden Bridge Trust will be delighted at gaining permission. This is a big step for them but campaigners will already be plotting other ways to stop the bridge.
He said: ""One has to view this bridge to a certain extent not as a piece of infrastructure, but as a piece of art. It's not value for money and I don't think it's good design.""
But Lord Mervyn Davies, chairman of the Garden Bridge Trust, said: ""I think it's a reasonable cost for what is going to be an iconic bridge and I think the cladding is important because it needs to be visually beautiful.
""It needs to be able to stand the test of time.""
Robert Davis, deputy leader of Westminster Council, chaired the planning committee and said: ""This is something that is iconic and absolutely unique, and will be recognised right across the world.
""I understand the concerns about potential loss of views, but there is no doubting that this bridge will bring substantial and significant benefits to London.""
Transport for London has agreed to pay £30m in enabling costs to be matched by the Treasury.
The Garden Bridge Trust says it has raised about £120m which will go towards running costs as well.
As the bridge is a major infrastructure project, the Mayor of London will have the option to call it in for further scrutiny, or allow the bridge to go ahead as set out in the applications that were put before Lambeth and Westminster councils.",Plans to build a garden bridge across the River Thames are a step closer after Westminster City Council approved planning permission.

The majority of requests are for the removal of links to search results on Bing, although the firm also received requests for the removal of content from other Microsoft services, including OneDrive, Bing Ads and MSN.

""This new report illustrates how Microsoft strives to comply with local and intellectual property laws while adhering to our commitment to transparency and free expression,"" the firm said in a blog post.
At the time, search engines worried that the ruling would mean they would be inundated with requests while internet rights campaigners raised concerns that the ruling amounted to censorship.

"Some business leaders and politicians claimed the nuclear plant, just outside Bridgwater in Somerset, will lead to an economic boom for the area.
Initial estimates from Somerset County Council claimed the regional economy is set to benefit by around Â£4bn.
However, others are concerned about the impact of having Europe's largest construction site on their doorstep.
Leader of Somerset County Council John Osman said the decision is a ""once in a generation"" opportunity and will ""bring unprecedented investment and job creation to the county and the wider region"".

"What would ""out"" look like?
For those who back Britain remaining in the EU, the answer is pretty bleak.
If the UK wanted to trade with Europe, the country would still have to be bound by the rules of the EU which would be set - if Britain left - with little regard to this country's opinion.
We would not, those pro-the-EU argue, have a seat at the decision-making table.
In fact, we would be particularly weak because the remaining EU member states might very well want to teach Britain ""a lesson"" that being out of the union is not a free hit.
The chief executive of JCB, Graeme Macdonald, does not agree.
In an interview in The Guardian this morning he says that the UK is far too important a trading nation to be simply pushed to one side.
As an example, he points out that Britain is Germany's fourth largest market for car exports.
Mr Macdonald also argues that being in the EU is not some form of free trade panacea.
""It's easier selling to North America than to Europe sometimes,"" he says.
The chairman of JCB is Lord Bamford, the Conservative peer and major donor to the party.
In an interview with BBC Midlands, Lord Bamford says: ""We are the fifth or sixth largest economy in the world. We could exist on our own - peacefully and sensibly.""
This is a key part of the ""nothing to fear"" argument about the EU and I suspect it will be a strong theme for those who do not reject EU exit out of hand.
Interestingly, the ""nothing to fear"" formulation has been deployed in the past by two figures who will have considerable sway on the issue within government.
One is Sajid Javid, the new business secretary.
And the other is Jim O'Neill, the former chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, who was announced last week as the new commercial secretary to the Treasury, a job with a particular focus on developing economic growth outside London and the South East of England.
Mr O'Neill is also the man who coined the term ""Brics"" (Brazil, Russia, India and China) which he believes will form the powerhouses of the 21st Century global economy.
Here he is interviewed in The Telegraph in 2013: ""We should not be scared of it [leaving the EU] and exploring a world without it. The opportunities that are arising from the dramatically changing world are huge and I don't think quite a lot of people in our area [the City], never mind people in Brussels, are that interested or understand it,"" he said.
At lunch with the chief executive of a FTSE 30 company before Christmas, I asked whether he would rather Britain was in or out of the EU.
He argued that it was better that Britain stayed in.
But he also pointed out that if the UK did leave the EU, the company would still retain its headquarters in London.
Why? Because, he argued, the capital is the world leader in global finance and enjoys a regulatory and legal system that is not bettered elsewhere.
As well as a very convenient time zone for those companies that trade in the US and Asia.
Another FTSE 30 company chief executive I spoke to last week was of a similar opinion.
""We operate in over 100 different countries,"" he told me. ""Most of those are not in Europe.""
Post the election, the skeleton ""no fear leaving the EU"" argument is starting to form.
It is based on three premises  - Britain is a major trading nation; free trade agreements with fast growth economies will be easier outside the EU; and Britain can rid itself of unnecessary regulations which some believe hold back growth.
Of course, a significant number of businesses disagree, believing that being inside a reformed EU is the best future for the UK.
I was struck during a visit to Japan in 2012 how company leaders there were baffled at the thought that Britain would leave the largest trading union in the world.
What business actually ""thinks"" about Europe - and where the majority opinion lies - will be one of the defining issues ahead of the in/out referendum promised by David Cameron before the end of 2017.
Eleven days after the election and the arguments are already starting to coalesce.",A large part of the vitally important debate about Britain's future in or out of the European Union will be based around a simple question which raises a whole host of complicated answers.

Blur are also working on their first studio album as four-piece in 16 years, The Magic Whip.
Guitarist Graham Coxon said they started recording in Hong Kong when a gig was cancelled.
He said: ""we thought we'd put a few days, five or six days, to good use"".
The album is influenced by the band's time in Far East.
Damon Albarn confirmed one song was about time he spent in North Korea: ""it's my impression of the place, in a very abstract veiled way.
""When you listen to it is pretty self explanatory what it's about"".
The singer also said it was nice to work with a basic set-up when they first started to make the album to see what they could create.
He told the news conference that ""we didn't have much stuff so it was like recording when we first started doing stuff.  It was a really small studio, it was really hot and claustrophobic.
""We just went in there and knocked about some ideas.""
The album will be released on 27 April.

"Root, 25, made his Notts debut in 2016 and his breakthrough came this season when he made 107 from 93 balls against Warwickshire in the One-Day Cup.
Bowler Luke Fletcher has also signed a new two-year deal at Trent Bridge.
Fletcher, 28, was struck on the head while bowling at Edgbaston in July - an injury that ended his season.
Before the incident, he took 36 wickets at 22.44 to help Notts move clear at the top of County Championship Division Two.
""It's a well-deserved contract for Luke because of what he has done in the last 12 months,"" said Notts head coach Peter Moores.
""He's gone away and looked quite hard at what he can do to get himself into the team.
""We have seen the results of that in the way he bowled in the first part of the County Championship.""
Root came through the Yorkshire Academy before being released in 2011 and joining the MCC Young Cricketers.
He is now a regular in white-ball cricket for Notts and Moores wants him to push for a place in the four-day team.
""He's been an effective player for us, particularly in one-day cricket,"" Moores continued.
""We're looking for him to now push on in both white and red-ball cricket after working very hard for this opportunity.""","Billy Root, the younger brother of England captain Joe, has signed his first professional contract, agreeing a two-year deal with Nottinghamshire."
"Saturday's flight was the first movement of material held at the Caithness plant to the US since an announcement in February.
David Cameron, who was prime minister at the time, said the UK and US governments had agreed to an exchange of nuclear materials.
He said the UK would receive a type of uranium used to diagnose cancer.
But Highlands and Islands SNP MSP Maree Todd has criticised the weekend's flight and the level of secrecy surrounding the handling of nuclear material at Dounreay.
She said there should not be a need for an exchange of nuclear material, and the UK should be able to purchase what it requires for medical diagnoses.
Dounreay, near Thurso, is being decommissioned and the site cleaned up.
Most of the radioactive materials held there, such as fuel, are being moved to other locations, including Sellafield in Cumbria where it will be reprocessed or stored.
These shipments are being made by rail.
Other material has been returned to nuclear sites overseas.
During the 1990s, nuclear material was sent from abroad to Dounreay for reprocessing.
The customers included power plants and research centres in Australia, Germany and Belgium.
Under the UK-US deal signed earlier this year, highly-enriched uranium (HEU) stored at Dounreay is being sent to the US.
Saturday's flight took place under tight security from Wick John O'Groats Airport, which is about 30 miles (48km) from the Dounreay nuclear site.
It involved a US military Boeing C-17 transport aircraft.
Radioactive material from the civil nuclear industry has been transported by plane from the UK to other countries in the past.
The Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) provided Highlands and Islands Airports Limited with funding to upgrade Wick John O'Groats Airport in preparation for the US flights.
A spokesman for Dounreay said: ""All nuclear materials are being removed from the site. This programme started in 2001 and we expect it to continue for a number of years.
""Our priority at all times is to comply with regulations governing the safe and secure transportation of nuclear material, both in storage and transit.
""Compliance with these regulations includes protecting information about routes, dates, timings and locations of nuclear material in any current or future transport.""
MSP Ms Todd told BBC Radio Scotland: ""I am disappointed we are hearing reports from people living up in Wick that this has happened, but got no official notification.
""I understand that there has to be some secrecy surrounding this industry, but I feel there is more secrecy than is absolutely required.""
She added: ""I understand that this material is weapons-grade in exchange for some medical radionuclides.
""I fail to understand why we cannot pay money for these things than have to supply them with weapons-grade nuclear material from the UK.""",Radioactive material that was being kept at the Scottish nuclear power site Dounreay has been flown to the US.

It says the powder has been linked to two deaths in Northern Ireland during November and December 2016, and to three further three cases in December where the user was found unconscious.
The letter says some of those who have used it have been sold it as cocaine, while others may have believed it was heroin.

"But Alan Hunt does.
Every Friday and Saturday night, between 19:30 and 04:00, you will find the cheerful pensioner in a back office at Blandford Forum police station in north Dorset.
His ""job"" is to monitor footage from four CCTV cameras covering the centre of Blandford, a bustling market town notable for its distinctive Georgian buildings.
At closing time, with people making their way to and from Tiffany's, the town's only nightclub, Alan comes into his own, scrutinising a bank of TV screens for signs of trouble on the streets.
He is patched into the police radio system and alerts officers when they're needed on the ground.
""Somebody bit somebody's ear off,"" says the 73-year-old, recalling the worst thing he's seen in the five years he has been doing the role. ""There was a chap with a knife once,"" he adds.
The retired builder and road-sign maker is Dorset Police's most prolific volunteer.
The unpaid work he does for the force fulfils an ambition he has nursed since childhood.
He says: ""When I left school that was my original intention - to go into policing, as a student. But unfortunately we were not a very rich family so my mother said, 'You've got to stay at home and earn some money.'""
There are 400 other police volunteers in Dorset. Half work in staff roles, like Alan Hunt; half are special constables, with the full powers of police officers.
Martyn Underhill, the area's police and crime commissioner, wants to increase volunteer numbers and expand what they're able to do.
He says: ""I see it as a fantastic resource. As Robert Peel said, 'The public are the police, the police are the public' - this brings diversity, it brings additionality, it brings great scope to policing I believe in"".
The Home Office also wants to extend the role of police volunteers.
A consultation closed in October on plans to give them a wider range of powers and create the volunteer equivalent of Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs).
The proposals are expected to be included in the Policing and Criminal Justice Bill later this year.
Theresa May, the Home Secretary, writing in the consultation document, says unpaid police staff play a ""vital role in community safety"" but there is ""more that volunteers can do"".
Mrs May says she wants to encourage people to get involved in policing if they have ""skills in particular demand"" such as accountancy and IT, in order to help forces investigate cyber-crime and fraud.
I met Adam, 37, one of this new breed of police volunteers at the central London offices of the National Crime Agency (NCA).
He didn't want me to know his surname because of the sensitive nature of what he does.
His paid job is a security adviser for an insurance company that allows him to attend NCA meetings and carry out special projects - it builds up his experience, improves his CV and helps the NCA catch criminals.
""Because I've got quite a lot of experience in IT, I see things maybe somewhat different to how they would,"" says Adam, who had to be vetted before taking on NCA duties earlier this year.
He wouldn't take a paid job with the NCA because he can earn significantly more in the private sector - but the benefits for the NCA of being able to tap into such expertise for free are clear.
The organisation receives about 50 applications from volunteers each week, 10% of which are successful.
But at a time when the paid police workforce is shrinking, the recruitment of volunteers is a sensitive issue.
Unison, one of the trade unions that represents PCSOs and other police staff, is concerned the Home Office proposals are simply a cheap way of plugging gaps in the police service resulting from government cuts; 37,000 posts have been axed since 2010, and thousands more are projected to go over the next five years.
Ben Priestley, Unison's national officer for police and justice services, says a ""Home Guard"" of 9,000 volunteers has been ""quietly recruited"" to backfill roles that have been lost, raising concerns about competence and accountability.
""There's a general question about whether the general public believe that policing should be carried out by, in many cases, well-meaning amateurs,"" says Mr Priestley.
""Policing is a serious business, dealing with serious crime, and our members who work as police staff are fully trained, they're fully vetted and they're very, very committed to the job they do.
""If you're a volunteer, you're not under the direction and control of a chief constable, as police staff and police officers are, and that's a very real problem, and I don't think the general public would be happy about that.""
There are currently 16,000 volunteer police officers in England and Wales, known as special constables.
Specials undergo training, wear police uniform and have the same powers in law as their ""regular"" colleagues.
They tend to do mainstream policing, such as foot patrol, crowd control and crime prevention, rather than specialist work, and have to be available for at least 16 hours each month.
In addition, there are 9,000 volunteers performing a wide variety of different staff jobs in the police.
The union Unison, which surveyed police forces last year, says Kent has the largest number of volunteers (850), while volunteers in Thames Valley put in the most hours (70,000).
The survey identified more than 60 volunteer roles, ranging from mountain rescue to animal welfare, crime scene investigation to firearms licensing.
Unison says most of the 43 constabularies are planning to increase their use of volunteer police staff, including Nottinghamshire, which is aiming for a fivefold rise by the end of 2015.
At Dorset, Mr Underhill says a ""complete complaints system"" is in place for volunteers, though it's seldom needed.
He says the recruitment of volunteers is not driven by austerity - at least in his constabulary - but is a way of supplementing the work of paid staff.
That's certainly in evidence at Dorset Victims' Bureau, based at Bournemouth police station, where employees and volunteers work side by side, updating crime victims about their cases and giving them advice.
Whatever the objections, the financial realities of policing are such that this partnership between police and citizens will become even more of a feature of law enforcement in the years ahead.",Most people don't choose to spend their weekends at a police station.

"The area has been selected by the government to host the £5m Great Exhibition of the North in 2018.
It was chosen above three other shortlisted bidders - Sheffield, Bradford and Blackpool.
Former Chancellor George Osborne came up with the idea as part of his Northern Powerhouse package.
Culture Secretary Karen Bradley said she was won over by Newcastle and Gateshead's ""ambition"", including the organisers' estimate that the exhibition will attract three million people.
By Will Gompertz, arts editor
The only potential problem I can see at this stage with the Great Exhibition of the North is the title. It sets expectations high, don't you think? What with its echoes of The Great Exhibition (1851), which was a World Fair and therefore rather different.
There was also the famous Art Treasures of Great Britain exhibition, which was held in Manchester in 1857. That was a blockbuster show if ever there was one, with around 1.3 million visitors going to take a look at the 16,000 artworks on display. It ran for just over five months.
The team behind the Newcastle-Gateshead bid are hoping to attract three million people in two months to their multi-site showcase of the North of England's contemporary arts and enterprise scene.
That's an ambitious target. I hope it, together with the hyperbolic title, doesn't overwhelm the event's programmers and lead them down the Millennium Dome-type route of worthy but dull quasi-educational installations.
It should and could be a terrific show, leaving visitors to conclude for themselves that it was a great (with a lowercase G) exhibition.
""That level of ambition really did stand out,"" she told BBC News. ""But that doesn't mean this is just for Newcastle-Gateshead.""
The 77-day exhibition will have the overarching theme of The Blazing World - The Fires of Invention.
Newcastle and Gateshead's joint bid said: ""Inspired by the trailblazers of the north, the exhibition will have several cross-cutting themes for all to respond to, showing how the north's fires of invention continue to transform our world.
""Crucially, we will connect artists with scientists and inventors to work closely together, to create new artworks and respond to the great innovations of our time. Arts will meet industry in powerful and memorable ways.""
The region has already proved it can host major art events, with a record 140,000 people visiting the Turner Prize exhibition when it was staged at the Baltic in 2011.
But cultural venues in both Newcastle and Gateshead have struggled in the face of local council funding cuts in recent years.
As well as the £5m for the exhibition, the government has pledged £15m for a legacy fund, which will be open to cultural organisations across the north.
Mrs Bradley said: ""This is an exhibition for the whole north, and certainly through the legacy work, we are looking for bids across the whole of the north of England so we can really show everything the north has to offer.""

"Albanians Artur Doda, 24, and Leonard Isufaj, 27, leapt from the Stena Britannica, off Harwich, Essex, on 26 February last year.
The pair had tried to enter the UK hours earlier inside a lorry, the inquest into their deaths in Chelmsford heard.
Coroner Eleanor McGann recorded conclusions of accidental death.
Mr Doda and Mr Isufaj were among a group of 15 people from different countries caught in a random x-ray check at Harwich before making it into the UK.
The inquest heard Mr Doda was sliced by the ""machete-like"" motion of the ship's propeller while Mr Isufaj drowned.
Both men were sucked underwater almost immediately after they jumped over the side of the ship, ten minutes into its journey back to Zeebrugge, Belgium.
Essex coroner Ms McGann said: ""The evidence suggests they were intending to swim back to England, something that they could see was tantalisingly close to them.""
Insp Christopher Willis, from Essex Police, told the hearing the sea would have appeared deceptively calm to the men.
""To swim to land with those tides and the water temperature would have been nigh-on impossible,"" he said.
""An Olympic swimmer would have struggled.""
Speaking after the hearing, Mr Isufaj's cousin, Besnik Vata, 33, from north London, said the case highlighted the plight of many immigrants.
""We heard that they weren't escorted on board the ship so there was always a risk this would happen - if I was in that position I would have done the same,"" he said.

"Ecotricity wants to build 16 turbines on land near Duns in Berwickshire where there is an ""isolated landscape"" and ""high wind speeds"".
Councillors have also been asked to reject plans for an eight-turbine development at Larbrax Moor, near Leswalt in Wigtownshire.
However, planners have recommended they approve proposals for a nine-turbine wind farm near Glenluce.
Ecotricity will apply to the Scottish government for permission to build at Inch Moor, near Duns.
The firm said it wants to build turbines that measure 126.5m (415ft) in height.
It claims the project could meet the energy needs of about 36,500 homes.
Meanwhile, Dumfries and Galloway Council planners have recommended that Brookfield Renewable's plans for Larbrax Moor are refused.
They claim it would have a ""significant and adverse impact on the landscape"".
There are 10 wind farms either operational or under construction within a 30km (19 miles) area of the site.
Scottish Natural Heritage has also raised ""significant and serious concerns"" about the impact of the project on the landscape.
In papers submitted to the council, the developer claimed the project would generate 20MW of electricity over its 25-year lifespan.
The turbines would be 100m (328ft) high and they would stand on a 558 hectare (1,379 acres) site.
The application has drawn 59 letters of objection, including those from the South Rhins Community Development Trust and Wigtownshire Chamber of Commerce, and 134 in support.
Plans for the wind farm near Glenluce are expected to be approved by the same council.
Under plans submitted by WilloWind Gass, the turbines would fill a gap between the operational Artfield Fell wind farm and the Airies wind farm, which has been approved but not implemented.
Planners have recommended it is approved, subject to strict conditions.",Plans for three wind farms in the south of Scotland have been revealed.
"Paul Thomas, from Telford, was jailed for 10 years in April for the manslaughter of his son Oliver Sargent.
Oliver's mother Ashlea was convicted of causing or allowing his death.
The infant could have been removed from his home had the abuse been recognised earlier, the review concluded.
Oliver's parents, whose relationship was described in the report as ""unstable"", took him to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford on four occasions.
He was was seen by a number of doctors there and one questioned if the injuries could have been non-accidental, but another, a consultant, accepted Oliver's mother's claim that he was a ""very active child who rolled on to toys"".
The report, which refers to Oliver as Child B, stated: ""Although there is no guarantee, there is a probability that had health professionals been clearer in recognising that there was no plausible explanation for the injuries, Child B would have been subjected to child protection procedures and consideration given to protecting Child B by removing them from the home.
""Health professionals were in a position to raise concerns when Child B was observed to have bruising and occipital swelling.
""The parents either gave no explanation for the bruising or the explanation was questionable.""
Oliver died in hospital on 27 July 2012, five days after sustaining a skull fracture during an assault. His injuries were consistent with shaking.
He was not previously known to social care services or police, the report said.
Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court were told at his parents' trial that Oliver had injuries consistent with a 40mph car crash.
A post-mortem examination showed he had 13 separate marks on his body and face and had been subjected to at least one impact to the left side of his head.
Further medical investigations discovered historical injuries, including two fractured ribs and a broken collarbone, all of which had healed.
Paul Thomas was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter, while Ashlea Thomas was cleared of both murder and manslaughter. She was given a two-year jail term, suspended for two years, for causing or allowing her son's death.
The report set out a number of recommendations for agencies.
It said Shropshire Community Health Trust (SCHT) responses to bruising seen in young children must be improved, consideration should be given to seeing a child's father and injuries should not be seen in isolation, but considered with other concerns.
In cases where a child has life-threatening injuries out of office hours, senior managers of children's social care should be alerted.
The review noted poor quality in recording of injuries at Princess Royal Hospital and a lack of consideration of previous admission and/or injuries.
Andrew Tapp, from the Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, described Oliver's death as ""tragic"" and said a number of changes had been made.
""Among these changes, any incident where there is the suspicion that injuries may be non-accidental is recorded using a body map to show the position of the injuries, along with measurements and full details.
""A system has also been established to ensure clinical photographs are taken 24-hourly on the children's ward. This improved recording of injuries ensures a more timely referral to social care should the situation arise.
""Should there be any difference of opinion between doctors about the nature of a child's injuries, the opinion of a dedicated named or designated doctor, who specialises in child protection, is sought.""
Andrew Mason, of the Telford & Wrekin Safeguarding Children Board, said GPs are now referring more people when there is evidence of bruising.
""We are confident that message has got across,"" he said.","Health professionals missed ""several opportunities"" to safeguard an 11-month-old boy before he died of a skull fracture inflicted by his father, a serious case review has found."
"The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) expressed ""serious concerns"" to the European Commission about the deal.

The European Commission has until 19 May to make a decision on Three's proposed £10.5bn takeover of O2.
Hutchison said: ""It is no surprise that CMA opposes the merger. It always has, and so has Ofcom. But it is for the Commission to assess any competition concerns, on the basis of the facts and proposed remedies.""
Sky, Virgin, Tesco and UK Broadband have agreed to use Three-O2's share of UK airwaves to offer their own mobile packages, the company said.
""The entry of so many diverse, strong and committed players will ensure that there is plenty of competition in the UK market and plenty of counter offers to any supposed price increases post-merger,"" it said.
Three's owner added that it would invest £5bn in UK mobile infrastructure and that new entrants would add a further £5bn.
The planned purchase of O2 by Hutchison, which is owned by Asia's richest person Li Ka-shing, was announced early last year.
If approved, the deal would leave just two other major UK operators: EE and Vodafone.
Hutchison sent its suggested remedies to the European Commission last week to smooth the takeover.
The CMA said the remedies ""fall well short"" and insisted the Commission should instead force most of O2 or Three's mobile network to be sold off after the deal.
""Absent such structural remedies, the only option available to the Commission is prohibition,"" Alex Chisholm, chief executive of the CMA, said in the letter to the European Commission.
European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager will make the final decision on the deal, rather than UK regulators.
""At best we see UK deal approval odds at 50/50. The risk, here, is the decision could become increasingly political (from a UK perspective it already is) as it's so close to the Brexit vote,"" said Mandeep Singh, a partner at Redburn analysts.
Campaigners for a British exit from the EU - known as ""Brexit"" - have already raised concerns about the European Commission having the final say instead of the CMA or Ofcom.
The Commission has previously approved deals in Ireland, Austria and Germany that reduced the number of mobile networks from four to three.
The UK telecoms market is going through significant change, with broadband, mobile and subscription TV providers increasingly competing with each other.
BT re-entered the mobile market earlier this year after its £12.5bn takeover of EE was approved by the CMA.
Tom Mockridge, Virgin Media chief executive, said: ""A combined O2-Three would provide a counter balance to the strength of BT/EE, offering an alternative source of capacity to other providers who will drive competition in their own right.""","The planned merger of mobile networks O2 and Three should be blocked or severely restricted by EU regulators, the UK competition watchdog has said."
"Millie the cat has been left with a suspected broken jaw from the attack, which the RSPCA described as ""sickening"".
The video shows two men walking towards Millie in Derby, then one kicks her and she flies several feet in the air.
It happened outside the Guinness Trust flats in Sidney Street at about 16:25 GMT on Thursday.
RSPCA inspector Sarah Burrows said: ""It is an unprovoked attack which has sadly left Millie with a suspected broken jaw.
""Inflicting such a horrific attack on a defenceless cat is sickening and it's important we track down the people responsible.""
The charity asked anyone with information to contact them.
They warned that anyone found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal could face up to six months in prison and a fine of up to Â£20,000.","The RSPCA is trying to find a man who was caught on CCTV kicking a cat ""very hard"" into the air."
"The Houthi delegation, which was due to arrive on Sunday, was still in Djibouti in east Africa on Monday evening.
Mr Ban warned that ""while the parties bicker, Yemen burns"" and urged an immediate humanitarian ceasefire.
An estimated 20 million Yemenis are in need of aid following months of fighting in the country.
The humanitarian situation has been described as ""catastrophic"" by the UN, with more than 2,000 people killed in the conflict.
Opening the talks, Mr Ban said: ""Today Yemen's very existence hangs in the balance.""
He urged action on three main areas: ""First, a renewed humanitarian pause to allow critical assistance to reach all Yemenis in need and provide a respite for Yemenis as the holy month of Ramadan begins.
""Second, I urge the parties to reach agreement on local ceasefires. Third, I call on them to resume a peaceful and orderly political transition and to ensure that the process includes more representation from other political parties, women, youth and civil society.""
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva said the Houthi representatives were apparently delayed over what airspace their plane could fly through. She said that the confusion did not bode well for the talks.
A Saudi-led coalition of Arab states has been bombing the Houthi rebels and their allies since March.
The bombing campaign was launched to support Yemeni President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who escaped to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, when the Houthis advanced on his stronghold in Aden in southern Yemen.
In recent weeks, fighting between Saudi forces and the Houthis has intensified on Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia.
On Saturday, Saudi Arabia claimed to have shot down a Scud missile fired by the Houthis.
The attack followed fighting on the border on Friday, in which four Saudi soldiers and a number of Yemeni rebels died.

"Flintshire factory cleaner Trevor Fletcher, 60, fell unconscious at work in Deeside's Toyota Manufacturing UK.
Prompt life-saving action from colleagues kept him alive until the air ambulance team arrived from Welshpool.
Dr John Glen, an anaesthetist on board, said teamwork at all stages had helped to save Mr Fletcher.
He works at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire and also with the Emergency Medical Retrival and Transfer Service Cymru.
He said: ""The patient was given first aid and CPR by a colleague, a defibrillator was on hand, paramedics arrived to give more intensive resuscitation and insert a tube to help him breathe.
""The helicopter was able to reach him quickly and had an expert on board, and finally he was flown directly a specialist cardiac centre.
""Without all these stages, he probably won't have made it - if he had, he would be in a bad way, and certainly not up and about in a few weeks, cracking jokes.""
Once Mr Fletcher was stabilised, he was flown to the North Wales Cardiac Centre at Glan Clwyd where he was treated at a specialist laboratory, and then transferred to Arrowe Park Hospital in the Wirral to be closer to his family.
Once he recovered, Mr Fletcher, who lives in Birkenhead, travelled to Welshpool where the air ambulance is based, to meet Dr Glen and the team to say thank you.
""I hadn't been feeling well for a while, with a cough, and finally went to see my GP, who gave me antibiotics and said there was a problem with my chest,"" he said.
""I didn't realise it at the time, but it was actually pneumonia, which was only confirmed when I was at Glan Clwyd.
""I was at work and said to my colleagues I felt unwell and was going out for some fresh air.
""When I didn't come back they went to find me and a security guard found me unconscious.
""Really, the first I knew was waking up in Arrowe Park hospital.
""It's thanks to the doctors on the helicopter, and all the medical staff in the two hospitals, that I am alive now and I am able to go back to work, plus spend time with my family.""","A man who was ""dead"" for almost an hour after suffering a cardiac arrest has visited the flying doctors who saved him to say thank you."
"The strikes by RMT, Aslef and Unite union members will start on the evenings of 26 January, 15 February and 17 February.
RMT General Secretary Mick Cash said the plans to introduce a Night Tube were ""bodged"".
London Underground called the unions' position ""absurd"".
It has offered a four-year pay deal over the issue and said it would hire part-time drivers to staff an all-night service at weekends.
More on this and other London stories.
Aslef claimed earlier London Underground management had refused to meet to discuss conditions for working on the proposed Night Tube.
The union's London district organiser, Finn Brennan, said: ""We genuinely regret the inconvenience that will be caused but the behaviour of London Underground's senior management team have left us with no other choice.
Steve Griffiths, LU's chief operating officer, responded: ""The unions' position is absurd and detached from the real world.""
He added: ""The truth is that they expect our customers to pay for their excessive demands for even more money, fewer hours and a four-day week.""
""No employer could allow this and strike action will change nothing. There is no more money.""
The Night Tube, which was due to begin in September, will see 24-hour services on five lines on Fridays and Saturdays.
Tube drivers are also unhappy with pay and station rosters, according to BBC London transport correspondent Tom Edwards.
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said the union supported the principle of a ""properly worked-out night Tube service"" but said an ""abject failure to work through the detail has led to a comprehensive breakdown in the negotiations"".
London Mayor Boris Johnson said: ""If a strike goes ahead, it will hit many London Underground workers who do not necessarily support the action, and it will cost the strikers in lost pay.""
But Labour mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan said Mr Johnson was to blame, arguing: ""It proves once and for all that the Tory strategy of refusing to negotiate or even meet with the unions makes strikes more likely not less.""
Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA, which represents office and ticket staff, said the union will be consulting members over the next week to decide its next move.",London Underground staff are to stage three 24-hour strikes and other industrial action over pay and night Tubes.

""It is such an exhilarating thing to watch when you see people bouncing so high in the air and then landing in such a small square. It is one of the sports where the margin for error is so slim. You can be in the lead and one little small movement finishes you. This means that there is often a surprise winner. The really strong nations are Russia, China and Canada.""
The top competitors in the world are still genuine high-flyers though, reaching heights of up to 10 metres during their routines.
Although it forms part of the gymnastics programme it shares some similarities with diving in terms of the suppleness and skill needed to compete at the top level. The two sports also share the same terminology - back-flips and half-pikes feature in both.
Lee Brearley and Jaime Moore were the first Britons to compete when trampoline made its Olympic debut at the Sydney 2000 Games.
Britain had previously produced world men's champions Paul Luxon (1972) and Stewart Matthews (1980) as well as Sue Shotton, who took the 1988 women's world title.
Gymnastics requires strength, mobility, endurance, flexibility, body control and coordination.
The high level of physical fitness needed to excel helps encourage a healthy lifestyle, including regular physical activity and eating a well-balanced diet.
The wide range of movements involved in trampolining works every muscle in the body and burns approximately 410 calories per hour.
Jumping on the trampoline - or rebounding - has been discovered by NASA scientists to be up to 68% more effective exercise than jogging.
The effort of rebounding develops both upper and body strength without putting undue strain on joints or muscles, thus reducing the risk of injury.
Gymnastics is a breathtaking sport featuring a range of disciplines such as artistic, trampoline, acrobatics, aerobics and tumbling. It is enjoyed by an estimated four million people in the United Kingdom.

Judges mark trampolinists on difficulty, execution and flight time during short routines which contain a series of moves such as somersaults and twists. Trampolinists can also lose points for infringements such as landing on the frame of the trampoline or taking too long to start their routine.
The difficulty score starts at 0.0 and increases with every skill performed. The execution score begins at 10.0 and decreases with every error.
Scores from the qualifying round are not carried over into the final. However, the qualifying scores determine the competition order in the final, with the highest scorer going last.
Move names include the Adolph, Barani, Fliffus and Rudolph.

A French tumbler named Du Trampolin had the idea of adapting safety nets used by aerial artists in his act.
The trampoline bed, which is made from nylon or string material, is only six millimetres thick
This rudimentary trampoline was developed into the modern apparatus we know today during the 1930s by American gymnast George Nissen, who thought it would be a useful training tool for tumblers. It was subsequently used in the training of fighter pilots and astronauts.
Gradually it developed into a sport of its own, initially known as rebound tumbling, which Essex teacher Ted Blake brought to these shores in 1950. Great Britain staged the first World Championships in 1964.
Nissen was present in Sydney in 2000 as trampoline finally became an Olympic sport.
More on the IOC website","From the circus tent to the Olympic hall, trampoline has travelled a considerable distance from its 19th Century genesis."
"But if the health service is to thrive in the 21st Century that will have to change.
There will need to be a third pillar - the community service (or integrated care as it is known in the NHS).
The term covers services aimed at people with long-term conditions. They are the patients who need care as there is no cure.
Oldham's Musculoskeletal Partnership provides an integrated service for rheumatology and orthopaedic patients.
It involves GPs, hospital consultants, physiotherapists, podiatrists and occupational therapy.
The team sees about 10,000 patients a year with conditions such as inflammatory arthritis.
It has proved so successful that rheumatology services have now been decommissioned from the local hospital, while all outpatient orthopaedics work from physiotherapy to pain management is done at the clinic.
It includes diabetes patients who need their treatment regimes closely monitored and regular foot and eye checks.
It also covers support and rehabilitation for the frail and vulnerable when they are released from hospital and help for people with dementia to stay independent.
But the problem with the current system is that they often do not get the help they need or do not get it early enough.
The result? They eventually end up in hospital more ill than they would have been.
This is bad for the individual and bad for the health service - as hospital care is more expensive.
Jennifer Dixon, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think-tank, says this is the crux of the issue.
""We have talked about integrated care for so long, but I think this time it will be different.
""It has to be because of the money situation. We have no choice.""
A quick look at the statistics proves this.
An estimated 15 million people in England have a long-term condition - a quarter of the population.
But they account for Â£7 out of every Â£10 spent on the health and care.
In Grimsby most adult health and social care outside hospital is provided by Care Plus Group, a not-for-profit organisation paid for by the NHS and local authority.
It provides nearly 50 services, covering everything from  community nursing to meals on wheels and drugs and alcohol support. All can be accessed via a single phone number.
An example of this is the Hope Specialist Service, a community centre staffed by volunteers with support from health workers, including physios, occupational therapists and specialist nurses.
It offers help for people after falls and those with lung disease so they can recover their confidence, independence and find friends. It has proved successful at keeping people out of hospital
With the number of patients expected to rise in the coming years, particularly the group with multiple conditions, that is clearly unsustainable.
With the right treatment, many of these patients do not need to be in hospital.
But the fact remains that nearly three quarters of beds are occupied by someone with a long-term condition.
The NHS Confederation recently looked at this issue, concluding there needed to be a radical rethink.
Jo Webber, director of policy at the confederation, explains: ""For too long, the default setting when we think about healthcare or support is to think of a hospital.
""But in reality, acute hospitals - whether major teaching sites or local district generals - are rarely the best place for someone who needs ongoing health or treatment.""
Mike Dixon, of the NHS Alliance, which has championed the changes, agrees, arguing that by giving power to GPs the shake-up will help change the mindset of the NHS.
""We cannot carry on as we are. We are the most prolific users of hospitals in the Western world. It is now time to base services in the community, to pool budgets and design services around the patient.
""Hospitals admissions should be seen as a failure from now on.""",Ever since the NHS was created it has been dominated by two services - hospitals and GP care.
"Webber, who arrived from Huddersfield in April, is heading up the search for a permanent replacement for Alex Neil.
""We have a list of candidates, and once their seasons are finished, we can start to accelerate that process,"" Webber told BBC Radio Norfolk.
Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill has distanced himself from the role.
Neil was sacked by the Canaries on 10 March, with Alan Irvine taking the team on an interim basis for the rest of the season.
Webber said he still expected the new head coach to be in place by the end of May.
""We have a clear idea of the type of person it'll be,"" he added.
""Things are a little bit slow because people's seasons are still going on and we have to be respectful of that.
""There's certain rules that we have to adhere by.""
Webber also reaffirmed Norwich's interest in signing Ajax left-back Mitchell Dijks, 24, on a permanent deal, following a successful loan spell, while playing down speculation over Steven Naismith's future at Carrow Road.
""With Mitchell, we have the option to buy him, so to a certain degree it's our call,"" he said.
""We need to agree personal terms and from a financial point of view we need to be creative with the squad, so if that means Mitchell or any other player we're trying to get falls out of that, we can't do it.
""I had a laugh with Steven the other day about what came out of the media in Scotland, saying he was going to be let go on a free.
""It's news to me, and it's news to Steven. He's a good player, we all know that, [with] unbelievable experience at the highest level, in terms of international football.
""He's our player, he's under contract.""","Norwich City's next head coach will come from a shortlist of managers currently in jobs, sporting director Stuart Webber has said."
"Three weeks on from the violence, the bullet holes that pockmarked the windows of La Bonne Biere are gone and Parisians have returned to its terrace.
""It is time for us to gather together again, united, and to go forward in order not to forget,"" the owners said.
The attacks on 13 November left 130 people dead and more than 350 wounded.
Close-circuit cameras at La Bonne Biere recorded the moment two gunmen approached the cafe and opened fire at those sitting on the terrace.
Piles of flowers and candles still line the pavement where the victims died, but for the first time in three weeks on Friday a handful of customers returned to the tables and chairs outside.
A banner above the entrance reads ""Je suis en terrasse"" - I am on the terrace - a message of defiance popular among Parisians in the wake of the attacks.
Manager Audrey Bily thanked supporters and said the cafe would ""bounce back"".
""I would like to thank everyone who has supported us for your poems, your messages and posts that have so helped us,"" she said.
""We are going to start again, to bounce back. We have carried out some work and repainted the walls to wipe away the signs of this nightmare.
""The Bonne Biere cafe was a place where people meet and exchanged and shared. That is what we want it to be again today.""
A handwritten message on a blackboard outside the cafe offered condolences to the victims' families and thanked the emergency services at the scene that night.
Paule Zlotnik, a neighboring shopkeeper, praised the cafe's decision to reopen. ""It's time they open and that we continue life as it was before,"" he said.
The Casa Nostra restaurant opposite the cafe, which was also hit, remains closed. The four other cafes and restaurants targeted in the attacks as well as the nearby Bataclan concert hall, where 89 people died, are also still closed.",A Paris cafe where five people were killed during the terror attacks last month reopened its doors on Friday - the first of the targets to do so.

"The visitors were closing in on three points thanks to Christian Nade's first-half penalty and a fine finish from Robert Thomson.
But Martin Boyle's late effort - after Daniel Harvie scored an own goal and James Keatings had a penalty saved - earned Hibs a point.
A mistake from goalkeeper Alan Martin handed Boyle the equaliser.
It meant two lost points for Dumbarton, who fall behind Raith Rovers, into eighth spot after the Kirkcaldy side's win over Dundee United.
Dumbarton looked extremely well organised at the back in the first half, with space for the Hibs strikers at a premium.
And the visitors were awarded the chance to take a shock first-half lead when Marvin Bartley needlessly bundled Andy Stirling to the ground just inside the home team's 18-yard box.
Former Hearts striker Christian Nade made no mistake in despatching the ball beyond goalkeeper Ofir Marciano.
When the home side equalised through a Harvie own goal, few inside the ground would have expected anything else other than Hibs going on to secure a victory.
However, Thomson restored the visitors' lead with a stunning shot from 22 yards out to give the travelling support hope their team could secure their first win at Easter Road in more than 30 years.
Martin, on loan from Hamilton Academical, had an afternoon he is likely to remember for a long long time.
He kept Hibs at bay with stunning saves from Keatings and Brian Graham. None better than the penalty stop from Keatings that denied Hibs an equaliser after they laid siege on the visitors' goal.
However, only he knows what he was thinking about when he dropped the ball on the edge of his box, allowing Boyle to nod the ball into the empty net to salvage a point.
If, or indeed when, Neil Lennon manages to get his Hibs side over the line and secure their place back at Scottish football's top table, he will have plenty to think about regarding who he should retain on the playing staff.
With 10 draws in the league this season, the Easter Road side are far from the finished article and the inconsistency shown at times by many of his squad could lead them towards the exit door in the summer.
With two huge games coming up in the next 10 days against their closest challengers, Falkirk and Greenock Morton, the league title could all but be in the bag.
However, any slip ups and those two, under two of the shrewdest managers around, Peter Houston and Jim Duffy, will look to pounce.
Hibernian head coach Neil Lennon: ""I'm frustrated as we deserved to win the game. Ridiculous goals we are giving away.
""Our attitude towards the game in the first half wasn't good enough.
""This team has to be more consistent. I'm not scratching my head because I see it so often now.
""We are at home, but the malaise sets in and they are not learning.
""If they think they are going to get to the Premiership playing like that, they won't - and, if they think they are going to play like that in the Premiership, they will have to think again because it's not acceptable.""
Dumbarton manager Stephen Aitken: ""I certainly enjoyed the performance of the players. We enjoyed the result.
""It could have been a bit better, but if we are assessing the game in an honest manner then Hibs bossed the game in the second half.
""The goalkeeper makes a save from the penalty, so we have to be happy. He is gutted about the equaliser, but at the same time, he kept us in the game.
""He walked in and apologised for costing his team three points, but I said to him he gained us a point.""

This is always the least impressive time of year for Apple's earnings, come as it does after the Christmas period. But worse-than-expected iPhone sales had investors slightly unhappy after anticipation of strong earnings sent shares to record highs earlier on Tuesday.
That said, revenues are up, in part because of ""robust"" sales of the iPhone 7 Plus, the bigger, pricier model.

"Margaret Chisholm told the High Court in Glasgow that her brother Ronnie Coulter made the admission to her after a jury cleared him of the murder.
She also said that when he was on remand awaiting trial, Mr Coulter neither admitted or denied the murder.
Mr Coulter denies murdering Mr Chhokar and has blamed two other men.
The 48-year-old, from Wishaw, denies stabbing the 32-year-old in Garrion Street, Overtown, North Lanarkshire, on 4 November 1998.
Mr Coulter has lodged a special defence blaming his nephew Andrew Coulter - Mrs Chisholm's son - and another man, David Montgomery.
Mrs Chisholm was giving evidence as the trial entered its fourth week.
She told prosecutor Alex Prentice QC that hours after her brother was cleared of murdering Mr Chhokar in 1999, he visited her home in Overtown.
Mr Prentice asked her: ""Why was he there?"" and Mrs Chisholm replied: ""Because he'd just been found not guilty. He was sitting on the floor in the living room leaning against a radiator.""
The prosecutor then asked: ""What did he say?"" and she replied: "" He said 'I've just got away with the perfect murder.'""
Mrs Chisholm also told the court that her brother said: ""He took one off me, so I took one off him.""
She said she believed this was a reference to God and the fact that Mr Coulter had a baby girl that was stillborn.
Mr Prentice also asked her about a visit she made to her brother in Barlinnie Prison in 1998 or 1999, while he was on remand awaiting trial.
The prosecutor asked if she had asked him anything and Mrs Chisholm replied: ""If he done it. If it was him that done Chhokar.""
Mr Prentice said: ""Did he answer?"" and She replied: ""He said 'Mmhmm.' He never said aye or nah.""
The witness said that was all she could remember about their conversation in the prison.
Mr Prentice also showed Mrs Chisholm a transcript from another murder trial in 2000, where her son Andrew and Mr Montgomery were the accused. Both were later cleared of murder.
In the transcript Mrs Chisholm had said her brother told her he had stabbed Mr Chhokar.
The prosecutor then asked: ""Did you tell the truth on oath when you gave evidence in that trial?"" and she answered: ""Yes.""
Mrs Chisholm told the jurors that Mr Coulter phoned her from prison while he was on remand and asked her to search for a tammy (hat), with a knife wrapped inside it, on the old railway line between Overtown and Gowkthrapple.
She said: ""I went with my daughter Rona and my son Andrew, but with no intentions of finding them. It was freezing. We took the dog for a walk.""
Mrs Chisholm claimed that in an earlier phone call her brother asked her to go to Wishaw market, along with his former girlfriend Alexandra Tierney, and purchase a box of knives.
She was asked what she was to do with the box of knives and replied: ""Take the smallest one out and put it in Ronnie's cutlery drawer.""
The court was told she never did this, but kept the box of knives.
Under cross-examination by defence QC Donald Findlay, Mrs Chisholm denied that she was making up lies about her brother to help her son, Andrew.
Mr Findlay said: ""You would be anxious to do all you could to protect your boy,"" and Mrs Chisholm replied: ""No , if he had killed him I'd be standing in this box saying my son did it.""
Referring to her evidence the QC added: ""This is just a concoction of lies to get Andrew off at Ronnie's expense."" Mrs Chisholm replied: ""No.""
Mr Findlay asked why she had not phoned the police when Mr Coulter allegedly mentioned the knife in the tammy.
He went on: ""Why did you not tell the police anonymously about this,"" and Mrs Chisholm responded: ""It would have been like looking for a needle in a haystack.""
The QC then said: ""One explanation might be that you were terrified in case it was Andrew's DNA or fingerprints on it,"" and she replied: ""No.""
Mr Findlay added: ""Your evidence has been a pack of lies from beginning to end."" Mrs Chisholm said: ""I'm not a liar. I'm not lying in court.""
The jury has previously heard that Mr Coulter, his nephew Andrew and Mr Montgomery went to Mr Chhokar's home at Garrion Street, Overtown, around 23:30 on the night he died to speak to him about a Giro cheque which had allegedly been stolen from him.
Andrew Coulter and Mr Montgomery have given evidence in which they denied having anything to do with the killing of Mr Chhokar.
Ronnie Coulter denies all the charges against him.

"Team GB skier Tim Farr's £5,000 handbike was found after a social media campaign.
It had been sold for £150 at a Cash Converters shop in south London.
Mr Farr, who was a member of the British Disabled Ski team at the Vancouver Paralympics in 2010, thanked people on social media for finding the bike.
On Facebook, he wrote: ""Thank you again to all the amazing people, those who I know and don't, who shared my posts in the search of my stolen bike.
""It has been an amazing couple of days and has restored my faith in humanity.""
He said his original call for help had been shared more than 3,500 times and that celebrities and MPs had helped with retweets.
The bike was taken from his car parked outside his home near Balham, south-west London, at about 04:00 BST on 21 April.
Police retrieved the bike after being alerted via social media by people who had spotted it in the shop.
More than £1,700 was raised on a crowd funding website to pay for a new bike for the skier.

Hull hammered Dyche's men 3-0 when the two sides last met on Boxing Day, but a repeat of that never looked likely with the hosts deserving their narrow win.
Barton came close to opening the scoring after half an hour when his skidding free-kick forced a low save from McGregor before the keeper denied the same player from a header.
The pivotal moment in the game came in the 77th minute when Wales international Vokes reacted quickest to McGregor's save from another Barton effort.
Hull substitute Chuba Akpom had a shot saved but he could not prevent his side suffering a first defeat since 28 December.
Burnley manager Sean Dyche:
""I always knew it was going to be tight, but looking back I think we controlled the quality of the game overall.
""Hull are a very strong defensive side with a real depth of experience, but we've managed to breach them one more time than they breached us.
""We're right up there in the hunt, but nothing will be decided yet.""
Hull manager Steve Bruce:
""There was loads of heart and endeavour out there, and that from two top-class teams. It was never going to be a classic in weather like that.
""We carved out some great chances, but maybe we just missed that killer instinct in front of goal that you need.
""We've lost, but you just have to accept the result and move on. And we will do.
""We've played well in really difficult conditions. It's been an opportunity missed for us to create a bit of daylight at the top, but I couldn't fault the players.""

"He said the Nord Stream pipeline would reduce Russia's dependence on Ukrainian pipelines, which were shut during gas disputes between Moscow and Kiev.
""Technical gas"", needed to build up pressure, was released on Tuesday.
It is expected German consumers will begin receiving Russian gas through the new pipeline in a few weeks.
The official launch of Nord Stream will be marked with a visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Germany in November.
Nord Stream, a twin pipeline, was built at a cost of $12.5bn (Â£7.7bn; 8.8bn euros) and is 1,224km (761 miles) long, running from Vyborg in north-west Russia to Sassnitz in north-east Germany.
It should be able to move 55bn cu m of gas a year by 2013, after the completion of the second pipeline.
Mr Putin, visiting Vyborg, said Ukraine had been ""taking advantage"", and that relations between the two countries would now become ""more civilised"".
At present, 80% of Russia's gas exports to the EU flow through pipelines across Ukrainian soil.
Apart from Nord Stream, Russia has been planning another pipeline, South Stream, which will run from southern Russia to Bulgaria under the Black Sea.
The project is expected to pipe 63bn cu m of gas to central and southern Europe annually.
In another project to pipe ex-Soviet gas westwards, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria have agreed to construct a 3,900km pipeline called Nabucco.
It is expected to pump up to 31bn cubic metres of gas annually from the Caspian and the Middle East across Turkey and into Europe.",Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has pressed the start button to open a pipeline carrying natural gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea.
"It includes new taxes on businesses and the wealthy, Giorgios Stathakis told the BBC in an exclusive interview.
Eurozone finance ministers have welcomed the plan, saying there could be a deal ""within days"".
Greece will default if it does not repay a €1.6bn (£1.1bn) IMF loan by the end of the month.
If that happens, it risks crashing out of the single currency and possibly the EU.
Mr Stathakis told the BBC's Robert Peston he was confident Greece's new proposals to balance the government's books had broken the deadlock with its creditors.
""We [will] try to remove the tax burden from pensions and wages towards business and the wealthy,"" he said.
He said the proposals also included an increase in the VAT rate for some selected items.
Greece's economy minister Giorgios Stathakis told me that his Syriza government, led by Alexis Tsipras, had avoided crossing its red lines with the new proposals.
So, he said, there would be no further reductions in pensions or public-sector wages. And there would be no increase in VAT on electricity.
He also said that the government had agreed with the IMF and eurozone governments that the targeted budget surplus would be 1% of GDP or national income this year, 2% next year and 3% the year after.
There will be no agreement with creditors to cut Greece's massive burden of debt, despite Syriza's earlier insistence on this. But Mr Stathakis told me he expects eurozone government heads to issue a communique later saying that debt relief will be on the agenda for negotiation in coming months.

Speaking ahead of an emergency Eurogroup summit in Brussels on Monday, European Council president Donald Tusk said the latest Greek proposals were the ""first real proposals in many weeks"".
""This evening I want all cards on the table. That doesn't mean I want to negotiate technical details, but it means I want to end this political gambling,"" he said.
Talks have been in deadlock for five months. The European Commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) are unwilling to unlock the final €7.2bn tranche of bailout funds until Greece agrees to economic reforms.
Separately, the European Central Bank (ECB) again increased its emergency funding for Greek banks after anxious savers withdrew more than €4bn in recent days.
Greek PM Alexis Tsipras, who has ruled out pension cuts, higher power rates, and an excessive budget surplus, said he hoped Greece would ""return to growth within the eurozone"".
He met the heads of Greece's three international creditors in Brussels, ahead of his talks with the leaders of 18 other eurozone nations later on Monday.
But eurozone finance ministers said they were not given enough time to study them for a proper assessment, amid confusion over different versions of the Greek proposals submitted.
Speaking after the meeting, Mr Dijsselbloem described the proposals as ""broad and comprehensive"", but said work was needed to check they added up ""in fiscal terms"".
One of the key power-brokers, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters his goal was to find an agreement ""by the end of the week"".
Earlier, Germany's Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters he had not seen anything new from Greece so far and ""without anything new, there is nothing for the ministers to prepare for their leaders"". The Irish and Finnish finance ministers echoed the sentiment.
News of a possible breakthrough gave a boost to European stock markets, with Greece's main stock exchange jumping 9% by the end of trading on Monday.
The deadline for Greece to pay back a slice of its loan is 30 June, but a last-minute deal would make it difficult to arrange the logistics of transferring the money.

"They were among a group of suspects acquitted in Kenya last week.
Taiwan's foreign ministry says they were forcibly put on a China-bound plane and has demanded their release.
China has not responded in detail to the allegations, but has criticised Taiwan for not considering itself as part of ""one China"".
The incident comes as cross-strait relations are feared to be entering a rocky period, say the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei.
Taiwan said the eight were among 23 Taiwanese people who were accused in Kenya of being members of a telephone fraud ring, which also included Chinese nationals.
They were arrested in Kenya at the end of last year and charged with illegal entry and telecommunications fraud.
All of the Taiwanese, and some Chinese, were later acquitted.
The Taiwanese were detained when they went to a police station last week to retrieve their passports.
On Friday, eight of them were put on a plane by Chinese officials and sent to the mainland, despite a court order that would have kept them in Kenya, say Taiwanese officials.
Taiwan has demanded their release, as well as for the release of the remaining 15 Taiwanese still in Kenyan custody.
On Monday, Taiwan's foreign affairs ministry accused Chinese officials of ""obstructions"", including delaying the court order and preventing Taiwan's representative from reaching the acquitted.
It said China's actions amounted to an ""uncivilised act of extrajudicial abduction"" which represents a ""gross violation of basic human rights.""
In response to a reporter's question on the matter, China's foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said: ""I might need further understanding of the exact details of the case, but in principle, countries which follow the 'one China' principle are worthy of approval.""
Beijing has refused to have dialogue with Taiwan's incoming President Tsai Ing-wen unless she recognises the two sides as part of one country.

"The centre in Deptford, south-east London, provides training for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.
It was founded by Baroness Lawrence in memory of her son who was killed in a racist attack by white youths in 1993.
The Cambridges also visited XLP urban Christian charity in Gypsy Hill.
Baroness Lawrence showed the royal couple the Harris Academy law workshop that aims to raise pupils' career ambitions through lectures and mentoring.
She also showed them a digital journalism project called The Write Way that encourages young people to develop their literacy and IT skills.
""It was a quite amazing visit,"" she said. ""The duke and duchess spent a really good time talking to our young people and showed genuine interest in what they were doing.""
Stephen Lawrence was stabbed to death at the age of 18 by a group of white youths near a bus stop in Eltham, south-east London.
He aspired to become an architect and the charity was set up by his mother in his memory in 1998, originally to provide support and bursaries to budding architects.
Staff and volunteers at the centre wished the couple good luck with their new baby, which William said was due ""any day now"".
Catherine is believed to be around eight months pregnant and is expected to give birth at the end of April.
Before leaving the centre Stephen Lawrence's 10-year-old niece Mia presented the duchess with flowers and revealed that she liked to cook shepherd's pie, to which William replied: ""I quite like shepherd's pie, I will have to pop round and try it.""
William and Catherine then visited Christ Church in Gypsy Hill, south London, to find out about the work of XLP.
XLP describes itself as a Christian urban youth charity operating in seven London boroughs that helps  young people from deprived inner city estates to realise their potential.
Many of the people it seeks to help are coping with family breakdown, unemployment, gang life and educational failure.

"The local authority was expecting to have to tackle a funding gap of more than £21m, but that figure has been revised up to £40m.
The council said the figure was reviewed following last week's UK government Autumn Statement.
Senior councillors said they wanted to protect education from cuts and avoid compulsory redundancies.
Council leader Margaret Davidson said the Autumn Statement had included a 4-5% cut to Scotland's budget and this would filter down to local authorities in terms of less funding from the Scottish government.
She told BBC Alba that trying to find savings of £21m, which was on top of £10m of cuts already agreed for 2016-17, had been ""bad enough"".
She added: ""Now we are being told the gap could be up to £40m, almost double what we had been expecting.""

"John Lowe, who killed Christine Lee and Lucy Lee in February, was given a minimum sentence of 25 years.
The jury at his Guildford Crown Court trial was told Lowe wanted the women ""put down"".
Surrey Police has apologised for returning Lowe's confiscated guns to him seven months before the shooting.
Sentencing Lowe, Mr Justice Singh praised the ""extraordinary courage"" of Lucy Lee after she returned to face her killer after making a frantic 999 call.
He said that, having heard the evidence, he had come to the ""clear conclusion"" the 82-year-old had intended to kill both of the women.
""You shot Lucy Lee in the back of her head after she made the 999 call, then reloaded your gun and pursued her outside the cottage, with the intention of making sure that this time she died,"" he said.
In a victim impact statement Stacy Banner, Lucy Lee's sister, said she was ""haunted by what Lowe has done"".
She said Lucy was the ""big sister who comforted and preceded me"" and the murders had left her struggling to eat and sleep.
Outside court, she said: ""I'm relieved it's over. He's never getting out.""
Ms Banner has criticised police for returning guns to Lowe just months before he carried out the shootings.
Surrey Police has admitted the decision ""was flawed and did not meet national standards"".
Three Surrey Police employees are being investigated for gross misconduct by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) over the decision to return the weapons.
Christine Lee's sister, Julia James, said she felt ""despair, physically and emotionally"" since the death of her two relatives.
""I miss them more than I can say,"" she said.
At the start of the hearing, prosecutor Mark Dennis QC said Lowe's advanced age should not ""dramatically"" reduce his sentence and the ""starting point"" for a double murder of this kind would be a minimum of 30 years in jail.
Surrey's Police and Crime Commissioner Kevin Hurley said as the trial was now over the inquiry could focus on why Lowe was given back his guns.
Factors which would be investigated included whether the decision had been made because of ""human error by negligence, as a genuine mistake, or as a result of funding cuts to backroom staff"", he said.",An 82-year-old man has been jailed for life for murdering his partner and her daughter who he shot at close range at his puppy farm in Surrey.
"The trend in transport systems is towards growing automation. But it seems that plans for drivers to operate train carriage doors instead of guards can still cause industrial strife.
Not so long ago, such a change would not have been possible. As recently as 2005, some Southern services were still using old-fashioned ""slam-door"" carriages, which could be opened at any time, even while the train was moving.
These were phased out on safety grounds and replaced by sliding doors, which can be centrally locked. The question now is, who should do the locking?
As far as the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union is concerned, safety is still an important issue, and one which also forms part of its separate dispute with Virgin East Coast, where workers have also just voted to go on strike.
The RMT says that guards are needed on trains for more than just operating doors, and if that role is taken away from them, they will eventually disappear altogether, leaving no-one to protect passengers from robbery or physical attack.
Southern's response is that no-one will lose their job as a result of the change. Guards will remain on trains, but they will become ""on-board supervisors"", making them more, not less responsive to passengers' needs.
In the latest development, Southern has said it is prepared to have talks ""any time, any place, anywhere"" with the RMT in an effort to break the deadlock.
The RMT, for its part, has accused the government of blocking a deal.
Southern says 40% of its services already have ""driver-only operation"", while the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, part of the Department for Transport, says it has found ""no evidence"" that driver-only trains are unsafe.
On the other hand, Southern has said that the change will allow trains to run without a guard in the event of staff shortages, reducing the number of cancelled services.
This is a particular issue for the company, which has had to cancel large numbers of trains in recent months because of guards calling in sick.
Southern says this amounts to ""unofficial industrial action"", while the RMT says Southern is not recruiting enough staff and that many of its members are suffering from work-related stress.
Whatever the truth of the matter, it suggests that there is more to this dispute than a mere reallocation of roles.
The RMT certainly thinks that the possibility of allowing trains to leave the station without a guard on board strengthens its argument that there will be job losses in future.
So who is suffering most from this five-day strike? The RMT's members are certainly paying for their action, since they lose a week's pay, but that hardly seems to have dented their resolve.
Even so, they have failed to bring the network to a standstill, since Southern has said roughly half its trains are operating as normal - and since that ""normal"" level actually refers to an emergency timetable that already involves hundreds of cancellations, hard-pressed commuters may feel that the service can scarcely get any worse.
As for Southern, the system of government subsidies for rail franchises means that the company suffers little short-term financial penalty from the dispute. It also has a near-monopoly on many of the lines that it operates, so passengers have nowhere else to go.
So how and when is this disruption likely to end? Well, in the long run, technology is almost certain to win out - but it's unclear how long that will take.
Some rail trade unionists acknowledge that one day, the railway service is likely to be fully automated, with even train drivers becoming a thing of the past.
Mick Whelan, general secretary of train drivers' union Aslef, which is not involved in the Southern dispute, told the BBC: ""We will have a digital railway some time in the future, probably not in my lifetime.
""I'm not against technology, I'm not against advancement, but it has to be brought in in a safe, better way.""
With this kind of talk in the air, it's small wonder that many observers see this dispute as being about more than just carriage doors.
In their view, what's at stake is nothing less than the whole future shape of the railway industry in the 21st Century.
Unfortunately, that is of little consolation to long-suffering commuters who just want to be able to get to work on time.
There may be a shining future for the railway network, but from where they're standing, it looks a long way down the line.","At a time when the driverless car is said to be just around the corner, the rail dispute that has brought five days of strike action to Southern trains seems to belong to another age."
"The 26-year-old beat Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell and fellow American Michael Thompson by one shot at a foggy Olympic Club in San Francisco.
Simpson shot 68 to set the target at one over and watched as 2010 champion McDowell missed a 25ft putt to force a play-off on the 18th.
Lee Westwood took 73 for five over, while Tiger Woods (73) was seven over.
Clubhouse scores in full
Simpson, who climbs to fifth in the world, becomes the 15th different major winner in a row, the ninth straight first-time winner and the third consecutive American to win one of golf's grand slam events.
""I've never felt nerves like I felt today,"" said Simpson, who was pipped to the US money list title by England's Luke Donald last year. ""I had to hit my legs because I couldn't feel them.
""I probably prayed more the last three holes than I ever did in my life.""
Starting the final day four shots behind co-leaders McDowell and Jim Furyk, Simpson made his move with a spell of four birdies in five holes from the sixth.
Parring his way home, he bettered the clubhouse mark of first-round leader Thompson, who shot 67, and took the outright lead when Furyk, who had been in front all day and led by two at one stage, bogeyed 16.
Both 2003 champion Furyk and McDowell had a chance to force an 18-hole play-off on Monday, but the 42-year-old American finished with another bogey via the left bunker on 18 for a 74 to end two back and McDowell could only make par for a 73.
""It was grind and a slog, but I'll be back,"" said the 32-year-old McDowell, who had hoped to make it three Northern Irish wins in a row following Rory McIlroy's success last June.
""There's a mixture of emotions inside me right now, disappointment, deflation, pride but mostly just frustration.""
Furyk, whose hooked drive on the par-five 16th sparked his downfall, said: ""I don't know how to put that one into words, but I had my opportunities and my chances and it was right there.
""On that back nine, it was my tournament to win. I've only got myself to blame.""
Ireland's Padraig Harrington put up a serious challenge for a fourth major title and first since 2008 with a run of five birdies in 11 holes. But needing a birdie at the last to join Thompson, he ran up a bogey five after finding sand with his approach and ended with a 68 to finish three over.
Americans David Toms (68), John Peterson (70) and Jason Dufner (70) also finished three over with 1994 and 1997 US Open winner Ernie Els on four over.
The South African, who was third to McDowell at Pebble Beach, was one stroke off the lead after 15 but bogeyed the 16th and 18th for a 72.
We shouldn't be too surprised at Simpson's victory. Twice a winner of big tournaments on the PGA Tour last year he is part of the wave of younger American players which shows that however good European golf appears to be at the moment, things are fairly bright on the other side of the Atlantic as well.
England's world number three Lee Westwood was in contention for his first major title at the 57th attempt, but was derailed when he lost a ball, seemingly stuck up a pine tree on the fifth. He was forced to go back to the tee and play another and ran up a double bogey from which he never fully recovered, despite an eagle on 17.
Woods, chasing a 15th major title and first for four years, began bogey-bogey-double bogey and dropped six shots in his first six holes. The former world number one fought back with birdies on the eighth, 14th and 17th but could only finish in a tie for 21st with, among others, England's Justin Rose (72).
""Overall, the way I struck the golf ball, the way I controlled it all week is something that's very positive going forward,"" said the 36-year-old Woods.
""I was just a fraction off just a couple yards here and there and that's all it takes. I had so many balls that landed in the fairway that went into the rough.""",American Webb Simpson clinched his maiden major title with victory on an absorbing final day of the US Open.

Several officers fired, but only Officer Brelo faced charges. He stood on the car's bonnet and fired 15 shots through the windscreen in 7.4 seconds.

"It's a move being breathlessly described by some as the US ""giving up the internet"" to the likes of China, Russia and the Middle East.
It’s the weekend, so if you’re keen to save yourself several hundred words and get on with whatever you like to do with your free time, then here we go: No, the US hasn’t given away the internet. Don’t be absurd.
The long answer, naturally, is more complicated than that - and one mired in mistrust of one of the internet’s key organisations, the detail of which I’ll dig into in a moment.
Let’s start with the basics.
For starters, while they can take the credit for inventing the underlying technology, the US never “had the internet” to begin with. Nobody did. It’s a, duh, network. Decentralised. That’s what makes it so powerful.
But there are bits of internet infrastructure that some people and governments do have control over, and that’s what this row is all about.
One of them is the DNS -  Domain Name System. This is the system for looking after web addresses. Thanks to the DNS, when you type bbc.com, you’re taken to the correct servers for the BBC website. It saves you the grief of having to remember a string of numbers.
That pairing of names and numbers is kept in one great big master file, the land registry of the web. The only organisation that can make changes is Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.
As of Saturday 1 October 2016, Icann will no longer be under US government oversight.
Instead, it’s now a fully “multi-stakeholder” non-profit that will take on board the views of companies, experts, academics and, yes, nation states, in how the naming system of the web is run.
Here’s a crucial bit: as a user of the internet, you won’t notice any difference whatsoever. And that’s because Icann isn’t a new entity. It’s been doing precisely this job since 1998 before the vast majority of us were even online.
The switch ends a transition that has essentially been in the works for around two decades, removing a dominate power the US had by circumstance rather than intention, and one which was causing friction in the international community.
Back when there were only a handful of websites, a man named Jon Postel - nicknamed “god of the internet” - was in control of DNS.
His task was assigning the easy-to-remember names to those bothersome numbers. It was a crucial step in accelerating the popularity of the world wide web.
When it became clear this was clearly not a job for one man, however godly, a new body was set up to take over the task. They called it the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, IANA.
In 1998, control of IANA was given to the newly-formed Icann. It was given the power over internet naming globally. Experts saw Icann as a good blend of interests and expertise. One which they felt would keep the internet as open and useful as possible.
One quirk of this set-up, though, was that all the while the US’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), part of the Department of Commerce, kept its final say over what the IANA did.
In short, if Icann did something the US government didn’t like, it could step in and knock it on the head.
With the handover, that power is lost -  though it was very sparingly used.
As with most political tussles in the US, both sides say they are fighting for freedom.
Opponents of the plan, the likes of which include presidential candidate Donald Trump and his former rival Ted Cruz, say giving up the power amounts to handing it over to countries like China and Russia.
In one hearing, Senator Cruz asked if Icann - an international organisation - was bound by the First Amendment to the US constitution defending freedom of speech. No, came the reply from Icann's chief executive, Goran Marby.
Evidence enough, the senator argued, that by giving Icann complete complete control over the internet’s naming system, it could use that power to disrupt and censor communications online.
And so this week, at the eleventh hour, district attorneys representing four US states filed a legal challenge in Texas.
They had hoped to argue that the root file, the big directory of domain names and their associated servers, was US government property - and therefore required congressional approval before being ""given away"".
In court documents filed on Thursday, they also argued that without US control, well established domains like .gov and .mil (for government and military-related websites, respectively) could be tampered with.
In other words, a fully independent Icann could not be trusted and may act unpredictably once free of US oversight.
But others, including some of the web’s founding fathers, believe blocking the handover is a far bigger risk to the internet’s long term well-being.
Because if the US didn’t handover its power to Icann, it may have been cornered into doing something far riskier.
Unnerved by US power, many countries, particularly Russia and China, have pushed for the DNS to be looked after by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), which is part of the UN.
This came to a vote in 2012, but failed. The US, UK, Canada and Australia were the dissenters, refusing to back a new treaty on the grounds it could be abused to affect internet governance, and by extension, content.
In other words, the four countries were worried by sharing out ownership of the internet’s core systems, more states could act like China and clamp down on internet use on their own countries - and all would be fair under the UN.
The US opposition drew heavy criticism - as it was essentially saying no countries can be trusted to look after the internet. Except the US. That didn’t go down well.
That said, given the US was responsible for creating the internet, it did have a valid argument in taking its time in handing over DNS. But it knew time was running out - ownership of the internet’s naming system was fast becoming a diplomatic headache the US needed to solve sooner rather than later.
The handover to Icann is a compromise that appears to suit the country very nicely, and not just because Icann will remain in Los Angeles.
It has the backing of many influential experts who, to counter the likes of Senator Cruz and Mr Trump, argue those opposed to it simply have no clue what they’re talking about.
On Friday, an amicus brief was filed to the Texas court by the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), a group which represents the tech industry en masse. Its president, Dean Garfield, said: “This effort by a small number of attorneys general is misguided and inconsistent with the founding values of the Internet.
“It is an ironic endeavor because the transition will actually keep the internet an open and flourishing engine of innovation and open global communication.”
The judge agreed.
So when it comes to domain names, it's true. The US no longer has the keys to the kingdom.
But the important thing to remember is: neither does anyone else.

"The star, who had a string of pop hits in the 1960s before presenting TV shows like Blind Date and Surprise Surprise in the '80s, died on Saturday, aged 72.
A book of condolence has been opened in her home city at Liverpool Town Hall.
Childhood friend Terry McCann said Black told him she knew she was going to die and her beloved late husband Bobby Willis was ""waiting for me"".
A post-mortem examination has been carried out. The results may not be officially published for several days or possibly weeks, but Spanish police have said the indications point towards natural causes.
BBC News correspondent Robert Hall - who is in the resort of Estepona where Black lived - said she was found on her balcony by her son who was staying nearby.
He said paramedics arrived at around 18:00 local time (17:00 BST) but were unable to save her.
Mr McCann said he had seen the star in Spain during the last year.
""I wasn't surprised when I found out she had died,"" he told BBC News.
""The last thing she said to me was she was going blind, she showed me her hands, she had arthritis,"" he said. ""She willed herself to die. She said, 'Bobby's waiting for me.'
""Her mother went the same way. I don't know what her mother died of but it seemed she associated it with her mother's death and she just knew it was going to happen.
""She just said, 'Look at me, I'm a wreck.' I was trying to cheer her up. She knew something we didn't.
""She knew she was going to die and she said she wasn't going to linger like her mother.
""Her mother was ill for two years and she had the same complaint and she said she was never going to linger like that.""
Liverpool City Council say that between 400 and 500 people have so far left messages in a book of condolence at the town hall, where the flag is also flying at half mast. The book will be open to the public until Friday.
Fans signing the book on Monday included:
Sylvia Lewis (above): ""Occasionally I used to work on the cloakroom at the Cavern with her. One Saturday, when I wasn't [working], Cilla was the cloakroom girl. When it came to the end of the evening my coat had gone. Cilla had given it away to somebody else! I met Cilla at the Pride of Britain Awards every year and she always used to come up to me and say 'Girl, do you remember your coat? And we never found it, did we?'""
Ann Stalker: ""I absolutely love her. She was an icon from my era. I just wanted to pay my respects. I wrote: 'Ta-ra Cilla. You were a credit to us all. Rest in peace.'""
Cheryl McFarlane: ""She's somebody I remember so much and love very much. She's got a beautiful family and she was so wonderful to Liverpool. I just wanted to come and visit and say rest in peace.""
Since Black's death, tributes have poured in from figures ranging from UK Prime Minister David Cameron to Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr - who knew Black from the Merseybeat scene in the '60s.
Sir Paul described her as ""a lovely girl who infected everyone with her great spirit.""
TV presenter Gloria Hunniford said Black never really got over the ""deep loss"" of her husband in 1999.
""Bobby was wonderful. Wonderful as a manager and wonderful as a husband,"" Hunniford told BBC 5 live. ""She was a one-boy girl and I don't think she ever got over the vacuum of the loneliness that Bobby left.""
Actress Barbara Windsor said: ""I've seen her twice in the last few weeks. As always she looked immaculate. But I knew she wasn't very well. She didn't seem very well.""
Morrissey, who covered Black's single Work is a Four-Letter Word with The Smiths, also paid tribute.
""Never stationary throughout the 1960s, Cilla Black made some great records - The Right One Is Left, Suffer Now I Must, It's For You, I've Been Wrong Before, What Good Am I?
""I'm very grateful for the songs, and it never occurred to me that such people could die.""
Mr McCann grew up near Black and her family on Scotland Road in Liverpool.
He discovered her vocal talents when they listened to music as youngsters.
""She used to play records and sing along with them. That's when I realised. I was working at a club called The Iron Door and coaxed her to get up and sing. That was the first time she sang in public.
""Everyone was surprised by how good she was but she was very, very nervous. Eventually her confidence grew later on.""
Mr McCann arranged an audition for Black with EMI - but The Beatles' manager Brian Epstein later won her signature and took over as her manager.
Promoter Sam Leach put on the gig at The Iron Door and recalled how she ran to the toilets in tears afterwards.
""I'd realised how good she was,"" Mr Leach said. ""She was like [gospel singer] Mahalia Jackson. So when she came out I said, 'You've got a lovely voice.'""
However, she said no when Mr Leach asked her to perform the following week. ""She said, 'I'm not going to do it, I made a fool of myself,'"" Mr Leach said. ""I ignored that and put an advert in the [Liverpool] Echo.""
She had little choice but to perform the next week, Mr Leach added: ""She was brilliant. Absolutely fantastic. She gave me a big hug and said, 'Thanks, I should have listened to you.'
""That was the start of her career.""","Cilla Black was ailing and ""willed herself to die"", according to a long-time friend."

"""Where is Mullah Omar?"" is a question sources say is being increasingly and angrily directed at the commander regarded as the acting head, Akhtar Mohammad Mansour.
Commander Mansour has long been reported to be fighting off threats to his authority from more hardline Taliban opposed to any peace talks, including Abdul Qayum Zakir.
The Taliban are also facing a growing challenge from the still small, but increasingly significant presence of the so-called Islamic State in Afghanistan. Videos have emerged of disgruntled Taliban fighters swearing allegiance to the IS's self-declared Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
The Iraqi cleric, who also declared a modern day caliphate in areas under IS control in Iraq and Syria, has publicly mocked the religious and political leadership of Mullah Omar.
In a Taliban movement said to be founded on a pledge of allegiance to the Amir ul-Mumineen (Commander of the Faithful), Mullah Omar's authority was regarded as a binding force of political and military strength.
""I really hope peace talks are concluded before Mullah Omar dies,"" a former senior Taliban official nervously remarked to me several years ago with unexpected candour about the movement's leader. ""When he's gone, it will be much harder to maintain Taliban unity,"" he admitted with palpable concern.
Our conversation, outside Afghanistan, took place at a time when Nato-led forces were killing many mid-level Taliban commanders in their operations in southern Afghanistan. That was raising concern that younger, more radicalised fighters, without a strong allegiance to the Taliban leader, would rise through the ranks and be hard to keep in line.
In 2010, when US diplomats first engaged in face-to-face talks with the Taliban through what later became known as the movement's Political Office in the Gulf state of Qatar, they first sought to establish that the Talibs were acting with Mullah Omar's authority. At the time, US diplomats involved in the process told me credible assurances were received that Syed Tayyab Agha, his former personal secretary, had his blessing.
That green light was, however, said to be strictly limited to negotiations with the Americans about Taliban prisoners and the presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan.
They eventually resulted in last year's swap of the remaining American soldier in Taliban captivity, Bowe Bergdahl, for five Taliban members held at Guantanamo Bay.
This year, in the midst of a series of unprecedented informal meetings between the Taliban's Political Office and Afghan government officials, Taliban sources emphasised they still did not have formal authorisation from Mullah Omar to negotiate officially and openly with the Afghan government.
That again raised the most salient issue: how to get a ruling from a leader who has not been seen in public since late 2001 when the Taliban movement was ousted in Afghanistan after the attacks of 11 September. Even his recorded messages stopped several years ago.
Taliban officials often insisted their leader had to keep an exceptionally low profile because of US efforts to kill or capture him. But he was widely rumoured to be in Pakistan, despite Islamabad's denials. A senior Afghan official told me a few years ago that the Americans had confirmed to him that Mullah Omar was living in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi.
This month, a written message from Mullah Omar suddenly appeared,  to mark the Islamic Eid Festival. It did not directly refer to a new separate process of peace talks being organised by the Pakistani government which represented the first publicly recognised formal talks.
But the text said ""peaceful interactions with the enemies is not prohibited"" under Islamic tradition. It led to speculation over whether the message had been written by Mullah Omar himself, or someone who wanted his seal of legitimacy.
Reports of the Taliban leader's death have circulated for years but these latest ones have now emerged just days before another round of peace talks in Pakistan is about to get under way at the end of this month.
They also come at a time of disagreement over who should represent the Taliban in any negotiations with the Afghan government.
Sources say Pakistani military intelligence officers, who have long had close ties to the Taliban, are urging Taliban field commanders they have worked with to come to the table instead of members of the Political Office in Qatar with whom they have had difficult relations.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, who has adopted a new policy of working closely with the Pakistan government and military on Taliban issues, is said to be giving Islamabad considerable leeway in a negotiating process making slow and indeterminate progress.
Before the first round of talks in the Pakistani hill resort  of Murree in early July, Mr Ghani was said to be under mounting pressure to abandon his approach to Pakistan, which was markedly different from his predecessor Hamid Karzai's strained relations with Islamabad.
And there's the larger question of how committed Taliban commanders are to a political process when they continue to conduct bloody attacks not just against military and police targets but also brazen assaults on Afghan civilians everywhere from crowded markets to the country's national assembly.
Numerous countries are known to have been involved for years in secret and not so secret efforts to bring the Taliban to the table including China, Norway, Britain, and some private mediation groups.
The legitimacy conveyed by the mythical Mullah Omar was always regarded as essential even if the reclusive leader had long ceased to be involved in the day-to-day running of the movement.
Now the issue of who can replace such a powerful figurehead is emerging as one of the most significant challenges to its survival as a cohesive political and military force.","Whether or not Mullah Omar is dead or alive, his long absence from public view is posing a growing threat to the strength of his splintering Afghan Taliban movement."

Footage from the match was played to the court and newspaper reports from the time were brought to the sheriff's attention.
McDonald was seen clearly wearing a pink T-shirt and had distinctive tattoos.
The unknown Hibs fan was on the pitch after the match and was on the ground, having been assaulted by someone else.
McDonald ran over to him and pulled his right leg back to kick him but slipped and fell backwards.

"Matt Brittin said he understood public anger about the amount of tax it paid.
However, he said Google was paying 20% tax on its UK profits, not the 3% figure cited in some reports.
The £130m in UK tax it paid for the 10 years from 2005 was reached following a ""six-year rigorous, independent tax audit"" by HMRC, Mr Brittin said.
Tom Hutchinson, Google's global tax chief, told MPs that the company did not negotiate its tax settlement with HMRC.
He told the committee that the tax authorities did not ""throw out a number - it's not a negotiation"", adding: ""There was no top-line figure; that's not how the process works.""
The £130m payment included £18m in interest, Mr Hutchinson told MPs, but no penalties or payments under the government's diverted profits tax - also known as the ""Google tax"".
Today's Public Accounts Committee hearing was interesting less for Google's explanation of its tax arrangements - we've heard much of that detail before - and more for HMRC's defence of the settlement.
There Dame Lin Homer, the head of HMRC, made two significant points.
First, she said that under the law HMRC could not have demanded more from Google, pointing out that the £130m settlement was the largest the technology giant had signed outside the US.
Dame Lin said it would not have helped if HMRC had gone to court.
Certainly, proving that the company had acted ""unreasonably"" is difficult.
Second, Dame Lin said that HMRC applied the same tax laws to Google as it did to any business and that at any one time up to two-thirds of large businesses are under-going some form of tax audit process.
HMRC says it is constrained by the complicated tax laws. If they are to change, it is politicians who need to act.
MPs also questioned HMRC officials about their settlement with Google.
Jim Harra, its head of business taxation, said the company was not fined, despite underpaying tax, because proving ""insufficient care"" was ""very difficult"".
Dame Lin Homer, HMRC chief executive, admitted that the six-year investigation into Google's tax affairs took a long time to complete, but said that similar inquiries into far smaller firms could be just as lengthy.
Mr Brittin said there had been no co-ordination with the Treasury about the timing of Google's announcement about the tax settlement late last month. The Chancellor, George Osborne, described it as a victory for the government.
The timing was determined by the fact that the figure was due to be made public when the company's UK accounts were filed, Mr Brittin said.
Dame Lin told MPs that HMRC informed the relevant minister that a big company was to make a tax announcement the following day, but did not name the firm.
""What we don't, and never, do is share taxpayer information with ministers and Treasury colleagues,"" she said.
In a statement released after the hearing, Google said that it had 2,329 staff in the UK last year compared with 156 in 2005.
In an article for the Telegraph published on Thursday, Mr Brittin said Google wanted the international tax system to be reformed.
He said the company paid $3.3bn in corporation tax last year, mostly in the US, where most of Google's products were designed and created.
""We have long been in favour of simpler, clearer rules, because it is important not only to pay the right amount of tax, but to be seen to be paying the right amount,"" Mr Brittin wrote.
""But changes to the tax system are not Google's call. Reform must come from governments, not from the companies who are subject to their rules.""
He was asked four times by Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, how much he was paid. Mr Brittin said: ""I don't have the figure, but I will happily provide it.""
""You don't know what you get paid?"" responded Ms Hillier.
""Out there, taxpayers, our constituents, are very angry, they live in a different world clearly to the world you live in, if you can't even tell us what you are paid.""",Google's UK chief has defended the search giant's tax arrangements in a hearing before MPs on the Commons Public Accounts Committee.
"If all over-30s followed recommended guidelines on exercise, nearly 3,000 lives could be saved each year in Australia alone, say researchers.
More needs to be done to warn women of inactivity, as it outweighs other risk factors such as obesity, they say.
Lack of exercise is a known major risk factor for heart disease, says the British Heart Foundation.
A team at the University of Queensland, Australia tracked the health of more than 30,000 women born in the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.
They found smoking had the greatest impact on women's heart disease risk below the age of 30.
However, as women got older and more gave up smoking, it was overtaken by physical inactivity as the dominant influence on heart disease risk.
Continuing efforts to encourage people to stop smoking were warranted, the researchers reported in the British Journal of Sports Medicine.
But they said greater effort were needed to promote exercise, which they describe as a ""Cinderella"" risk factor compared with obesity.
""We need a lot more effort to keep middle-aged women active and then keep them active into old age,"" Prof Wendy Brown, of the university's centre for research on exercise, physical activity and health, told BBC News.
""If you can do at least 30 minutes and preferably 45 minutes a day, you'll see huge improvements in your health and reduce your risk of heart disease by half.""
According to NHS Choices, adults aged 19-64 years are recommended to do 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, or 30 minutes on five days a week.
Commenting on the study, Thembi Nkala, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said physical inactivity was a known major risk factor for heart disease.
""Interestingly, this study shows its dominant influence on heart disease amongst women, and suggests a greater need to promote regular physical activity amongst this group,"" she said.
""It's important to remember that heart disease is linked to other factors such as smoking, obesity, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.
""It's essential to manage these too, as the more risk factors you have, the greater your chance of heart disease. ""","Lack of exercise is the biggest risk factor for heart disease in women aged 30 and above, according to a study."
"Four charities withdrew as official partners from the Kiltwalk earlier this year and its chief executive stepped down a few weeks later.
The Kiltwalk stages sponsored walks across Scotland to raise money for leading children's charities.
Its 2013 accounts showed more was spent on costs than went to charity.
There is no suggestions regulations were broken.
Kiltwalk chairman Michael Ure said it had incurred additional costs because of a ""re-structuring"".
Mr Ure and the rest of the trustees have now stood down.
The Kiltwalk said a new board would oversee the continued development of the charity.
The group has also attracted support from one of Scotland's richest men, the entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, whose foundation has committed long-term funding.
Mr Hunter said: ""The Kiltwalk is a fantastic concept for raising much-needed funds for Scotland's children's charities and has our absolute support.
""We intend over the next couple of months to redefine and improve the model, building on the foundations already in place, to maximise returns for charities and turbo-charge Scotland's Kiltwalkers for 2016.""
The Kiltwalk was set up in 2011 with the aim of bringing Scotland's leading children's charities together for a series of sponsored walks.
It grew from 800 walkers that year to more than 12,000 across the country in 2014.
However, earlier this year four charities - CLIC Sargent, Cash for Kids, Aberlour and Edinburgh's Sick Kids Friends Foundation - withdrew as official partners.
CLIC Sargent and Aberlour indicated to BBC Scotland that they had concerns over the amount of money reaching them from the Kiltwalk.
The most recent set of accounts for the Kiltwalk showed that from an income of just over Â£1.6m, Â£780,000 had been spent on running costs - more than the Â£776,000 which went to charity.",A Scottish charity has replaced its entire board of trustees following concerns over the amount of money it was giving to charitable causes.

"The Pentagon chief also said Pyongyang would be ""grossly overmatched"" in a war against the US and its allies.
His stark warning comes a day after President Donald Trump threatened North Korea with ""fire and fury"".
US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson sought to assure Americans there was no imminent threat.
In Wednesday's strongly worded statement, Mr Mattis called on Pyongyang to halt its arms programme.
""The DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) must choose to stop isolating itself and stand down its pursuit of nuclear weapons,"" the US Marine Corps general said.
""While our state department is making every effort to resolve this global threat through diplomatic means, it must be noted that the combined allied militaries now possess the most precise, rehearsed and robust defensive and offensive capabilities on Earth.""
Pyongyang's actions ""will continue to be grossly overmatched by ours and would lose any arms race or conflict it initiates"", Mr Mattis added.
Mr Trump - who has said he will not allow Pyongyang to develop a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the US - boasted earlier on Wednesday of America's atomic arsenal.
In early morning tweets from New Jersey where he is on holiday, the president said the US nuclear stockpile was ""more powerful than ever before"".
He added that he was hopeful ""we will never have to use this power"".
End of Twitter post  by @realDonaldTrump
End of Twitter post 2 by @realDonaldTrump
The tweets come amid escalating rhetoric between the two sides.
North Korea's state-run KCNA news agency said on Wednesday that Pyongyang was ""carefully examining"" a plan to strike the US territory of Guam.
The Pacific island is home to US military bases, strategic bombers and about 163,000 people.
Stopping in Guam to refuel after a trip to South East Asia, Mr Tillerson said he was hopeful a global ""pressure campaign"" involving Russia and China could lead to new dialogue with Pyongyang ""about a different future"".
America's top diplomat also defended President Trump's language.
He said North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he could understand.
Mr Tillerson added the situation had not dramatically changed over the last few days, and that Americans ""should sleep well at night"".
China has urged calm, describing the situation as ""complex and sensitive"".
Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter
As Donald Trump made his ""fire and fury"" threat against North Korea, the lone camera in the room zoomed in for a tight shot. It would have been telling to see the effect those words had on his advisers.
Did they nod knowingly or look surprised? Was this part of the plan or an off-the-cuff presidential remark they'd have to clean up?
A day later and thousands of miles away, Rex Tillerson had out his mop and broom. The secretary of state said Mr Trump was merely reasserting that the US would defend itself if attacked, using language North Korea would understand.
That's not exactly what the president said, however. He warned of retribution if Kim Jong-un continued to make threats - punishing words with action.
It could simply be unfortunate phrasing from a man who is sometimes loose with words. Mr Tillerson would not be the first presidential aide intent on framing Mr Trump's blunt statements in a softer light.
With the president touting US nuclear might and test-firing an ICBM, however, the secretary of state - already considered to have little sway in this administration - may find his efforts at clarification buried in a torrent of bluster.
The White House on Wednesday denied reports that Mr Trump's ""fire and fury"" statement a day earlier, unusually provocative for a US president, was an off-the-cuff remark that had caught his inner circle unawares.
Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters: ""The tone and strength of the message were discussed beforehand.""
Despite rounds of UN sanctions, Pyongyang carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and two intercontinental ballistic missile tests in July.
On Tuesday, media reports in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.
However, most analysts doubt the tiny dictatorship would launch a suicidal pre-emptive attack on the US.

"And now an eight-year-old Swansea schoolboy is to quiz him about how it felt via Twitter.
Rhys Maguire-Stokes was among 25 pupils from Blaenymaes primary at a live link-up with the International Space Station on Tuesday.
It was one of 10 UK schools - and the only one from Wales - at the event in Liverpool.
While there was not time for Rhys to ask his question live, it has been tweeted to the astronaut to answer.
Class teacher Amy Smith said Rhys was chosen to be the school representative to ask Maj Tim as he floated 264 miles above Earth: ""How did it feel to walk in space?""
""It's a shame there wasn't time for him to ask his question live but we've tweeted Major Peake and will wait for his answer,"" she said.
""The kids have had a fabulous day and as soon as they saw Major Peake on the screen, their faces just lit up.""
Mrs Smith entered the school into a competition run by the Times Education Supplement's website to be one of those gathering at the World Museum, as part of the ""Cosmic Classroom"" event.
The feed was then relayed to other schools around the country; in all 10,000 children were taking part.
As well as answering pupils' questions, Maj Peake also demonstrated a number of scientific activities in space, which the children could copy in their classrooms.
""He was absolutely brilliant and did lots of tricks for them, showing how he floated and doing tricks with water to make it go into bubbles,"" said Mrs Smith, who took pupils from years 4 and 5.
""The children were very excited and have been since the moment they were told they were going.
""I think it's fantastic for him to take time out of his mission in space to talk to the children and he has really inspired them. A few of them are now saying they want to go into space too and be able to float.""
The children have been studying space as a topic since Christmas and will be holding a class assembly and creating a class book to mark their time with Maj Tim.

"The question: Jennie asks: ""Should we opt to leave the EU, would the duty on alcohol and cigarettes coming from Europe be reinstated?""
The answer: If the UK left the EU, the specific regulations for bringing goods from the EU to the UK would depend on the agreements reached in the exit negotiations, particularly with regards to the question of whether the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU.
Currently, there is no duty on goods you bring from the EU provided that they are for personal use, you transport them yourself, and you have paid duty tax in the country where you bought them. There are no limits to the alcohol and tobacco you can bring in from EU countries, but you may have to prove to custom officers that the products are for personal use if the quantities suggest that you may want to resell them.
You can also bring tobacco and alcohol (and other goods worth up to £390) to the UK from outside the EU without paying duty or tax, provided that the products are for personal use and that the quantities do not exceed the specified personal allowance. For goods that exceed the personal allowance and are worth up to £630, a custom duty of 2.5% applies. You may also have to pay import VAT on the total value of the goods plus duty at the standard UK VAT rates.

45% of all UK exports go to the EU
The question: Judi asks: ""A leaflet from the 'Stronger In' campaign states that the UK gets £66m of investment from EU countries thus creating lower prices in the shops. Are these true claims?""
The answer: This is based on the 2010 European Commission report ""Trade as a Driver of Prosperity"", which says that ""trade brings a wider variety of goods and services to consumers and to companies, at lower prices. Consumer benefits alone are estimated at 600 euro per year.""
The Britain Stronger in Europe campaign says 600 euro currently works out at £459 and they rounded it down to £450 per person.
The European Commission based its figure on a paper published in 2006 in the Quarterly Journal of Economics (QJE), Oxford University Press, which looked into the US market and concluded that the gains to US consumers of the growth in global variety during the period 1972-2001 was about 2.6% of GDP.
We asked the Commission to clarify how they'd got the figure for the EU. They replied: ""The Commission used the estimates done for the US market because no such estimates were readily available for the EU as a whole. However, since the EU and US levels of trade openness are similar, it is not unreasonable to approximate the magnitude of EU effects based on the US figures.""
We also asked the Commission whether they still stand by this figure (as it is based on a ten-year-old study which uses data from 1972 to 2001) and they replied: ""We consider this is still the most accurate estimate available for the EU as a whole.""
The question: Seb asks: ""Would we need new car number plates without the EU flag?""
The answer: There is no EU-wide law on vehicle registration and car number plates. Reports about EU plans to impose a standard design for vehicle registration plates have been dismissed by the European Commission.
The Commission website states that an EU regulation from 1998 established a model design to facilitate mutual recognition across member states. However, national governments are free to decide whether to adopt it or not.
In the UK, the EU symbol on the left hand side of the number plate is a voluntary identifier. Although official statistics on the number of vehicle registration plates displaying this EU identifier in the UK have not been compiled, this means that many British number plates would not be affected by the outcome of the EU referendum.
The British Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency informed the BBC that there has been no discussion about what would happen to those number plates that currently do include the European identifier, should Britain decide to leave the EU.
The question: Martin asks: ""If we leave, can we have incandescent light bulbs back?""
The answer: That depends on whether we want them back. In theory, if we leave the EU then that sort of legislation on environmental issues would come back to the Westminster Parliament. In practice, it is unlikely that incandescent light bulbs would be brought back. They have long been a target for green campaigners, concerned about climate change. Production of 60 and 100-watt bulbs has been phased out in Europe but you can still use them if you have a stock.
The presumption is that, if the UK decides to leave the EU, all the existing rules would be in place while the UK and the EU negotiate a deal.  For example, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are fully integrated in the EU Single Market but are not members of the EU. This means they have to comply with EU regulations. You can find out more about the particular trade deals the UK might have to negotiate in the event of a British exit from the EU here.
Some trade regulation sets minimum requirements for how energy efficient common household items, like kettles and vacuum cleaners, should be. As we've outlined here, there are currently no plans to regulate British kettles, though they are being reviewed under an EU directive. Another EU regulation will abolish roaming charges in EU member states from 2017, though we can't say for sure whether this would affect British consumers if the UK voted to leave the EU. You can find more about that here.

"Steven Knowles' tweets were described by a hearing as ""threatening"" and ""extremely offensive"".
The Health and Care Professions Council heard in December 2014 and January 2015 he also called Mr Hunt a murderer and wished health problems on his family.
Mr Knowles said the issue had meant he could not find work in the NHS.
The panel heard Mr Knowles sent six messages while working as a operating department practitioner at Sherwood Forest Hospitals, Nottinghamshire.
Before the decision Mr Knowles told the panel he had devoted 30 years to his job and wanted to go back to providing a valuable service.
But the panel criticised his behaviour, finding he ""lacked a full appreciation of the wider impact of these threatening tweets on his intended target, his colleagues and members of the public, or the wider effect of such misconduct on public confidence in the profession"".
Mr Knowles said he would not appeal against the decision.","An NHS employee who tweeted ""I would gladly blow your brains out"" to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has been suspended for 13 months."
"Joe Cardle slotted in his eighth of the season before setting up Kallum Higginbotham to extend the Pars' lead.
Dumbarton's Craig Barr hit the crossbar with a second-half header but the Sons then had Andy Dowie sent off for two bookings.
Substitutes Nicky Clark and Andy Ryan added late goals to add gloss to the visitors' victory.
That is four wins on the bounce for Allan Johnston's men and on this form Dunfermline appear to be more than capable of sustaining a promotion challenge.
Of the six players playing in midfield or attack, only Nate Wedderburn really sits back. That security allowed Cardle, Higginbotham, Declan McManus, Dean Shiels and Callum Smith to roam forward in the first half.
Cardle converted at the back post after a messy scramble following good initial play down the right by McManus.
A superb counter-attack brought the Pars their second, as Higginbotham rolled the ball calmly into the far corner from a fairly tight angle.
Dumbarton nearly reduced the deficit, but Barr's header bounced off the woodwork after he had connected with Tom Walsh's corner.
The Sons also felt aggrieved not to be given a penalty when Ally Roy appeared to be clipped just inside the box.
Dowie was given his marching orders with 15 minutes to go, before Clark made his comeback from an ankle injury to head in David Hopkirk's cross.
Clark then back-heeled to tee up another substitute Ryan for a well-executed, low curled shot into the far left corner.
Dunfermline manager Allan Johnston: ""I'm happy but I'm realistic as well because we know it's only the start of the season. We've started really strongly, we've got a really good, competitive squad and we've got people that can score goals.
""We're defending really well as well, so it's a good balance to have. We've just to make sure we keep up that kind of performance.
""I don't think we lacked confidence last season, it was a step up and it took us a bit of time to get in our stride. It's about consistency and coming to places like Dumbarton and winning. We can't take our foot off the gas.""
Dumbarton manager Stevie Aitken: ""We gave Dunfermline a two-goal start and you can't do that with a team of the quality of Dunfermline. There was indecision by the goalkeeper in the first one, then we gave the ball away cheaply for the second.
""Second half there was plenty of endeavour and we hit the crossbar, but it was a disappointing day.
""Danny Handling has come in and has this problem with his knee we weren't aware of. We don't know what's wrong with it, but we can't go into a game having to take a player off after 10 minutes because of a knee injury - so we'll have to get that looked at.""

"The wall at Oxgangs Primary collapsed during stormy weather in January 2016.
A senior employee at the subcontractor that built it, VB Contracts, told the BBC the inner and outer walls were not constructed at the same time.
Architecture professor Alan Dunlop said this ""design issue"" could have been the root of the problem at Oxgangs.
VB Contracts went bust in 2010, but the BBC spoke to a former employee, who did not want to be identified, as part of the BBC Scotland Investigates: How Safe is My School? programme, which was broadcast on Monday evening.
The collapse of the Oxgangs wall led to 17 schools across Edinburgh being closed over safety concerns. They have all since reopened.
The schools had all been built or refurbished following a Â£360m deal between the city council and a private finance consortium under the Public Private Partnership 1 (PPP1) scheme.
The lead contractor for the Edinburgh schools project, Miller Construction, was bought by Galliford Try in 2014.
Miller Construction had outsourced some of the work to VB Contracts, which was responsible for the brick and blockworks at Oxgangs Primary, and built the wall that collapsed.
Internal blockworks for such walls are generally built at the same time as the brick which forms the outside skin of the building.
This allows the builder to ensure the two parts are properly connected, with wall ties in the right places.
But the former employee said Miller Construction had told VB Contracts to build the internal wall at Oxgangs first so the building could be made water and wind tight as quickly as possible in order to allow inside work such as plastering to get started.
It was the outer wall that subsequently fell down at Oxgangs school.
Architect Alan Dunlop told the BBC the way the walls were built was therefore not ""standard practice"" and in his view was at the ""root of the problems"" at Oxgangs school.
He said: ""If you're going to do that, I would expect a method statement for that to be done. That's a design issue. It's not an add, it's not something you do ad hoc. And you have to do it properly and you have to specify the right wall ties for doing it.
""In the evidence of the photographs that we have seen, that doesn't look to be the proper wall tie that you would actually use in circumstances like that.""
Mr Dunlop added: ""The evidence is clear in the Oxgangs project. The wall collapsed and evidently it doesn't look as though it was safe at all. That's another whole shocking and worrying aspect of this whole process.""
In a statement, Galliford Try said it had contractual responsibility for four of the 17 Edinburgh public private partnership schools built 10 years ago.
The statement added: ""Work required to reopen those four schools temporarily closed has been completed and the schools opened on 24 May and 6 June 2016.
""Throughout, Galliford Try's priority has been to ensure the children return to their studies at the earliest opportunity. We worked tirelessly with the City of Edinburgh Council and Edinburgh Schools Partnership in order to achieve this.""
An independent inquiry into the school closures matter will consider whether the private finance method used to construct them contributed to the structural issues with the buildings.
The City of Edinburgh Council said the schools would be safe and well-maintained for as long as the contract is in place.","The collapse of a wall at an Edinburgh primary school could have been caused by the way it was built, a BBC Scotland investigation has found."

"It has already reduced administrative staff from 23 to 18 and employs 63 musicians.
The orchestra said it is negotiating with musicians to get rid of what it calls ""restrictive practices"".
The orchestra assured MLAs it is trying to become less Belfast-centred.
Sir George Bain, the executive chairman, told the committee it could send smaller groups of musicians out to towns that could not accommodate the full orchestra.
He also added that musicians were paid full salaries even when not giving performances, but their contracts mean they could not be used for other projects, without extra payment.
Earlier this month, Sir George revealed the orchestra would be forced to close by the end of the year unless it received £500,000 in emergency funding.
Sir George Bain's warning came as he revealed the details behind a rescue plea to Belfast City Council that could mean a name change for the orchestra.
It costs about £4.5m a year to run the Ulster Orchestra.
It said it had lost 28% of funding from public sources - the equivalent of £1m - in the past four years.
In a bid to survive, it has asked Belfast City Council to back a rescue plan that includes a £500,000 funding guarantee to keep it solvent until March next year when it would be restructured.
It is also asking for the free use for the next five years of the Ulster Hall, which costs about £160,000 a year.
According to Sir George, the orchestra could end up changing its name to something like the Belfast Symphony if the rescue plan was accepted.
If the money is not forthcoming, the orchestra is warning it could go into administration before Christmas and close not long afterwards.
It is the only full-time professional orchestra in Northern Ireland, and plays the majority of its concerts in Belfast's Ulster Hall and the Waterfront Hall.
The BBC gives financial support of £639,000 a year to the orchestra.
Belfast City Council has yet to respond to the orchestra's request for additional funding.","The Ulster Orchestra has told Stormont's culture committee it cannot cut more staff to save money, while it tackles a £500,000 gap in funding."

"After leaking information about the National Security Agency's surveillance programme to the Guardian newspaper, he said he chose Hong Kong because the city has ""a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent"".
Mr Snowden's current whereabouts cannot be confirmed. He left the hotel he had been staying in shortly after going public.
The Hong Kong government has promised to handle any extradition request from the US according to established law and policy.
Hong Kong signed an extradition treaty with the US shortly before the territory returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
""You get extraditions several times a year from Hong Kong,"" Clive Grossman S.C, a barrister and former vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association, told the BBC.
Under the Fugitive Offenders (United States of America) Order, both Hong Kong and the US have agreed to extradite someone who has committed ""an offence which is punishable under the laws of both Parties by imprisonment or other form of detention for more than one year... unless surrender for such offence is prohibited by the laws of the requested Party.""
Regina Ip, a legislator and Hong Kong's former Secretary for Security, told reporters in May that the Hong Kong government was ""obliged to comply with the terms of agreements"" with the US government, including extradition treaties.
""It's actually in his best interest to leave Hong Kong,"" she said, referring to Mr Snowden.
However, the extradition process can be a long and complicated one in sensitive cases like this, Tim Parker, an immigration lawyer based in Hong Kong, has told the BBC.
""There are a number of hurdles that could come up for the extraditing authority, to the advantage of Snowden,"" he said.
""There is a bar under Hong Kong's extradition law... to extradition for an offence that is of a political character, [where] the prosecution is thought not just to be the application of the criminal law, but to crush that person or to crush their dissent,"" Mr Parker said.
Another potential hurdle would be any intervention from Beijing, which could block an extradition if it raised questions ""going to their national security, foreign affairs, or defence"", Mr Parker says.
A handover could also be halted if Mr Snowden was believed to be in danger of receiving inhumane treatment in the US, Mr Parker added.
""If Mr Snowden is at risk of being detained under the sort of conditions that Bradley Manning has reportedly been detained, which the UN special rapporteurs have said amounted to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment... then Hong Kong would not be allowed under its law, and could not extradite him to the US.""
A further consideration is what visa Mr Snowden used to enter Hong Kong. If his visa is due to expire soon, a formal extradition request may not be needed.
However, it would not be ""legally possible"" under Hong Kong law for Mr Snowden to be forcibly taken to Beijing, Mr Parker says.
""That would be a serious breach of the autonomy under Hong Kong's One Country Two Systems arrangement. There aren't really any known cases of that having been done off the books [either],"" he says.","Edward Snowden, who has been charged with espionage by US over leaks about US surveillance programmes, is thought to have been in Hong Kong since 20 May."

"However, when you're at the very top of an organisation and juggling multiple demands it's even tougher.
To drive their organisations to success, chief executives need to be crystal clear about their goals.
They also need to not get distracted when carrying them out.
The key to keeping on top of your workload and not getting overwhelmed includes:
Delegating work, keeping meetings fairly short and working intensely in only short bursts.
You should also remember to stay focussed, and keep a decent work-life balance otherwise you will risk burning out.
Here some of the world's top business leaders share their secrets to not getting bogged down by the details.
""You really have to evolve into a headset where you're only going to hold yourself accountable for the things you can control. If you bear every burden of the world, you're going to die a young death as a CEO.
""If you're going to say, 'Oh my god, what am I going to do about the French economy? It's so terrible right now' - you can't do a damn thing about that and you can't worry about that. You just have to hold yourself accountable for those things you personally can have an impact on and leave the rest behind.""
""I think you can either delegate or you can't, and my whole modus operandi is to get it off my desk as quickly as possible onto someone else's desk.
""It's a really good policy. I recommend it to any chief executives. Just get rid of the email onto someone else if you can.""
""It's managing your time and making sure you have energy left over. It's very hard to travel halfway around the world and land and visit 10 hotels and sit across the table from owners and make sure that you're sharp the whole time. Taking care of yourself and pacing yourself is actually important.
""I'm not terribly good at saying no. If someone feels like I can help them somewhere, my first bias is to try to get there to do that, and there are just points where you have to say if I try to do too much, I'm not going to be good at what I need to do.""
""We can only can function at an optimum level for about 90 minutes. In other words we can do intense work for about 90 minutes and then we need to do something else.
""And if you try to keep focusing you'll notice there's some long meetings, people begin to wander, their attention can't be focused and you get to this real point of diminishing returns.
""You'll find you can do your best work in these sort of short bursts and you have creative 'oh my gosh' epiphanies and things are coming and you get it down. But then you've got to go renew yourself.""
""The most important thing in life is to have a balance. Just being a CEO and just constantly being under pressure and working and driving yourself, at the end of the day you'll be no good to anyone. You'll burn out and you'll burn out quickly.
""The Chinese have a saying. They say 'yin yang'. It's a balance. Everything in life is a balance. So you have to balance your life. It'll make you stronger in the things you do, it'll make you better at what you do.

"The Juno spacecraft passed over the giant storm on Monday as it continued with its series of close passes of the gaseous world.
The pictures of the spot reveal the intricate nature of its swirls which encompass a region bigger than Earth.
Juno's instruments all acquired data during the pass which should now provide fresh insight on the storm.
It has been a particularly long-lived feature on Jupiter, but there is evidence that the 16,350-km-wide oval has actually been shrinking of late.
""For hundreds of years scientists have been observing, wondering and theorising about Jupiter's Great Red Spot,""  Scott Bolton, Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, said in a Nasa statement.
""Now we have the best pictures ever of this iconic storm. It will take us some time to analyse all the data from not only JunoCam, but Juno’s eight science instruments, to shed some new light on the past, present and future of the Great Red Spot.""
Scientists describe the storm as something similar to a hurricane - but there are significant differences between that kind of storm on Earth and what we see at Jupiter. Many behaviours are not the same.
For example, hurricanes on Earth quickly lose energy when they leave the ocean surface and pass over land - but on Jupiter, there is no land. Indeed, researchers are not even sure there exists any kind of hard surface under the planet's clouds.
This could be an explanation for why the spot has persisted for centuries. But Juno hopes to resolve such puzzles.
It has the instrumentation to determine the precise chemical composition of the oval's clouds, to sense their temperature and structure, and to measure how deep they go. There is a suspicion that the spot has very deep roots.
Jonathan Nichols, a British science team-member from the University of Leicester, marvelled at the new pictures.
""These images are stunning, and reveal Jupiter's Great Red Spot in all its glory,"" he told BBC News.
""From the three swirls inside the deep red core to the waves and vortices orbiting it, the images reveal the power and chaos of this iconic storm.
""The light and dark shades reveal the wind flow in the spot and potentially the 3D structure of the cloud decks.  But the images are also a perfect convergence of science and art, revealing the awesome beauty of the giant planet.
""The quality of these data are superb, and it bodes well for further Juno data that will reveal how deep into the atmosphere the Great Red Spot extends.""
Juno has been at Jupiter for just over a year. It flies large ellipses around the planet, coming in close every 53 days.
Monday’s pass saw it skim just 3,500km above the cloudtops at one point. When it travelled across the spot, it was still a mere 9,000km overhead.
The practice of the mission so far has been to release raw images from JunoCam and invite the public to work on them - to process them in ways that highlight areas of scientific interest, or simply to make some fascinating artwork.
Meanwhile, the science team gets to work on the data-sets from the other instruments. Their findings take a while longer to emerge - at conferences and in journal papers.

"Longford in Hillingdon could be demolished if a third runway is built at neighbouring Heathrow Airport.
A hotel is providing accommodation in houses it has bought for asylum seekers, including those from the so-called ""Jungle"" in Calais.
The Home Office said it has tried to address residents' concerns.
It has said decisions about the use of hotel accommodation, including which premises are used, are a matter for the contractors who bear the cost.
It would not say how many asylum seekers were being sent to Longford, but said rooms were used for one or two days before asylum seekers were dispersed into temporary accommodation.
BBC London filmed two coaches and three van loads arriving in one day carrying people from Iran, Sudan, Eritrea and Syria.
Many of those on board said they had come from the so-called ""Jungle"".
Three days later, another two coaches were witnessed arriving.
Ray, 85, has lived in Longford for 50 years. He said asylum seekers were accommodated in the houses either side of his.
""They meet and they have conversations in the middle of my front garden,"" he said.
""We don't know where they come from, we don't know what they are and we are living next door to them, albeit they might be very nice people.""
The hotel, Heathrow Lodge, also rents rooms to travellers using the airport.
Booking websites confirm a room can cost Â£30 a night per person, less per person if sharing.
Neither the Home Office nor the hotel would say how much is paid per asylum seeker.
BBC London booked a room and met eight men all staying in one house.
They were asylum seekers from Sudan and Eritrea and said a few days earlier they had been sleeping rough in the camp in Calais.
Mogdad from Sudan said he had paid a people trafficker 500 euros (Â£370) in Calais to get to the UK.
""I have no choice,"" he said. ""I have to get away from death.""
Villager Ray said: ""The coaches turn up  - about 20, 30 people get off, and they're transferred to all the houses that are around the village.""
Longford resident Leon, said: ""You know, (with) what's going on around the world at the moment, they've got a right to move from dangerous areas, but it's just saturated where I live, with immigrants.
""I chose to live here with the aeroplanes, but I didn't choose to live here with the three to four coaches a day moving in and out, and especially at night-time as well.

""I am going to move from here, as soon as.
""It was good before the immigrants came.""
While the future of the village may be bound by the government's decision over whether to build a new runway at Heathrow, residents say they want something done.
The Home Office said it had been made clear to contractors that the use of hotels was only ever acceptable as a short-term contingency measure.
Hillingdon Council said it received three complaints earlier this year, adding it had looked into claims rooms were being overcrowded and had put in additional licensing arrangements for the hotel.

"But there are still many real problems and concerns for Rio 2016 organisers with two weeks before the opening ceremony in the Maracana Stadium.
The biggest of those worries is the return of violence and crime to the streets of the so-called ""Marvellous City"" after years of steady progress in a positive direction.
The worrying reverse is most notable in the favelas, or shantytowns, that skirt Rio's more affluent south zone.
What has gone wrong in Brazil?
In favelas like Santa Marta, Pavaozinho and Babilonia the much-heralded Police Pacification projects (UPP) have stalled, drugs gangs have moved back in and people are again being killed.
Babilonia is one notable case because the favela overlooks the tourist beaches of Leme and Copacabana, where Olympic events including beach volleyball and the triathlon will take place.
Until recently it was regarded as one of the safest and coolest destinations in the city; with hillside bars overlooking the beach offering the best seafood and beer in town to visitors and steady employment for locals.
But as Lieutenant Carlos Veiga leads us on a patrol through the favela's steep, narrow alleyways, he tells me how things have deteriorated badly in recent months.
""It's dangerous, particularly at night and the gangs often shoot at our patrols,"" says the UPP commander here.
Bodies have been found in the nearby mata, or forest - the result of clashes between the two drugs gangs vying for control of the favela complex.
Locals who have enjoyed and benefited from the relative calm of recent years echo each other's concerns about a return of violence and many residents worry that after the Olympic Games the financially-broke state government will cut the pacification programme, abandoning the favelas to their fate.
If the situation is bleak in the smaller favelas like Babilonia, it can sometimes seem like all-out war in the bigger conurbations of Complexo do Alemao and Mare.
There are shootings on a daily basis, bringing a halt to traffic on the main road between the airport and the city. An eye-watering number of people - almost 2,000 - have been murdered in Rio this year already.
Many victims of violence are killed by police, either in crossfire or shot dead by a military police force which is accused of being trigger happy and too eager to execute suspected criminals rather than arrest them.
But the police are victims of violence too.
""Welcome to Hell"" was the slogan that greeted arriving travellers at Rio's international airport recently. The protestors were policemen, complaining about unpaid salaries and the deaths of colleagues in the city's brutal drugs wars.
""There have been more than 50 policemen and women killed this year - another one this week,"" says Carlos Braga.
The recently retired civil police inspector added: ""I am not safe. I cannot even guarantee my own safety. We police officers have to hide our badges and our guns. There will be a big amount of foreigners here yet the government can't even pay the police to protect them!""
After the city's high profile and sometimes outspoken Mayor Eduardo Paes, Rio's best known and most influential political figure is arguably Jose Mariano Beltrame.
He is the secretary of security for the state of Rio, not the city - a distinction that matters because Mr Paes recently blamed the state administration for ""making a terrible mess"" of the security situation.
Mr Beltrame bites his tongue when asked to respond to the mayor's accusations and is fiercely defensive of his forces' record when I ask about accusations of extrajudicial killings; but he does not hide the reality that he faces a serious financial and operational crisis.
""Imagine if I come to you and say that you will receive only half your salary and then ask you to go out, to risk your life every day,"" says Mr Beltrame, who recently went out on a limb to appeal for more funds to pay for police wages.
The chief, who also suggested that the system was on the brink of collapse, says his biggest headache now, is not crime or violence but ""terrorism"".
There has not been a major international terror attack in South America since the bombing of a Jewish cultural centre in Buenos Aires 22 years ago, in which 85 people were killed.
There will be an extra 80,000 armed security personnel - a mix of soldiers and military police - on the streets of Rio and at every Olympic installation which Mr Beltrame and other officials insist will keep visitors, residents and competitors safe.
But there are worrying ""gaps"" everywhere.
Several troops who have come from outside the city to protect Rio have reportedly threatened to quit over appalling living conditions and unpaid salaries.
Other reports detail the last minute awarding of key security contracts to companies with little experience in the field and, as Mr Beltrame acknowledged, this is a country with 10,000 miles (16,000 km) of often porous land borders which would, theoretically, make Brazil a ""soft target"" for anyone seeking to disrupt the Games.
The BBC recently saw evidence demonstrating just how easy it would be to infiltrate the country after the federal police intercepted a gang that had provided more than 70 genuine Brazilian passports to Syrian nationals via corrupt officials.
Nonetheless despite largely anecdotal evidence, there is no concrete proof or threat of attack during the Olympics and the advice is that people should not be unduly worried.
Rio de Janeiro is still one of the world's most beguiling cities and will provide a stunning backdrop for the Olympics, but it has an ominously dark side too.","The spectre of an Olympic Games plagued by the Zika virus may be waning, as the cold spell sweeping through southern Brazil deals with disease-carrying mosquitoes more effectively than any repellent."

She said the button-shaped batteries ""look like sweets"" to children but can cause severe internal bleeding which medics struggle to treat.
Lithium batteries are found in items such as toys, keys and smartphones.
Dr Parkins, a lead consultant for the region's Paediatric Intensive Care Transport Service, is calling for a national campaign to highlight the dangers.
""They look innocent enough and therefore nobody thinks to put them out of reach from children,"" she said.
One child died in May last year after a battery got lodged in the upper part of the feeding tube, she said.
""It had been removed and then, about a week later, caused catastrophic bleeding which we couldn't control.""
The most serious cases are associated with Lithium button batteries larger than 20mm (the size of a 10 pence piece) which can cause severe injury within two hours.
And they do not have to be damaged, crushed or chewed to cause serious harm.

""That causes a burn through the oesophagus, the feeding tube, and that can then burn through into major blood vessels and that's why the bleeding is then pretty much impossible to control and stop.""
The consultant at Central Manchester University Hospital Trust also wants to raise medical awareness ""because a lot of doctors are unaware that this can cause harm either"".
Dr Parkins said in the second fatal case, medics did not know if the three-year-old had swallowed a button battery.
""She suffered catastrophic bleeding which again with all medical intervention we couldn't control.
""She died because of severe haemorrhaging, severe blood loss.""
Children who have survived have been left with ""severe life-changing injuries"", she said.
""Two deaths is too many as far as we're concerned. Two or three patients having severe injuries is too many when it's something potentially preventable.""

"The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said there were ""major issues"" in the way allergies were recorded and shared.
In its first guidelines on allergy, it is calling for known allergies to be recorded on all prescriptions.
The charity Allergy UK said a ""lack of awareness"" was putting lives at risk.
Official data recorded 18,079 incidents of drug allergies affecting patient safety in the NHS in England and Wales between 2005 and 2013.
Most involved medicines which were prescribed to a patient with a known allergy to that class of drugs.
Prof Mark Baker, the director of the centre for clinical practice at NICE, said: ""If we know that giving someone a particular drug could cause them harm, or in the worst instances may even kill them, the utmost care must be taken to ensure they are not prescribed or administered that drug.""
NICE said efforts were needed to ""dispel confusion"" over allergies after ""major issues"" were discovered as the guidelines were drawn up.
It called for improvements in the way doctors collect information on patients' allergies. It also wants a re-design of all prescriptions to include information on the classes of drugs to which a patient is known to be allergic.
Signs of allergy include fever, hives, wheezing, redness and swelling.
Dr Shuaib Nasser, a consultant allergist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, stated: ""The guideline stresses the care all healthcare professionals must take when documenting new drug allergies and the importance of sharing this information with patients and other healthcare professionals.
""People should be provided with structured written information on drugs to avoid and be advised to check with their pharmacist before taking over-the-counter medicines.
""In some cases, specialist investigations will be required to confirm or exclude drug allergy.""
Maureen Jenkins, clinical director at the charity Allergy UK, said: ""Drug allergies can cause severe, sometimes life-threatening reactions but are often undiagnosed.
""We frequently have calls about the lack of awareness about drug allergy, inadequate documentation and communication between health professionals, which can put patients' lives at risk. We welcome these NICE guidelines, that will lay the foundation stone for better understanding and management of drug allergy across primary, secondary and tertiary care.""","Thousands of lives are put at risk by doctors prescribing drugs to which patients are known to be allergic, the medicines watchdog says."
"Muslim Youth Focus Group organised the event to voice concerns about issues such as radicalisation.
The event was held as it emerged four teenage girls who were barred from travelling abroad were from the same school attended by three girls already thought to have fled to Syria.
All seven attend Bethnal Green Academy in Tower Hamlets.
The name of the school was revealed after reporters argued it was in the public interest.
The event was aimed at young British Muslims to help create a platform for them to discuss issues such as Islamophobia, Islamic State and the war in Syria.
In mid-February, police raised concerns following the disappearance of Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, from their homes in east London.
Shamima used the passport of her 17-year-old sister to leave the UK, police have said.
Young people, police, teachers, faith leaders and Muslims from the world of entertainment gathered at the Muslim Youth Festival to explore views on what it means to be a Muslim today.
Role models spoke at the event including music star Naughty Boy, whose real name is Shahid Khan, and has been working with Zayn Malik, who recently announced he was leaving One Direction.
Imam, Dr Mohammed Fahim of South Woodford Mosque said: ""Young British Muslims, irrespective of their ethnicities or gender, should feel proud to live in a country like Britain which respects human rights and gives them equal opportunities and permits them to practice their religion without any fear or oppression.""",Hundreds of young British Muslims have attended a festival in London on how to divert people away from extremism.

But the contrast could not be more different in India where consumers are being bombarded with low-priced smart devices.
These cheaper handsets are set to open up new online opportunities, as millions of people take to the internet for the first time.  From Delhi, David Reid reports.
Watch more reports on Asia Business Report's website.",Smartphones were one of the big themes of the week  - and the release of Apple's latest iPhone could well shake things up at the top end of the market.
"They include forcing transparency standards on UK overseas territories and a register of offshore trusts.
The party has called for a public inquiry into alleged abuses uncovered in leaked documents from a Panama law firm - and vowed not to accept donations linked to tax avoidance.
The government has set up a task force to look into the Panama Papers.
And the prime minister has taken the unprecedented step of publishing details of his tax and income over the past six years following Labour claims he had misled the public over whether he had benefitted from an offshore fund.
David Cameron will also host an international anti-corruption summit in London next month - and the government is to publish a register of beneficial ownership, revealing who ultimately gains from shadowy shell companies used to avoid tax.
But Labour argue Mr Cameron should publish his full tax returns and say the government's £10m task force must be ""fully independent and in public"".
Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""After a week of half-truths and spin from this government in the wake of the revelations in the Panama Papers leak, it's time to clean out the tax havens with real government action.
""It should be a matter of shame to the British government that more than half the companies recently named in the Panama Papers were registered in UK-governed tax havens.
""Not only has this government impeded international efforts to crack down on tax avoidance and to tackle tax havens but senior figures are personally implicated in these immoral schemes.""
Other measures in Labour's ""tax transparency"" plan include:
Labour also questioned a letter Mr Cameron wrote to EU officials in 2013, which called for offshore trusts to be excluded from a crackdown on tax avoidance.
The government said Mr Cameron had felt forcing trusts to reveal who gained financially from them would ""distract"" from action in more pressing areas.
But Mr McDonnell said:  ""It is deeply concerning that our prime minister has still failed to clarify whether or not he or his family were benefiting directly or indirectly in 2013 when he was lobbying to prevent EU measures to better regulate trusts as a way to clamp down on tax avoidance.""
The shadow chancellor also promised that Labour would reject any donations linked to tax avoidance.
Political donations made by individuals are not tax-deductible in the UK - but money left in wills to major parties is not subject to inheritance tax.
Labour accepted a £1.65m donation in shares in 2013, from home shopping magnate John Mills, which he said at the time was a more ""tax efficient"" way of donating to the party than giving cash.
Quizzed about the Mills donation on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr McDonnell said: ""Every penny that comes in to us will open and transparent.
""We will not be touching money that is used by any way in measures to avoid tax or evade tax, we will not allow that to happen and we're not allowing that to happen.""
Mr McDonnell and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have also suggested that the inheritance tax system is in need of reform to make it ""fairer"".
Mr McDonnell told Pienaar's Politics: ""I don't personalise politics, this is about the system, and a system whereby someone can inherit, effectively, £500,000 from his mum and dad and not pay a penny on it, I think there's something wrong in the system that allows that to happen.""
But Housing minister Brandon Lewis pointed out that the gift from Mrs Cameron to her son was no different from similar arrangements used in other families, it was just a ""larger sum of money"".
Jeremy Corbyn has previously suggested the current 40% inheritance tax rate, which kicks in at £135,000, should be ""graded"" so the wealthiest families pay more.","Labour has set out a series of measures it claims will ""stop the super-rich hiding their wealth"" in tax havens."

Irishwoman Taylor, bidding to win a sixth consecutive World title, lost a split decision against France's Estelle Mossely in Kazakhstan.
Taylor, 29, was given all four rounds by one judge but the other two judges handed Mossely a countback victory.
The Bray fighter takes bronze but does secure Rio Olympics qualification.
Taylor's domination of the 60kg division was dented last month by a unanimous points defeat by  Azerbaijan's Yana Alekseevna at the Olympic qualifying tournament in Turkey.
The Irish boxer hadn't lost a fight at the world championships since 2005 when she was defeated by North Korea's Kang Kum-Hui in the quarter-finals.
The judging appeared decidedly confusing during Thursday's contest with Taylor given the third round on all three cards despite the Frenchwoman appearing to dominate the round.
Taylor then appeared to edge the final round only for two of the judges to plump for Mossely.
That left Taylor a 40-36 winner on one of the cards while the two judges that marked the contest 38-38 gave Mossely a countback victory.

"A draft, submitted last week, sparked controversy over a clause that allows immunity for the generals who seized power in May last year.
Also causing concern is a clause which would allow unelected individuals to be appointed prime minister.
Thailand has seen almost a decade of divisive political conflict.
The previous constitution was abolished by the military after the coup. The current government operates under a temporary charter.
""We have drafted this constitution as it is a reform one, in hopes of leading the country out of cycles of conflicts, disunity and undemocratic fights,"" Gen Lertrat Ratanavanich, a spokesman for the Constitution Drafting Committee, told the AP news agency.
""I'm confident this constitution will provide justice to every side [of the conflict], more than the previous charters.""
Under the new draft, future elections will be decided by a proportional representation system that leans towards smaller parties and coalition governments.
The upper house will mostly be unelected members; and the charter will allow parliament to choose as prime minister someone who is not a politician or an MP.
The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says the probable outcome of the new constitution will be weak and short-lived coalition governments, which would leave more power in the hands of the military and of senior, largely royalist bureaucrats, many of whom supported the coup.
The constitutional draft will be debated for six days, our correspondent adds, after which there will be very few opportunities for public discussion.
The military has ruled out a referendum but plans instead to seek opinion from a thousand selected respondents in each of Thailand's 77 provinces.
Critics say the constitution is aimed at preventing the return of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
He was ousted in 2006, after being accused of corruption and now lives in self-imposed exile.
Since then, Thailand has been deeply divided as his supporters and opponents struggle for political control, with the conflict sometimes spilling over into street violence.","Thailand's military-picked reform council has begun a week-long debate over a new constitution, almost a year after a military coup."
"One of the victims, as well as sources quoted in a UN report, all accuse Lt Col Kibibi Mutware of links to New Year's Day rapes in the town of Fizi.
There have been numerous cases of mass rape in DR Congo's conflict but this is believed to be the largest single incident allegedly involving the army.
Lt Col Kibibi has denied the charges.
He said that the soldiers who raided the town had disobeyed orders.
From an everyday fight between two men over a woman, violence escalated into a brutal punitive expedition by a group of government troops against the population of Fizi.
""A soldier was killed here right beside the hospital,"" explains Dr Faise Chacha, the head of Fizi hospital.
""That started the panic and all our patients fled. We came back at 0500 the next morning and we started taking in people who had been stabbed and others - women - who had been raped.""
Dr Chacha and the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres have treated 51 rape victims so far, but they expect more as women who fled the attacks slowly return home.
As in previous cases of rape in DR Congo, many victims are expected to keep their plight secret to avoid being abandoned by their husbands and families.
Two of them agreed to talk anonymously after medics told the BBC they had been raped.
""I was raped in front of my four children,"" one of them told the BBC.
""I'm ashamed, very ashamed. If I meet two or three people who are having a discussion, I assume they are talking about me, even though it is not the case.""
The other woman was able to identify her attackers.
""It was 1900 [in the evening] and those who raped me were members of the military,"" she said in a low voice, her body wrapped in a colourful cloth.
""There were four of them - Kibibi and his bodyguards. They stole all our belongings and our money.""
This woman was not the only one accusing Lt Col Kibibi, current commander of the 43rd sector in the army's Amani Leo (Peace Today) operation against rebel groups which still roam eastern DR Congo eight years after the country's war officially ended.
Several people who live near the hospital said they saw him ordering his troops to attack the population to avenge their dead comrade.
An internal report by investigators sent to Fizi by the UN peacekeeping mission Monusco and seen by the BBC also quotes local leaders and police sources who accuse Lt Col Kibibi of directing the atrocity.
Monusco sent patrols from the day after the violence from its Baraka base, just over one hour's drive away, and has maintained a 24-hour presence in Fizi since 5 January, which has encouraged the population to come back.
Lt Col Kibibi is a strong man with a small moustache and a boonie hat. When I met him, he was sitting behind a table on which only two mobile phones and one walkie-talkie were visible.
Speaking in the thatched hut from which he commands his troops, he dismissed all accusations levelled against him as rumours and said that those soldiers who committed the crimes had disobeyed his orders to stay in the camp.
He added that he only left his base briefly on 1 January to assess the death of the lynched soldier, and only heard about the night's violence the next morning.
Lt Col Vianney Kazarama, the army spokesman for operations in South Kivu province, acknowledged that government soldiers were responsible for the Fizi attack but he promised swift legal action.
""All those people who have abused the population have already been arrested. The zero-tolerance policy will be enforced on the spot in Fizi,"" he told the BBC.
In a statement, the UN's special representative on sexual violence, Margot Wallstrom, called on the Congolese authorities to conduct an investigation ""thoroughly and without delay"".
""Impunity for these types of crimes must not be tolerated,"" she added.
Lt Col Kibibi is a former member of the CNDP rebel group, which has previously been accused of numerous human rights abuses.
He was integrated into the national army as part of a peace agreement in 2009.
According to a local military source, his unit is a mixture of former militias based on Rwandan-speaking ethnic groups.
Those troops were deployed to Fizi where a conflict between the majority Babembe group and the neighbouring Banyamulenge - another Rwandan-speaking ethnic group - had been simmering for generations.
Fizi residents and soldiers also clashed in April 2010.
The 16 years of unrest in eastern DR Congo have become notorious for the widespread sexual abuse of women and young girls.
More than 300 women, men and children were raped by a coalition of rebel groups in the town of Luvungi and neighbouring villages in North Kivu within miles of a UN base in August.",An army commander in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has been accused of leading the recent mass rape of at least 50 women.
"The situation inside the city is very stressful. Everyone knows more destruction is coming. There is not much movement on the streets and people are not leaving their homes, unless absolutely necessary or if there is an emergency.
Some try to store food in case the city falls under siege. We are very scared, and we are worried that the final stages are going to take long. IS will not give up and withdraw that easily and the whole operation might take as long as it did in east Mosul.
The hospitals are not fully functioning, and IS is using them to treat its own fighters only. Civilians go to private clinics if they need to get treatment. This is of course very expensive. IS is forcing some of the doctors to stay at the hospitals to treat their fighters.
There are a number of civilians who are trying to leave towards Syria, but this only happens covertly.
I have become used to the situation here. Though I am very worried about my family's safety.
I won't lie, I am scared too and I don't know if I am going to die in an air strike or killed by an IS fighter. I work for an anti-IS group called Sound and Picture and I am always worried that something could happen to my family because of me, or that they will see me in an IS video if get captured.
IS is reinforcing its presence in the outskirts of the western part of the city. It is converting some of the houses into secret offices and operation rooms. They have also banned their fighters from taking breaks or going on leave.
We hear the sound of bombs and clashes all over the city. Planes have been flying over the city constantly over the past two weeks.
The city is a ghost town now. You very rarely find people on the streets. Busiest times are during prayer times, as IS still forces people to go to the mosques. In some mosques, names are being taken of those attending to later punish those who didn't attend the prayers.
We are all concerned it is going to take a long time till the city is liberated. After all, it took a long time for the east to be liberated. Many people have died or were injured.
We are also worried about food supplies and medicine stocks. If the situation continues as it is, we will run low on goods very soon. The medical situation is very worrying. Essential medicine, like insulin, are not there as IS took most of the stock.
My father has diabetes and I can't provide him with insulin or other medication. His health is getting worse.
My mother has high blood pressure and I can't buy her the necessary medicine; it is either not available or too expensive. I don't know what to do or how to help them.
People, including my neighbours, are trying to leave, but very few can afford to do so.
Some people had to pay $800 (Â£638) to an IS fighter to allow them to leave at night, secretly. And of course, leaving remains a big risk as some of those who attempted to flee were caught and killed.
There are still daily arrests in the city. Many are accused of working with ""foreign parties"", and - although IS militants are no longer strict about appearances - they punish those who smoke.
And they are shutting all internet cafes, making it very difficult for civilians to get any news from the outside world or to connect with anyone outside Mosul.
I am just like everyone else. The only advantage I have is that I have internet access. Of course, no-one knows about it and I am always worried that I get caught, as using the internet is a crime here.
In my neighbourhood, there are checkpoints everywhere, around the clock. I heard some fighters have defected and IS are looking for them.
The streets don't look the same. Some of the neighbourhoods are beyond recognition. IS fighters are on alert, and the city is full of ramparts. It is like a proper military zone.
In some neighbourhoods, there are curfews between 9pm and 6am. Those who break the curfew and go outside are usually fined with a hefty penalty that could be as high as $1,000.
Of course, the humanitarian situation is getting worse day-by-day. There is barely milk for children. I am married with children and we don't have enough food to feed them. My husband can't provide enough for the family. Some goods are too expensive, while others are simply not available anymore.
This week I went outside the house and life didn't feel normal. I went to the shop and there were barely any goods on the shelves. Everything is a luxury now.
Everyone is scared and they are afraid of what might come next.
My in-laws live in a different neighbourhood in the city. We haven't seen them in a very long time. We have thought about escaping, but when you're a family with young children such a decision is not an easy one.","Civilians in western Mosul describe what it is like there at the moment, as Iraqi forces try to drive out so-called Islamic State (IS)."
"The council said a decision would be made on the Princes Jetty location on Princes Parade after a feasibility study later this year.
Plans for a terminal in the Cunard Building were scrapped in 2014, because of an estimated cost of up to Â£15m.
The city last hosted regular transatlantic crossings in 1968.
An existing terminal at Princes Parade is estimated to have generated Â£7m for the Liverpool economy last year, the council said.
Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson said: ""The temporary cruise liner building has been a tremendous success and served us well, but a city of Liverpool's standing and ambition needs a permanent building if we are to continue the growth we've seen in recent years.""
He added the cost of any development at Princes Jetty would be offset by the passengers' economic impact.
But he stressed there was ""lots of work to do before we can give any scheme the green light"".
A council spokesman said there had been ""a doubling in the number of vessels visiting Liverpool"" - from 31 to 61 - since they were able to turn around in the city's waters in 2012.
""Passenger numbers are up from 38,656 four years ago to an expected 86,365 this year.""
The council has commissioned a study ""into the design and cost of constructing a terminal capable of handling 3,600 embarking and disembarking passengers with baggage - twice as many as the existing facility"", he added.
Cunard director Angus Struthers said it would examine if it could ""incorporate Liverpool into Queen Mary 2's iconic transatlantic crossings"" if the terminal plans are approved.
Liverpool hosted the headquarters of Cunard from its launch in 1840 until the 1960s, when it moved to Southampton.
A final decision is expected to be taken later this year.",Liverpool has identified the preferred site of a proposed permanent cruise terminal that could see transatlantic crossings return to the city.
"Home Secretary Theresa May said Mr Bristow would lead an agency of ""powerful operational crime fighters"".
The NCA becomes fully operational in 2013 when it takes over from the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
Its expanded role will include powers to order police forces to run operations into drugs and trafficking.
As well as replacing the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca), the new agency will take in the work of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (Ceop), and also house the national cyber crime unit. It will also cover border policing and economic crime.
""For too long we have lacked a strong, collaborative national response in the fight for criminal justice. The NCA will make the UK a more hostile environment for serious and organised crime and strengthen our border,"" Mrs May said.
She said Mr Bristow would play ""a vital role"" in developing the agency.
Details of an extensive policing shake-up, which included the creation of the National Crime Agency, were unveiled last year by Mrs May in a Home Office consultation paper - Policing in the 21st Century.
She described it as the ""most radical reform of policing for 50 years"".
Mr Bristow said he would work with the government and other crime agencies ""to ensure that the NCA delivers the maximum protection possible for communities within the resources it has available"".
""In partnership with other law enforcement agencies, we will ensure that criminals are identified, pursued and brought to justice, their groups dismantled and their activities disrupted. We will do even more to strip away their illegally obtained assets,"" he said.
Association of Chief Police Officers president Sir Hugh Orde said Mr Bristow had been chosen from ""a very strong field of police leaders"" to lead the NCA.
""A better co-ordinated response between the international reach and capability of this new agency and the 'eyes and ears' of local neighbourhood policing teams can help keep our streets and communities safer,"" Sir Hugh said.
Mr Bristow was appointed chief constable of Warwickshire Police in 2006 and chairs the G8 Law Enforcement Group.
He has been the Association of Chief Police Officers' head of crime and worked in the West Midlands Police and as director of the National Criminal Intelligence Service.","The first head of the UK's incoming National Crime Agency (NCA) will be Keith Bristow, currently chief constable of Warwickshire."
"On market days, stalls cover the square of my local town in front of the old abbey and the car parks are full.
Wander through the tight streets and it's hard to see that anything is different - it looks and feels the same as it always has - but a silent revolution is under way.
Since 2010, national spending on local government has halved and all of our communities are having to make do with less.
In Selby, the police cells and magistrates court have been closed, CCTV and bus services have been cut back, street wardens have been axed and many of the street lights turn off at midnight.
And a voluntary army is at work.
On the outskirts of the town, Terry Heselton manages a team of volunteers who run Barlby library - which would have closed without their efforts.
""Most people would prefer it if the council could carry on providing the library service, but in the real world that's simply not going to happen,"" he says.
Nationally, the number of library volunteers has almost doubled since 2010. It is a new model of civic provision and it brings savings, but Terry says he had doubts.
""Your initial reaction as a group of volunteers is 'we're taking people's jobs, aren't we?' And I'm sure there are some people who still think that, but at the end of the day, I think we now know year-on-year, there's increasing cuts. We're never going to go back to running things the way they used to be.""
North Yorkshire County Council funds many of the services in Selby, but its spending power is shrinking by a third.
The council has already saved £116m and it says it has done what it can to protect frontline services, with 60% of the savings found in the back office and more than 100 managers leaving.
Gary Fielding has to make the figures work. He says the first cuts were genuine efficiency improvements, but it's got harder.
""You go for the low-hanging fruit, you then grasp for the medium-height fruit and we're now getting the stepladders out and really climbing up that tree,"" he says.
""We will always provide essential services to the most vulnerable, but change has got to happen - even on frontline services.""
Eighty-year-old Jean Collins volunteers in the Age UK Selby District offices in the town centre.
The council used to pay for workers at the charity to visit isolated elderly people in their homes as part of a befriending scheme, but funding has now been redistributed to other Age UK organisations in Yorkshire and other befriending services in the town.
The charity can now only afford to pay for a phone line in the office.
One person affected by the changes is 87-year-old Betty McIntyre, who lives on her own in the village of Brayton, just outside Selby.
She had a fall last year and has been confined to a chair in her living room for seven months. In one recent call, she told Jean: ""I've been crying my eyes out because I've been so upset. All the painkillers - it's not doing me any good.""
She understands why the visits have become phone calls but says: ""You feel closer to the people who are coming to visit you than [those who talk] on the phone, you get a picture of them.""
Betty is worried about how the cuts affect people in her age group and says they can't get the help they need.
Selby has a Conservative MP, Nigel Adams, and District and County Councils with Tory majorities. Like voters across the country, people here chose a government which promised to balance the books, but that means changes to basic services.
With the closure of the police cells, anyone arrested has to be taken to York - 15 miles away. In time, the station building itself is expected to shut and the police will move into the council building.
There are 161 fewer officers in North Yorkshire than there were in 2010. The local police force has lost about £10m from its £147m annual budget and it too is making more use of volunteers.
In the village of Eggborough, south of Selby, the police station is only open to the public thanks to the unpaid locals who staff the desk.
The volunteers also patrol the countryside looking for crime, wearing police-style uniforms and driving a sponsored car.
""We're just another [pair of] eyes and ears for the police service, because rural crime covers a big, big area and it is a little bit difficult to police it. We're not there to take their role,"" says Steve Barker, who has volunteered since December 2014.
Their work is overseen by force control and North Yorkshire Police say the volunteers aren't used to replace funded services.

"The BBC has presented the company with evidence that many of its customers' router credentials have been hacked, putting them at risk of data theft.
The UK broadband provider confirmed that the sample of stolen router IDs it had been shown was real.
But it is still advising users that there is ""no need"" to change their routers' settings.
A cyber-security advisor to Europol said he was astounded by the decision.
""If TalkTalk has evidence that significant numbers of passwords are out in the wild, then at the very least they should be advising their customers to change their passwords,"" said the University of Surrey's Prof Alan Woodward.
""To say they see no need to do so is, frankly, astonishing.""
A spokeswoman for TalkTalk said that customers could change their settings ""if they wish"" but added that she believed there was ""no risk to their personal information"".
She referred the BBC to another security expert. But when questioned, he also said the company should change its advice.
The risk to TalkTalk's subscribers was first flagged over the weekend by  cyber-security researchers at Pen Test Partners.
They had been investigating the spread of a variant of the Mirai worm, which was causing several makes of routers to stop working properly.
During tests of a TalkTalk model, the researchers discovered that the vulnerability exploited by the worm was also being abused to carry out a separate attack that forced the router to reveal its wi-fi password.
But TalkTalk played down the discovery, saying it had ""not seen anything to confirm"" that users' router credentials had been stolen.
It said it was also making ""good progress"" to protect its routers.
The BBC was subsequently contacted by someone who said he had access to a database of 57,000 router IDs that had been scraped before any fix had been rolled out.
He did not reveal his identity, but agreed to share a sample of the credentials that had been harvested.
The list contained details of about 100 routers including:
The source said he wanted to highlight the problem because other more malevolent actors might have carried out a similar operation.
The BBC passed the details on to TalkTalk.
""The list that you sent me, I can confirm that they are TalkTalk router IDs,"" said its head of corporate communications.
""But we haven't seen anything to suggest that there are 57,000 of them out there.""
Hackers could not use the credentials to carry out a mass attack from afar - but they could use the IDs to identify high value targets to travel to, or they could simply drive through the streets hunting for a match.
Prof Alan Woodward said once a hacker was outside a vulnerable property, they could:
TalkTalk's spokeswoman referred the BBC to Steve Armstrong, a cyber-security instructor that she said would support it on the matter.
He said the risk to an individual user was relatively low.
""If you look at the average home user and what is on their home network, that would be exposed to an attacker,... then there is not a great deal.
""The risk is probably no higher than using a [coffee shop's] open wi-fi network.""
But he added that he still felt TalkTalk was giving the wrong advice.
""Part of my pushback to them is that they should be telling people, 'You need to change your password,'"" he said.
""At the moment, you trust your home infrastructure, and as a result of this vulnerability, that may not be [secure].""
Others have been more critical of TalkTalk's handling of the matter.
""It does a disservice to the complicated debate around security and privacy to give out advice of this fashion,"" said Don Smith, technology director at Dell SecureWorks.
Pen Test Partners' Ken Munro said: ""TalkTalk appear to be flying fast and loose with customer data security, yet again.""
The company was fined Â£400,000 last month by the Information Commissioner's Office for a previous breach that led to the theft of nearly 157,000 customers' personal details.
TalkTalk has about four million customers in total.
TalkTalk's approach contrasts with that of Eir, an Irish internet provider whose routers have also come under attack.
It told the BBC on Tuesday that it had detected ""unauthorised access"" to two Zyxel-branded routers used by 2,000 of its customers.
""We do not have any indication at this time that customer data has been lost or accessed,"" said a spokeswoman.
""Our strong advice to customers is to reset their modem and, once this is done, to change both the modem administration password as well as the wi-fi password.""
TalkTalk asked that its statement be quoted in full:
""As is widely known, the Mirai worm is an industry issue impacting many ISPs around the world, and a small number of TalkTalk customers have been affected.
""We can reassure these customers there is no risk to their personal information as a result of this router issue and there is no need for them to reset their wi-fi password.
""However, any customer with concerns can find out how to change their wi-fi password on our website or in their initial router set up guide. We have made good progress in repairing affected routers, but any customer who is still having any problems should visit our help site where they can find a guide that will show them how to reset their router.
""Alternatively, they can call us and we can talk them through the repair process or send them a new router.""
University College London's data security expert Dr Steven Murdoch suggested the statement was misleading.
""I think the press release is conflating the Mirai worm with the wi-fi password leak, and while the worm infection is dealt with for now, more work needs to be done to clear up the compromise of wi-fi passwords,"" he explained.
""I think that despite what the press release states, there is a risk to personal information.""",TalkTalk's handling of a wi-fi password breach is being criticised by several cyber-security experts.
"A Freedom of Information request by the Huffington Post UK found the cost of a journey transporting just government documents had often exceeded £100.
The total bill could be higher as figures for additional trips using pool cars were not available.
The government said there had been a ""substantial reduction"" in the cost of ministerial cars since 2011.
David Cameron announced plans to shrink the bill for ministerial cars shortly after coming to office in 2010, and the number of ministers with access to their own chauffeur-driven car was cut.
The practice of carrying ministers' ""red boxes"" in official cars is used for sensitive documentation.
In 2010, journalist Sarah Vine, the wife of the then education secretary Michael Gove, wrote that while her husband could travel home by public transport, his red box would travel separately ""in air-conditioned splendour, snug and secure in the back of a locked car"".
The red boxes travelled alone using the Government Car Service 1,910 times between 2012-13 and 2014-15, with the number of journeys rising over the course of the three years.
2011-12 £110,865
2012-13 £65,447.70
2013-14 £56,581.28
2014-15 £79,426.23
2015-16 £41,520.58

Since 2012, pool cars have also been used by departments but their use is not recorded by the DfT, the department said.
Labour MP Graham Jones told the Huffington Post: ""The Tories said they'd clamp down on wasteful spending yet they still allow hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money to be spent ferrying round briefcases in chauffeur-driven cars.""
But the Department for Transport said the total cost of carrying ministers' paperwork was just 5% of the total spent on the Government Car Service‎ and that it was committed to ensuring the service provided value for money.
A spokeswoman added: ""That is why, since 2010, the number of cars that make up the service has been reduced from 227 to 78.
""We have also been working hard to cut our operating costs in order to further reduce the cost to the public purse.
""Before April 2012, all cars were part of a government car pool and could be booked separately by ministers. After April 2012, cars were allocated to departments as departmental pool cars for use by ministers. These cars are managed by each department.""","Chauffeuring ministers' paperwork around Whitehall has cost more than £350,000 since 2011, figures show."
"Paddy Madden curled in a right-footed shot from 14 yards to give the Iron a 12th-minute lead.
The rest of the first half was a scrappy affair on a bobbly pitch where getting the ball under control was not easy.
The second half was much livelier and captain John Lundstram brought the home side level with a driven half-volley from Joe Skarz's left-wing cross in the 52nd minute.
It was Lundstram's first goal of the season and the ex-Everton midfielder was unlucky not to get a second four minutes later with a 20-yard shot which came back off the underside of the crossbar.
Madden was always a threat for Scunthorpe, and goalkeeper Simon Eastwood had to beat out a drive from the dangerous striker, and then saved his header a few moments later.
Luke Daniels' superb point-blank save kept out Liam Sercombe's volley two minutes from time, but Scunthorpe's defence was under severe pressure and, following a corner, Curtis Nelson drove a low 14-yard shot across goal for Edwards to touch home.

"Over six years, the Tackling FGM Initiative has given Â£2.8m of funding to community-based prevention schemes.
It said in a report that the funding had helped spark a necessary debate about FGM.
But it added that maintaining momentum would be difficult without more money.
The initiative was set up by five charitable trusts, including Comic Relief, to discourage the cutting of girls' sexual organs.
As well as funding the work of dozens of community groups, the money also paid for the training of more than 6,000 teachers and healthcare staff in how to spot and respond to the illegal act of female genital mutilation.
Under the scheme, people were encouraged to work within their own communities. For example, a Somali elder in Bolton recruited other men in his community to emphasise the need to protect their daughters.
But the Tackling FGM Initiative's report said there was still a lack of clarity over who should be funding future FGM prevention work.
It said local authorities, health and wellbeing boards, and public health or clinical commissioning groups all had a part to play.
The report says it is difficult to measure the success of preventing FGM because of the lack of data about an illegal procedure, but, using surveys, it found attitudes to FGM had changed.
It concludes that awareness of FGM has increased, particularly among women, and there has been a strong focus on educating young people from a wide range of communities.
But the report warns that funding is still the major barrier to ending mutilation and the authors say, in the current financial climate, it will be difficult to maintain progress.
It said: ""There is good evidence that the community-based approach has worked with a range of audiences within communities affected by FGM and has started to create a critical mass of people who are opposed to the practice.""",Community groups involved in an initiative to tackle female genital mutilation in England and Wales have warned that future progress could be threatened by a lack of local funding.
"Seven were taken to hospital, two in a serious condition, after the fire at Standon House Care Home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, on Saturday night.

"Initial Environment Agency figures showed £86,000 was spent on a wildlife survey and putting the animals in winter storage at a cost of £24,000.
But the latest figures show the total cost was higher - working out at £2,454 per vole.
The agency said it had a duty to move the legally protected species.
'Feel vibrations'
Previously, the agency said the wildlife survey was not part of the cost of relocating the voles.
But the BBC has since learned the cost of setting up traps along the river banks and checking them over a period of several months was not previously disclosed.
Farmer James Winslade said when annual dredging took place before the agency took over, it had not appeared to affect the vole population.
""They're not stupid, they'll feel the vibration and move on - it's not like they haven't any other habitat to move on to,"" he said.
""The riverbank adjoins fields so they can move from the riverbanks to the fields.""
Money spent on relocating the voles was a small percentage of the £6m spent on dredging five miles (8 km) of the rivers Tone and Parrett, the agency said previously.
The voles spent the winter in an ""over-wintering facility"" before being moved to Hampshire and Cornwall, according to the figures.

Lallana struck in the 95th minute to seal a 5-4 win moments after Sebastien Bassong had equalised for the Canaries.
Klopp was swamped by his players - and his trademark specs slipped off.
""I have a second pair of glasses, but I can't find them,"" said Klopp. ""It's hard to find glasses without glasses.""
Klopp has broken his glasses before during a match, with that pair residing in his former club Borussia Dortmund's museum.
""We won for the first time against Bayern Munich and Nuri Sahin broke my glasses. Today it was Adam Lallana,"" he added.
Read about how the dramatic game unfolded
Klopp may have been smiling at half-time but just moments earlier he was fuming at his players for allowing Bassong to make it 4-4.
The Reds' defending had been particularly poor throughout, with Norwich having scored from every shot they had on target to lead 3-1.
""There was about 70 minutes that were really good,"" said the 48-year-old.
""Conceding four goals is in general not good. Conceding from set plays is the biggest rubbish ever because it is too easy for the other team.
""Usually we concede from a corner but now it was from the second ball - we were like rabbits in the headlights, but we won the game in the end.""

Klopp was not the only person who felt his side should have defended better in the game.

"The prime minister said the UK should still be part of summits and negotiations when matters affecting all 28 member states were being discussed.
Sources have denied the issue was the subject of a row at a dinner at the EU summit - Mrs May's first as PM.
Both the French president and German chancellor warned if Mrs May pursued a ""hard Brexit"", talks would be hard too.
Arriving at the summit in Brussels on Thursday, Mrs May pledged to continue to ""work closely"" with the EU after Brexit.
She stressed it was important to have a ""united European stance"" against ""Russian aggression"" that included ""sickening"" violence in Syria.
She told fellow leaders they ""must be ready to take steps to change Russia's approach and the way it thinks about this if we are ever to bring an end to the violence in Syria"", according to No 10 sources.
Before sitting down for a dinner with fellow EU leaders that included pan-fried scallops, crown of lamb with roast fig and iced vanilla parfait, sources said Mrs May raised the issue of continuing UK participation in negotiations at an earlier meeting.
Sources said she was keen that the UK was still fully included in discussions that affected all members - particularly on security issues - but denied she was concerned about being ""frozen out"".
Troubled by the need to find a common approach to Russian ambitions in Syria, and distracted by a faltering trade deal with Canada, the EU's leaders didn't have Brexit at the top of this summit agenda.
So long did proceedings over-run that it was reportedly 01:00 local time before Mrs May took the floor to offer a Brexit briefing.
And brief it proved to be - EU sources said she spoke for around five minutes and there were no speeches in response from the other leaders.
She used the summit though to make an important point - that just as Brexit means Brexit, so the UK remains IN the EU until the moment when it's officially out.
The British view is that that means the 27 countries that will remain shouldn't jump the gun in starting to make decisions that exclude the UK. That message has now been delivered.
But German MEP Manfred Weber told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's not really normal that such a member who wants to leave a club like the EU also wants to decide the future of this club. That's really creating a lot of anger; the behaviour of the British government.""
The prime minister has promised to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty - beginning two years of formal exit negotiations with the EU - by the end of March.
This means Brexit, backed in a UK-wide referendum in June, will take place by the summer of 2019.
The Brussels summit is not focused on Brexit but on issues like migration, trade and relations with Russia.
On arrival, Mrs May said: ""The UK is leaving the EU, but we will continue to play a full role until we leave and we will be a strong and dependable partner after we have left.""
""It's in the interests of both the UK and the EU that we continue to work closely together, including at this summit.""
European Council President Donald Tusk has insisted no formal talks between the UK and the EU can start until Article 50 is invoked.
But he offered Mrs May some words of encouragement, saying: ""Some media described her first meeting in the European Council as entering the lion's den. It's not true. It's more like a nest of doves.
""You can be sure she will be absolutely safe with us.""
But French President Francois Hollande said:  ""I say very firmly, (if) Mrs May wants a hard Brexit, the negotiations will be hard.""
And German Chancellor Angela Merkel echoed that view, saying: ""In practice, that will be a tough road.""
Joseph Muscat, prime minister of Malta - which will take over the next presidency of the EU - told the BBC he hoped to hear Mrs May's ""list of priorities"" for Brexit, but did not expect any ""negotiations"" during the summit: ""We wouldn't expect to hear a specific plan with all the intricacies.""
Meanwhile the President of the European Council Donald Tusk said at the dinner that he would prefer it if the UK reversed the referendum decision but added: ""It's not our choice...We have to respect the decision of the referendum. If it is reversible or not, this is in the British hands. I would be the happiest one if it reversible but we now we have to start our formal works.""
Lord Hill, the UK's former EU Commissioner, told BBC Radio 4's Today that there remained, among other EU members, a ""surprisingly widely held view that Britain might still decide to stay in"" - something he had sought to dispel.
He also warned those arguing that other EU states would not want to harm business with the UK by imposing punitive trade measures that the EU was seen as an ""emotional"", ""political"" and ""quite a romantic"" project.
""If we think, in the UK, that ultimately economic rationalism will win out in terms of the negotiation that is to misread how the Europeans will approach this negotiation,"" he said.","Britain expects to be part of EU decision-making until Brexit, Theresa May has told fellow EU leaders."
"Labour's Carwyn Jones said his government would fight Wales' corner, while Conservative Andrew RT Davies promised a ""brighter future"".
Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood pledged to share her vision across Wales in 2016, while the Lib Dem's Kirsty Williams said her party was ""up for the fight"".
UKIP is also expected to win its very first seats in the assembly in May.
Giving his New Year's message, the Welsh Labour leader highlighted the organ donation laws as a defining moment in 2015.
""For me, one of our greatest achievements of the year was Wales becoming the first country in the UK to introduce a new system for organ donation,"" said Mr Jones.
He said his government continued to invest ""record amounts"" in the Welsh NHS, while delivering improvements in education, and economic growth that ""continues to outperform the UK as a whole"".
He also wished the Wales football team well ahead of the Euro 2016 finals in France.
But with a fight on his hand to win outright in May's elections, the Labour leader added: ""We'll never take our foot off the pedal, we'll always fight Wales' corner, striving for the best. The people of Wales deserve nothing less.""
In his address, the Welsh Tory leader said 2016 gave Wales the chance for a ""fresh start"".
""After 17 years with Welsh Labour at the helm, Wales finds itself at a crossroads and there are big decisions ahead,"" said Mr Davies.
He said voters had a straight choice between ""the change Wales needs for a brighter future, or sticking with Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party"".
Leanne Wood takes her party into the Welsh general election as leader for the first time, stating she will be travelling the ""length and breadth of our country and making the case for Plaid Cymru and sharing my vision for Wales"".
""On that election day, the path Wales chooses will be in your hands. Forward with Plaid or more of the same, from the same old politicians.""
Liberal Democrat leader Ms Williams said Wales was ""crying out for fresh ideas and a government that puts people first"".
""In 2016 our mission will be to show people that we will help them reach their aspirations, that we have a record of delivery for our communities and that our values are needed in the assembly now more than ever,"" she said.
But while all four party leaders push their own messages home, they will also be keeping one eye on the challenge from UKIP, and what it may mean come 5 May.
Opinion polls have suggested UKIP could win several seats in the Senedd.
Their Welsh leader Nathan Gill told his party conference in the autumn that he was ""extremely hopeful"" of winning seven or eight assembly seats.
""I have long predicted Wales will be one of the strongest regions for UKIP in the United Kingdom,"" he said.
""Next May will see that come to fruition.""",The assembly's four party leaders have delivered New Year messages with an eye on the 2016 elections.

There was chanting by pro and anti-China supporters and, during a press photo call for the Amnesty protesters, huge Chinese flags interrupted their line of vision and drumming from the groups in support of the leader intensified.
People handed out bright red 'I love China' t-shirts and the crowds coming out in favour of President Xi dwarfed those who rallied against the communist ruler.
Among Amnesty International protesters was Dr Shao Ting, a research scholar who was involved with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest.

The imposing centre-back did not make his top-flight debut until he was 30, but is now captaining the Premier League leaders in one of the most incredible seasons the Premier League has ever seen.
Just over 18 months on from finally making it into England's top division, Morgan talks to BBC East Midlands Today about title dreams, his mum's burgeoning pride and how his journey was nearly over almost as soon as it started.
Morgan was released by Notts County as a youngster in 1999 but after a couple of years playing non-league football, he was given a second chance across the River Trent.
But the journey was still far from smooth. John Pemberton, then Forest's academy director, remembered having to keep Morgan away from manager Paul Hart when he first joined because he simply wasn't fit enough.
""His socks didn't go up to his knees because his calves were too big, his legs rubbed together and his shirt was skin tight. He was well overweight,"" Pemberton said.
""Paul saw him in the car park and said: 'Who's that lad?' We said he was a trialist and Paul said: 'We don't want any trialists looking like that'. So we hid from the manager - and we actually hid him for about eight months.""
Morgan said: ""Getting released wasn't nice. It was hard to take. But I remained positive and I got a trial at Forest and that was an opportunity to get back into it and that's where it all started.""
Despite an inauspicious beginning, Morgan is quick to thank Hart for the big part he played in getting his career up and running.
After heeding the timely fitness advice, Morgan made his debut as a 19-year-old in August 2003 and soon became a first-team regular.
""I came on trial and did well and was kept on for the season,"" Morgan said.
""I wasn't in the best shape possible and had to work hard. There was a lot of conditioning work to get to the point where I needed to be.
""You have to be at a certain fitness level and I needed to put in the work to get to that point.
""I have nothing but good things to say about Paul Hart. He gave me my first professional contract and my debut. It all began with him.""
Hart told BBC Sport: ""When I first saw him he was quite big and I said I am not putting him in our kit until that changes.
""But he worked extremely hard. You always saw a good footballer; he always had the basics. I gave him his debut at left-back and he was excellent.
""Wesley was very aware of his strengths and weaknesses, and when you have that you have a great chance.""
Morgan's move across the East Midlands after 10 years with Forest came as a shock in 2012, but Leicester manager Nigel Pearson was desperate for a dominant centre-back who was both a reliable leader and a steadying influence.
He was convinced he found his man, saying Morgan was a player they wanted to build their team around as they looked to win promotion from the Championship.
""He's as good a defender as there is at this level and has been since he's been here - never mind just this season,"" Pearson said.
Morgan has remained one of the many Pearson players to play a central role in their astonishing season under new manager Claudio Ranieri.
And Morgan is enjoying every moment.
""To be in the position we are in is an achievement in itself,"" he said. ""Anything that happens now is definitely a bonus. People tipped us to be relegated at the start of the season and we are competing at the top of the league.
""We are just delighted with how things have gone so far.
""We have a real confidence and belief and know that on our day we can be as good, if not better, than anyone out there in this league.""
Morgan has spent much of Leicester City's fixture-free week coaching youngsters with his lifelong friend and former Forest team-mate Julian Bennett.
The pair grew up together in The Meadows, one of Nottingham's toughest areas. The council estate has a reputation for gun crime, drugs and gangs and Morgan has always said his love for football could well have saved from a very different path.
It makes him appreciate his life even more.
""It has always been a dream of mine to play in the Premier League and I have done,"" Morgan said. ""I am very thankful for that and I am glad to be able to give something back with the coaching alongside my good friend Julian.
""From as early as I can remember I used to see Jules - he used to live two or three minutes away from me and playing football on the streets was a big part of growing up. We have always had that passion.
""I thought the opportunity to play in the Premier League had passed me by. Everyone wants to play at the highest level and it took a lot longer than I anticipated and wanted, but I got there eventually.
""I am enjoying it a lot!""

Morgan's biggest fan is undoubtedly his mother. The pride and love is unconditional of course, but even he has noticed a slight change of late.
""Right now things are going well so I'm getting extra kisses on the end of the text message after games,"" Morgan said.
""She is obviously delighted. But win, lose or draw she is happy for me and what I have achieved. I know she is very proud of me and it's good to have that support.""",Leicester City defender Wes Morgan's rise has been just as remarkable as that of the team he leads.
"The company has made an all-stock deal worth as much as $2.8bn (£1.9bn).
Tesla shares fell 10% in extended trading after the announcement while SolarCity jumped 23%.
California-based Tesla is known as a pioneer in electric cars but since last year has also been selling batteries that can power homes and businesses.
Tesla chief executive Elon Musk described the deal as a ""no brainer"".
He said it would transform Tesla into the ""world's only vertically integrated energy company offering end-to-end clean energy products"", from solar panels and home storage batteries to electric vehicles.
Elon Musk is under serious pressure to make Tesla profitable. The path to that goal is two-fold. The cars may eventually bring in serious money, but the outlay needed to fund the manufacture of the vehicles is far greater than what sales are bringing in.
But while Tesla is considered to be a carmaker first and foremost, the real money might be in selling energy technology. Its enormous Gigafactory, opening this summer, will be able to make batteries for much more than cars.
The SolarCity purchase was always on the cards. Musk is already the firm's chairman and biggest shareholder, and the company's chief executive, Lyndon Rive, is Musk's cousin.
Some are questioning why Tesla had to buy SolarCity rather than just work closely with it.

"The game on 5 November is outside World Rugby's Test window and English clubs do not have to release players for it.
Gloucester flanker Ross Moriarty has said he expects to miss the match.
""As it stands, George will not be available for that game,"" Saints team manager Paul Shields said.
He told BBC Radio Northampton: ""I know discussions are ongoing with the WRU and the [English clubs'] chairmen but I'm not privy to those conversations.""
The decision to release England-based Wales internationals is now in the hands of Premier Rugby, the umbrella organisation for England's top-tier clubs.
Following the match against Australia, Wales face Argentina, Japan and South Africa later in the month - those Tests fall inside World Rugby's international window, which mean clubs must release their players.
The decision by Premiership clubs on whether to release players for the first match will also have ramifications for Harlequins centre Jamie Roberts and Bath's injured number eight Taulupe Faletau.
Earlier this week, Wales coach Rob Howley appeared to suggest North, Roberts and Faletau had special dispensation to play against the Wallabies.
However, Shields said: ""George is no different than any other non-English player. There's no side letter that exists or anything in his contract that says we will release George to play.
""We're governed by Premier Rugby, who as a company will not release players outside the international window.""
Meanwhile, Moriarty has said: ""For the games after [Australia], I'll hope to be involved and have a good chance to play again.""
Following fine performances for Wales during their summer tour in New Zealand, Moriarty has continued that form with Gloucester and received another call-up.
""Sometimes I've been left with my head in my hands worrying [about a call-up] but I had a conversation a couple of weeks ago and it was a pretty big hint,"" he told BBC Radio Gloucestershire.
""It's been on my mind for a while now. But as long as I can keep on performing and doing the best I can to help the team then that's what I'll keep on doing.""","Wing George North is not currently available for Wales' Test against Australia but talks between the Welsh Rugby Union and English clubs are ongoing, his club Northampton says."
"The Lib Dem MP for Bristol West said pubs in parts of the city were closing because of the decline of the ""white working class"" and the arrival of migrants from Somalia and elsewhere.
He said reports of his remarks had been ""twisted"" to suggest a focus on race.
He had simply been proposing derelict premises should be converted, he said.
The comments were made as Mr Williams was outlining a government proposal to protect community pubs.
The plan involves changing the law to prevent places listed as assets of community value being demolished or having their use changed without planning permission.
Some campaigners had called for the government to go further and impose a blanket ban on the redevelopment of all pubs without planning permission.
Arguing against a blanket ban, Mr Williams told MPs: ""In my own constituency, lots of pubs have closed - but it is usually because of demographic change.
""Some parts of my constituency, which had a 'white working-class community' 20 or 30 years ago, are now populated primarily by recently arrived Somalis and other people.
""Obviously the pubs in those areas have closed, and some have been converted to other uses, but some of them are still derelict.
""What the government is proposing is to look at the public houses that are genuinely popular and valued by the community now, giving them protection that is already allowed in the Localism Act and further enhancing that protection in terms of the planning laws, saying you cannot convert this pub into another use or demolish it without planning permission.""
Some reports, including one in the Daily Telegraph newspaper, with the headline ""'Somali immigrants' cause pub closures"", had taken his comments out of context, Mr Williams said.
""There was no value judgement in what I said. It was simply an observation,"" he told the BBC.
""Some pubs in the Barton Hill and Redcliffe area of my constituency have closed because of the arrival of a non-drinking Muslim population to the area.
""I could have made a point about pubs closing because of the decline of a factory or a football stadium - both of which also apply to my constituency,"" he said.
""I was simply saying there was no point us giving blanket protection to all pubs, as some people suggest.
""But what we are announcing is powers for people across the country to protect their much-loved pubs by triggering a planning application if they are listed as a community asset.""
Mr Williams rejected any suggestion his comments had been motivated by a negative view of migration.
""I have consistently argued that immigration is a good thing,"" he said. ""That is my view as a Liberal.""",Communities Minister Stephen Williams has defended his remarks in Parliament about the threat to pubs in his constituency from population changes.

"They think it could be used to improve nutritional advice or in weight loss because people are notoriously bad at recording their own eating habits.
The test, detailed in the Lancet Diabetes and Endocrinology, detects chemicals made as food is processed by the body.
The research team believe it could be widely available within two years.
The urine samples are analysed to determine the structure of the chemicals floating around in it using a technique called a proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
This gives clues to both recent meals and long term dietary habits.
The results of your body processing fruit, vegetables, fish and different types of meat leave a distinct signature in the urine.
Clues to the state of the body's metabolism and gut health can also be detected by investigating the chemicals in it.
The test was developed by a collaboration between Imperial College London, Newcastle University and Aberystwyth University.
Dr Isabel Garcia-Perez, one of the researchers at Imperial, said: ""This will eventually provide a tool for personalised dietary monitoring to help maintain a healthy lifestyle.
""We're not at the stage yet where the test can tell us a person ate 15 chips yesterday and two sausages, but it's on the way.""
In trials, around 60% of people either under or over report what they are eating.
Prof Gary Frost, another scientist at Imperial, said this could be the first independent test of what people munch on at home.
He told the BBC News website: ""You can really tell whether someone's been following a healthy diet or not.
""The bigger you are the more likely you are to under-report what you eat.
""People find it difficult to open up to what types of foods they eat at home, which is a major problem.""
The researchers believe the test results could help combat people's obesity or risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes.
Prof Frost said: ""If someone is very big and their profile says they're eating lots of energy dense foods like meat, then you can try to change that profile and then test them again later.
""It remains to be seen, but people might respond better to that and there is a desperate need for tools to help people change their diet.""
He says doing the test on large numbers of people would build up a picture of what the nation was really eating, which could be used to design better public health campaigns.
The scientists were able to spot the difference between healthy and unhealthy diets after tests on 19 people who spent days eating a carefully controlled set of meals.
Four diets of varying degrees of healthiness were given to the patients and their urine was sampled morning, noon and night.
Dr Des Walsh, from the UK Medical Research Council, commented: ""Though this research is still in its early stages, it's grappling with essential methods in food and diet studies where advances are really needed.
""Measuring what we eat and drink more accurately will widen the benefits of nutrition research, developing better evidence-based interventions to improve an individual's health and reduce obesity.""

About 4,000 people applied to the UK Foreign Office in 1964-65 for help from a £1m fund, paid for by West Germany.
A quarter of claims were successful.
Many were rejected because, though the claimants had suffered under the Nazis as prisoners of war or civilian internees, their imprisonment had not been illegal. Others were rejected because they were not British citizens.
The archives contain often brutal accounts of suffering and persecution, as well as the responses of Foreign Office bureaucrats charged with administering the fund.
The money was aimed principally at concentration camp survivors who had not won compensation under a separate German scheme set up in 1953.
Among those whose claims were rejected was Jimmy James, who took part in the Great Escape from Stalag Luft 3 in 1944 - made famous in the film of the same name. Fifty of the escapers were shot.
Jimmy James, along with others, was sent to a punishment camp known as Sonderlager A at Sachsenhausen concentration camp, north of Berlin.
By 1964, his file shows he was working for the Foreign Office as a visa officer at the British Embassy in Prague.
The file includes his handwritten account of his years in Nazi captivity, including his imprisonment with 18 others - six of them British - at Sachsenhausen - and a period spent in solitary inside the main camp when he once again tunnelled his way out, only to be recaptured.
He acknowledged the conditions he was kept under were not as harsh as those in Sachsenhausen proper, and that he could claim no permanent disability, before adding laconically, ""although, naturally, this is an experience which I should have preferred to have avoided"".
His claim was rejected on the grounds that as a prisoner of war he was not a victim of ""Nazi persecution"".
But there was a sequel.
Some of his fellow ""Great Escapees"" went to the newspapers to complain and the foreign secretary set up an inquiry which resolved on pay-outs to the Sachsenhausen victims after all.
All were officers and two bore the name Churchill.  In 1968 James got a cheque for £1,192 and 15 shillings.
That emboldened others to underline their own claims.
Another file contains correspondence with an anonymous former soldier in the Cameron Highlanders regiment. The names of people in many of the files have been blacked out, or redacted, on data protection grounds.
In 1964 he had applied for compensation, describing himself as ""an incorrigible escaper and troublemaker"" who had ""suffered persecution in four punishment camps"".
His claim was rejected.
In 1968 he wrote a long and outraged letter in the wake of the Sachsenhausen decision.
It reiterated his prison camp record, the ill-treatment he had suffered and the effects on his health, adding that he had also spent time in Buchenwald.
""Do I need to appeal to the House of Lords like the elite who were awarded this money?"" he asked.
The Foreign Office asked the German authorities and the Red Cross for evidence that he had been in Buchenwald, but they could find no record, and when the man himself was asked for further details he never replied.
But someone who did get compensation was Tania Rosandic, the daughter of Violette Szabo, an agent of Special Operations Executive who died in Ravensbruck concentration camp. Szabo's experience was also later reflected in a film - called Carve Her Name with Pride.
A friend of Tania Rosandic's mother's wrote from Ireland to press the girl's claim, which was accepted, but not before her solicitors had to find not only her mother's French birth certificate but also her grandfather's, to prove she was British.  She got a total of £2,295 and 15 shillings.
Several of those who applied for compensation were Channel Islanders who had been arrested by the Nazi occupiers and taken to Germany as forced labourers.
Harold Le Druillenec, from Jersey, ended up in Bergen-Belsen. He was the only British survivor.
""Jungle law reigned,"" he wrote of the camp.
""At night you killed or were killed; by day cannibalism was rampant.""
He spent his days heaving bodies into mass graves, though too weak himself to dig the holes, and later gave evidence at the war crimes trials of Belsen's commandant and guards.  He was awarded £1,835.
But others were not successful. Ludmila Kokrda spent five-and-a-half years in Nazi custody, including a year in Ravensbruck concentration camp.
She was forced to work on clearing a swamp, often in heavy rain, wearing nothing but a cotton shirt and living on a diet of beetroot or beetroot leaves and potato peelings.
But she and her husband - a Czech army colonel who had fought in both world wars and had fled to Britain twice to escape both the Nazis and later the communists - were not British citizens.
Their application was rejected, despite the fact that the Liberal Party leader Jeremy Thorpe had taken up their case.","Harrowing accounts of Nazi persecution against UK victims have been revealed in 1960s files from the National Archives, which show them claiming compensation for their suffering."
"Gordon Ross, 66, said he hoped the judicial review would clarify the legal position regarding assisted suicide.
He has called on the Lord Advocate to issue guidance that makes clear whether any person who helps him end his life would be charged with an offence.
Judge Lord Doherty reserved his decision in the action and will give a ruling at a later date.
The Director of Public Prosecutions has issued guidelines for England but these do not apply to Scotland.
Campaigners opposed to assisted suicide argue that changing the law would be a ""catastrophe"" in terms of how society confronts illness and disability, as well as ""devaluing"" suicide prevention efforts.
But Mr Ross said he believes that the present legal situation ""encourages suicide"" and discriminated against people with a disability.
While he did not attend the hearing in person due to poor health, supporters of the pensioner's case staged a demonstration outside the court in Edinburgh's Parliament Square.
Campaigners have previously urged MSPs to pass the Assisted Suicide Bill which was introduced to Holyrood by the late MSP Margo Macdonald, and which is currently being taken forward by Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie.
A Holyrood committee recently concluded that the bill contained ""significant flaws"" and opposed its general principles, but said the full parliament should decide whether or not to throw out the proposed legislation.
Mr Ross, a former TV producer lives in a care home in Glasgow, suffers from several serious medical conditions including Parkinson's disease and loss of sensation in his arms and legs.
He is unable to walk and uses a wheelchair, and cannot feed or dress himself or attend to his personal needs.
Explaining his decision to bring the case, Mr Ross said he fears that, should a time come when he has ""had enough"", he will not be capable of ending his life without help - unlike an able-bodied person.
He said: ""I believe that, as a disabled person, I am currently being discriminated against. Anyone else, in any circumstances, can choose to end their own lives at any time. Because of my disability that is something I am unable to do.
""I do not wish to end my life, I want it to go on as long as I can. However, if my condition deteriorates to the point that I do want to take that action, I want to know what action the law might take were someone to assist me.""
Gordon Ross is quite clear: he does not want to die.
As a committed nationalist, he says he is looking forward to the Holyrood election in 2016 and possibly a further independence referendum.
But he knows he may not see that happening.
The 66-year-old grandfather lives in a care home on the south side of Glasgow, where his disabilities mean he requires help for all of his personal needs - including feeding and drinking.
He suffers from Parkinson's disease, which gives him violent shaking fits, leaving him weak and exhausted.
He also has a condition which has damaged his nervous system, meaning he has no feeling in his hands or feet.
'If the time comes, I will need help'
Mr Ross also argued that the current legal position encourages suicide.
He said: ""Amongst those with conditions such as mine, people might choose to take their own life before they would otherwise want to because they know they won't be able to in future.
""Ending life early in such circumstances is tragic and the law should not be putting up barriers to prevent people from living longer.
""I hope the court will consider this and compel the Lord Advocate to issue guidance, as exists in England, as to what support can or cannot be given to people in situations such as mine.""
Mr Ross's counsel Aidan O'Neill QC said: ""The present application is based on the submission that the refusal by the Lord Advocate to set out policy guidelines is unlawful because it's incompatible in respect of the convention rights.""
Lawyers for the Lord Advocate dispute the claims and further argue that it would be inappropriate for the court to make any order while the Assisted Suicide (Scotland) Bill is still being considered at the Scottish Parliament.
Gerry Moynihan QC told Judge Lord Doherty: ""There is no lack of clarity.""
""The Lord Advocate is being asked to produce guidelines on prosecution for assisted suicide. We do not prosecute for assisted suicide. We prosecute for murder or culpable homicide,"" he said.
He added: ""To say anything else is to give people a false expectation of immunity from prosecution. That is an illusion.""
Reserving his decision to a later date, Lord Doherty thanked counsel for their submissions ""in this interesting and important case"".
Campaigners from Friends At The End (FATE) earlier demonstrated outside the court in support of Mr Ross.
Spokesman Dr Bob Scott said: ""Gordon is suffering unnecessarily because of doubt and uncertainty. It would be reassuring for him and comforting for him to know that the rights and wrongs of his position were clarified in law.""
Proposals to legalise assisted suicide are being considered in parallel at Holyrood.
The Scottish Parliament's Health Committee recently said the plans were flawed and face ""major challenges"" going forward.
It added that while the majority of its members did not support the general principles of the Assisted Suicide Bill, it would make no formal recommendation to Parliament on the legislation as it was a matter of conscience.
Dr Gordon Macdonald of Care Not Killing, the umbrella group spearheading opposition to the proposed assisted suicide legislation, said: ""In today's individualistic society the pressures on sick, disabled and elderly people to avoid placing 'unfair burdens' on others are very great.
""Maintaining the law's protection of this silent and vulnerable majority is more important than giving choices to a minority of strong-minded and highly resolute people.""",A severely disabled grandfather has had his case seeking the right to die heard by the Court of Session.
"State department spokesman John Kirby called the plans the ""latest step... in a systematic process of land seizures"".
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said he was ""deeply disappointed"" by the Israeli government's decision.
The international Quartet of Middle East peace mediators also recently criticised settlement construction.
About 570,000 Israelis live in more than 100 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this.
Citing an Israeli official, the Associated Press reported that the Israeli plans included 560 new homes in Maale Adumim, just outside Jerusalem, as well as almost 200 in the city itself. The plan also called for more than 600 new homes in an Arab neighbourhood of East Jerusalem, AP said.
Mr Kirby said: ""If true, this report would be the latest step in what seems to be a systematic process of land seizures, settlement expansions and legalizations of outposts that is fundamentally undermining the prospects for a two-state solution.""
The plans were also sharply criticised by Ban Ki-moon.
""This raises legitimate questions about Israel's long-term intentions, which are compounded by continuing statements of some Israeli ministers calling for the annexation of the West Bank,"" the UN chief's spokesman said in a statement.
On Friday, the Quartet released a report saying Israeli settlement-building - along with continuing violence, terrorism and incitement, and lack of control of the Gaza Strip by the West-Bank based Palestinian Authority - was undermining peace hopes.
Israel welcomed parts of the Quartet report, but said it ""perpetuates the myth that Israeli construction in the West Bank is an obstacle to peace"".
The last round of peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians came to an end amid acrimony in April 2014.
The Palestinians accused Israel of reneging on a deal to free prisoners, while Israel said it would not continue negotiations after the Palestinians decided to bring the militant Islamist Hamas movement into a unity government.",The US has criticised Israeli plans to build hundreds of new homes in existing Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem.

"Xinhua state news agency said that as of Sunday afternoon the film had earned 1.317bn yuan ($212m, £137m) since it opened on 16 July.
The previous record was held by 2012 road trip comedy Lost in Thailand which earned about 1.27bn yuan.
Monster Hunt, a blend of live-action and animation, tells the story of a radish-like baby monster called Huba.
The surreal comedy is set in a fantasy world resembling ancient China, where monsters and humans co-exist uneasily in two separate lands.
When revolutionaries in the monsters' world attempt to overthrow their royalty, the monster queen flees to the land of humans and impregnates a hapless human man, Tianyin, with Huba.
He ends up being pursued by both monsters and monster-hating humans keen on capturing the newborn Huba.
Why China has fallen for a baby radish monster
The movie was directed by Raman Hui, who co-directed 2007 Hollywood animated film Shrek the Third.
In its review, Screen Daily praised the animator for creating ""a menagerie of eccentric and intriguing characters to rival the best fantasy adventures"".
However, it  added, Monster Hunt's ""uneven tone and wayward plotting"" could restrict its audience overseas.
The Hollywood Reporter agreed, noting that, outside China, the family-friendly film faces stiff competition from the likes of Minions and Inside Out. ""But given Monster Hunt's novel setting and sprinkling of kung fu antics"" international success is ""not completely"" out of the question.

One day,  for Great Britain? Hell, in one hour, around one small oval of track in east London, British athletes won three golds in such dizzying, dreamlike succession that all context and precedent disappeared off into the dark London sky.
You tried to grab a record book before they all got thrown on the bonfires. In the 16 Olympics from 1928 to 1996, only once did Britain win more than five golds in an entire Games. Not since 1908 had GB won five in a day, and that was an event so unrecognisable it included tug-of-war and real tennis.
The greatest single hour, the best night, unarguably, in the long history of British athletics. The best day in British sport? It sounds like hyperbole, so apply what logic you have left.
Saturday's medal count, taken just on its own, would constitute Great Britain's ninth most successful Olympic Games tally in 118 years of competition.
In three different sports, by men and women, on water and on dry land, the golds kept on rolling in, roared on by partisan crowds at stadiums across the city and its hinterland and by millions on television, radio and electronica.
From Eton Dorney to the velodrome at the north end of Stratford's Olympic Park to within toasty distance of the Olympic flame itself, there was the same expression on British faces: I can't believe I'm here, I can't believe I'm watching this.
What do you have to compare it to? England's World Cup win in 1966 was precisely that - England's. So was Jonny Wilkinson's iconic drop-goal in Sydney nine years ago.

This one truly belonged to Britain - a collective grin of national pleasure, a domino-chain of sporting success that had you clapping and cheering new heroes like you'd loved them all their lives.
The rowers had started the celebrations with gold in the men's four and the women's lightweight double sculls before track cycling's women team pursuiters added track cycling gold.
That was quite good enough. But those lucky enough to be among the 80,000 at the athletics were about to hit the jackpot in quite unprecedented fashion.
We knew after the morning's long jump and javelin that Jess Ennis would, barring pestilence and plagues of locusts, be crowned Olympic heptathlon champion. We hoped that Mo Farah might do what no British male had ever done and win a global 10,000m title. A few even lumped some cash on Greg Rutherford to win the long jump, although a gamble was exactly how it felt.
That all three came off in 46 minutes left you laughing with disbelief at the madness of it all.
When  Britain failed to win a single track and field title. Having waited 104 years for an athletics gold, three arrived in the city in such quick succession that the waves of noise barely stopped rolling.
When you looked up at one point and saw the women's 100m was about to start, there was genuine surprise. When  feels something of an anti-climax, you know you've witnessed something altogether rare.
Seven long years ago, when the 2012 Games were awarded to Britain, athletics in the host country could not have been at a lower ebb.
The British team returned from that summer's World Championships in Helsinki with a sorry haul of one gold and two bronze, ending up buried down at 16th in the medal table behind such track and field powerhouses as Estonia, Bahrain and Belarus.
To have predicted then the sort of giddy scenes we witnessed in London on Saturday night would have been to invite scorn and straitjackets.
That it happened to Ennis, Rutherford and Farah had a neat symmetry and happy resonance.
Four years ago in Beijing, all three were enduring the sort of miserable sporting slump that makes you want to sack it off and do something less capricious instead: Rutherford, nowhere and unnoticed in 10th; Farah, gone in the heats; Ennis, watching it all at home in Sheffield with her fractured right foot encased in plaster.

Here, enveloped in an atmosphere they could barely have dreamt of then and will never experience again, they touched the heights.
The Sydney Olympics of 2000 famously proclaimed it Magic Monday the day Cathy Freeman won 400m gold. London's Super Saturday had three Freemans in the time it takes you to walk across Olympic Park.
All three, wrapped in Union flags, spoke eloquently if bemusedly about what they had just experienced.
""I told myself at the start,"" said Ennis, ""that I'm only going to have one moment to do this in front of a crowd in London. I just wanted to give them a good show.""
""This is what I have dreamed of my whole life,"" said Rutherford. ""To do it in London is just incredible. I might wake up in a minute.""
Farah's blistering final lap was the crescendo to it all. As he crossed the finish line, Olympic great Kenenisa Bekele in his wake, his wife Tania and step-daughter Rihanna ran on to meet him.
Tania is eight and a half months pregnant with the couple's twins. Not now, you thought - please not now.
Eight days ago,  offered a vision of modern Britain that felt simultaneously new and familiar to every one of us.
These athletes are making it flesh, just as the experience of watching them is giving the nation a series of mutual memories to celebrate and cherish.
A mixed-race girl from Sheffield, a lad whose great-grandfather played football for England over a century ago, and a boy who arrived in west London aged eight from east Africa to make the capital his home.

The old sages always agree on two things: a Games needs a home medal in its main stadium to truly come alive, and it needs a definitive night for everyone to remember it by.
As you looked around the Olympic Stadium on Saturday night, Paul McCartney conducting the crowd from his seat as they sang, ""All You Need Is Love"", just as he had the velodrome to ""Hey Jude"" a few hours before, you realised: this is it.
This is the moment. This is the definitive night, and day, and hour.","There was a point in the Olympic Stadium on Saturday evening, at about 9.20pm, when you wanted to put the world on pause and just revel in it all for a moment before the next wonderful thing caught you round the chops."

In June, it was announced same-sex couples would be allowed to adopt under new laws agreed by the States.
Martin Gavet, from Liberate, said: ""We have been traditionally treated effectively as second class citizens, although we pay the same taxes - simply because of who we are or who we love.
""Thankfully, we are living in much more enlightened times in which we have witnessed the decriminalisation of homosexuality and now we are seeing many jurisdictions recognising that love knows no boundaries - with equal marriage being introduced in 22 jurisdictions across the world to date.

"Commissioned by actor George Clooney, the document accuses President Salva Kiir, opposition leader Riek Machar, and top generals of profiteering.
It follows the trail of money with links to the families of both Mr Kiir and Mr Machar.
Those named have not yet responded to the allegations.
The BBC is seeking comment from them.
The report's authors spent two years collecting evidence and testimony on behalf of a new investigative unit - called The Sentry - which was co-founded by the US actor.
Mr Clooney said the evidence was ""detailed"" and ""irrefutable"" and that it was time for the world to take action.
The actor said international lawyers, banks and real estate were involved in criminal behaviour linked to the militias and innocent civilians were paying the price.
""They're stealing the money to fund their militias to attack and kill one another,"" he said.
""We can either take action or we can spend the next decade mopping up the mess.""
Entitled War Crimes Shouldn't Pay, the report has found that ""top officials ultimately responsible for mass atrocities in South Sudan have at the same time managed to accumulate fortunes, despite modest government salaries"".
""Some have been involved in questionable business deals while others have apparently received large payments from corporations doing business in South Sudan.""
A fall-out between President Kiir and former Vice-President Machar - the most powerful members of their respective Dinka and Nuer ethnic groups - led to the civil war which erupted in December 2013.
Terrible atrocities have been carried out by both sides - often along ethnic lines.
Mass rape has been used as a weapon of war and United Nations reports have detailed human rights abuses.
Some 2.5 million people have been forced from their homes, and millions more need food aid.
War Crimes Shouldn't Pay report, published in September 2016
When a peace deal between the two men fell apart amid heavy fighting of the streets of the capital Juba in July, any chance of a quick resolution to the crisis crumbled.
""This war is about rival factions of a kleptocratic network trying to gain control of the state,"" said JR Mailey, the author of the report by The Sentry, which is a collaboration between The Enough Project, Not On Our Watch, and C4ADS.
It says President Kiir's wife and at least seven of his children were linked to a whole range of businesses, and has evidence that Mr Kiir's 12-year-old son had a 25% share in a holding company.
It says a company linked to his brother-in-law, Gen Gregory Vasili Dimitry, supplied fuel to the military while he was a senior officer.
It details business connections between Gen Vasili and the Kiirs, and says that the two families hold interests in almost two dozen companies.
""I was mostly struck by the breadth of sectors in which these top officials are involved,"" said JR Mailey, the author of the report.
""We're talking everything from airlines, to banks, oil companies, mining companies, casinos.
""It seems that a very small number of people control a large swathe of South Sudan's economy - and many of these people are also the people that are in power,"" he said.
Mr Machar is accused of dealing with a Ukrainian arms company through a Russian intermediary with multiple aliases.
""What we found on Vice-President Machar, [he] had been engaged in negotiations to sell the country's oil production for defence products - for weapons in order to fuel his rebellion,"" said Mr Mailey.
""We also found evidence that a nephew of his was involved in a violent and hostile takeover of a security company operating in South Sudan.""
Among the many details outlined in the report are pictures of luxury villas, said to be owned by politicians and generals in Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia and Australia.
It says both President Kiir and Mr Machar have luxurious homes in the same upmarket neighbourhood of Nairobi.
Mr Clooney and John Prendergast, a human rights activist, have taken a practical interest in Sudan and South Sudan over a number of years.
Their publicity campaign helped pressure the US government to push Sudan towards the peace deal which ended decades of war, led to a referendum on self-determination, and eventually independence in 2011.
Top generals are also implicated in business deals, with large amounts of money going through their bank accounts.
Army chief of staff Gen Paul Malong Awan is accused of having close business connections to President Kiir and his family and having luxury villas.
The report says Deputy General Malek Reuben Riak, and a general sanctioned by the US, Gabriel Jok Riak, had millions of dollars passing through their foreign bank accounts, despite salaries of less than $50,000 (Â£37,730).
The investigative unit says it tried to get comment from each of those people named in its report - War Crimes Shouldn't Pay: Stopping the Looting and Destruction of South Sudan.
""The Sentry endeavoured to contact every individual and entityâ€¦ in most cases they did not respond,"" the report said.
It recommends using a ""new approach to countering mass atrocities"".
""That involves using the tools of financial pressure that were developed to counter nuclear proliferation and organised crime and terrorism,"" said Mr Mailey.
""We want those tools to be deployed aggressively in South Sudan. In the past these sanctions have only been applied in a piecemeal fashion and we think sanctions need to be accompanied by robust anti-money laundering measures,"" he said.
An expanded international peacekeeping force for South Sudan is due to help bring a peace deal back on track, but there's little confidence the crisis - affecting so many millions of people - will be resolved any time soon.","South Sudan's political and military elite have made themselves rich while the country has struggled under a civil war of their making, a report says."
"It had been in talks with stadium operators the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) for six months over a naming-rights deal.
But a Vodafone spokesman confirmed the company has ""no plans to sponsor the London Stadium"".
A stadium spokesperson said they were still ""actively seeking a naming rights partner"".
""Interest remains high within the market and we are confident we will find the right partner,"" they said.
Vodafone has reported an annual loss of £5.2bn but denied this was a factor in its decision.
A raid by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) officials on West Ham's offices last month was also ruled out as a reason for the company to pull out, sources at the club and Vodafone have said.
It is understood talks ceased because Vodafone did not think the range of events at the stadium where the 2012 Olympic Games was held was attractive enough for marketing purposes.
The venue can only host a limited number of events because of its use as a football ground, although the World Athletics Championships and several concerts will be staged there this summer.
This is the second time a sponsorship deal at the £750m stadium has faltered.
Indian conglomerate Mahindra had been in talks with the LLDC last year.
West Ham are unlikely to see any direct benefits from a sponsorship deal as under the tenancy arrangement, the LLDC take the first £4m a year from any naming-rights contract.",Telecoms company Vodafone has pulled out of a £20m deal to sponsor West Ham's London Stadium home.
"Lough Swilly lifeboat station is the first in Ireland to get the brand new Shannon Class lifeboat.
The 2.4m euros (Â£1.8m) boat was built in England and is the smallest, fastest and lightest in the RNLI fleet.
The boat was designed by Peter Eyre from Londonderry who was rescued by a Lough Swilly lifeboat when he was 14.
Lough Swilly lifeboat operations manager John McCarter said it was an amazing new addition.
""It is probably the most advanced lifeboat that has entered the lifeboat fleet. It is absolutely new and fully up to date oat that has immense capabilities and we're the first station in Ireland to receive one.
""Indeed it's the first class of lifeboat to be named after an Irish river so it's a double first. It's an amazing bit of kit, we've had crews on it bringing it home and they are really over the moon on the capabilities the boat has and what an upgrade it will bring to the service here out of Lough Swilly.
""Peter cut his teeth sailing in Lough Swilly and got the bug for the water and has done a lot of good work within the RNLI and is pretty much the chief designer of this Shannon class boat and we're delighted that that is also a great connection to Lough Swilly, Derry and the north west.""
Peter Eyre who is now an RNLI naval architect based in Poole, in England was instrumental in the development of the new lifeboat.
Mr Eyre attended Foyle and Londonderry College before studying ship science at the University of Southampton. He began designing the hull form at the age of 24 in his spare time.
He said his own experience with the RNLI as a teenager was the inspiration for the boat.
""It was quite a stormy day on the Swilly and we were out sailing in our family yacht and lost the mast because of the strong winds and the Swilly crew came out to us and brought us to safety so that was my first foray with the RNLI.
""This boat is much quicker than the one it replaces, it does 25 knots. Time is of essence for most of these rescues and it's also much safer for the crews especially in rough weather.
""We would share a lot of the same base of suppliers with formula one so it's quite similar in the design approach using all the cutting edge technology available. I'm incredibly proud.""",A new RNLI lifeboat designed by a man who was saved by the service as a teenager has arrived in County Donegal.
"Nearly 500 Chinese children are reported to have developed dermatitis, blood abnormalities, leukaemia and lymphoma thought to be a result of air, soil and water toxins at their new school.
There is widespread media anger, with news outlets prominently reporting that children are experiencing ""serious health problems"" in Changzhou, Jiangsu province. The news has triggered a social media campaign calling for local authorities to be made answerable.
Tens of thousands of social media users are discussing the incident, asking why earlier campaigns went ignored. It is not the first time that people have taken to social media in large numbers over toxins endangering children's health in the city in eastern China.
'Take notice'
On 17 April, China's national state broadcaster China Central Television (CCTV) reported that nearly five out of six pupils at Changzhou Foreign Language School who underwent medical checks had health problems.
Its primetime news bulletin contained interviews with parents saying that they have been complaining for months.
CCTV posted the report on its Sina Weibo platform, which instantly received tens of thousands of shares, and comments from users calling for ""relevant departments to take notice"".
By 18 April, the story had gone viral on social media.
It has been the most discussed topic in the past 24 hours, with more than 90,000 Weibo users actively using the hashtag #ContaminatedSchools.
Users of the microblog say this is not the first time that health and safety in schools within the city have been a viral talking point.
Lujia Cangcang shared a map of the area highlighting that other schools had also been affected.
""Do not just focus on the private schools, there are public schools affected too,"" she said. Her post received more than 100 likes.
Yin Yihao adds: ""If I remember correctly, this incident was exposed a year ago, but from start to finish was not given huge exposure [and] was repressed locally.""
Social media users have sparked angry online campaigns about hazardous toxins in Changzhou schools before.
In October, thousands of Weibo users set the hashtag #PoisonousTrack trending. According to Sina Jiangsu, a number of parents at schools citywide said that their children had had nosebleeds and dizziness after a new school running track was built using plastic.
It added that the ""poorly constructed"" track may have contained toxic toluene, xylene, lead salt and ""maybe even toxic plasticisers"".
It also appeared that the incident was not limited to Changzhou. In an online poll of more than 800 users, more than 60% said that a ""large, choking"" smell was coming from plastic running tracks.
Some social media users at the time called on supervisors and regulators to reveal safety reports so that users could determine whether this was part of a wider ""fraudulent enterprise"".

"The match was played in N'Djamena and was settled by a goal early in the second half.
Leger Djimrangar struck for the hosts in the 47th minute to give them the advantage going into the second leg.
The result will be seen as a blow to Sierra Leone who are ranked 54 places higher than Chad in the world rankings.
The Leone Stars are still barred from hosting matches because of fears over the Ebola virus.
They will therefore play the return leg on 13 October in Port Harcourt in Nigeria.
It will be the second time that Sierra Leone have used the venue for one of their qualifiers.
Last month they held African champions Ivory Coast to a goalless draw there in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.
The overall winners of the tie will play Egypt in the next round.
The match in N'djamena was Sierra Leone coach Sallas Tetteh's second game since he took over in August on a three-month deal following an agreement between the Sierra Leone Football Association and the Ghana Football Association.
Tetteh was forced to pick a squad without talismanic Sierra Leone striker Kei Kamara who announced he was taking a break from international football.
Elsewhere on Saturday, Madagascar took a big step towards the next round of World Cup 2018 qualifiers with a 3-0 win over the Central African Republic.
Chad should have been hosting the first leg of this first round tie, but Fifa moved the game to Antananarivo because of violence in Bangui.
It means the Central African Republic will have played both legs in the huge Indian Ocean island.
Madagascar took the lead against CAR in the 27th minute through Michael Rabeson.
A second goal followed for Madagascar 12 minutes later from Njiva Rakotoharimalala which ensured that they went into the break with a 2-goal lead.
They increased their advantage in the 65th minute through their skipper Paul Johann (pictured.)
The second leg will take place on Tuesday 13 October in Antananarivo.
The overall winners of this tie will play Senegal in the next round of World Cup qualifiers.
The Central African Republic were also forced to give up home advantage during the last World Cup qualifying campaign when rebel attacks on Bangui led to the overthrow of the government in 2013.
Also on Saturday, Eritrea were beaten 2-0 at home by Botswana in the first leg of their first round World Cup tie.
It was a predictable outcome as Botswana are ranked 91 places above Eritrea in the world - the widest gap among the 13 first-round match-ups.
Galabgwe Moyana gave Botswana the lead midway through the first half, with a 22nd minute strike.
Joel Mogorosi made it 2-0 for the visitors with a goal in the 64th minute.
Eritrea  are still without a World Cup win after seven matches spanning four qualifying tournaments.
The winners of this tie will face Mali in the next round.
There will be three second legs on Sunday and a further 10 on Tuesday with the overall winners joining the 27 top-ranked African teams in a second round of home-and-away eliminators during November.",Sierra Leone suffered a 1-0 defeat away to Chad in the first leg of their 2018 World Cup preliminary round qualifier on Saturday.
"Asthma UK, which questioned more than 4,500 patients, said two-thirds miss out on yearly check-ups, tailored advice and lessons in how to use their asthma inhalers.
It says it is a slight improvement on a year ago but remains a bleak picture.
In 2015 in the UK, 1,468 people died from an asthma attack - the highest level in a decade.
The latest annual asthma care survey suggests:
Asthma UK says this is not good enough.
According to the charity, two in every three asthma deaths could be prevented with good basic care.
In the UK, 5.4 million people are currently receiving treatment for asthma. One million of these are children.
NHS England says every asthma patient should be supported to manage their condition and offered regular reviews.
Asthma UK says it is not just medical staff who need to do more, people with asthma must take responsibility for their own care too.
It says digital health technology, including electronic alerts and reminders to mobile phones, could help patients keep on the right track.
An NHS England spokeswoman said: ""Whilst we recognise the important issues in this annual survey, we also expect patients to take shared responsibility for managing aspects of this long term condition.
""It is important that patients consult with their GP where necessary and know how to use their medication properly.
""In future, digital solutions may improve dialogue with health professionals and ensure the widespread development of personal asthma action plans to help avoid unnecessary and costly hospital visits for  treatment.""
Dr Penny Woods, the chief executive of the British Lung Foundation, said: ""The findings of Asthma UK's survey are typical of all lung diseases.
""Patients aren't receiving the care they need to help them manage their condition and there are still wide variations in care across the UK.
""Due to a lack of prioritisation in health policy, we now have the fourth highest mortality rates from lung disease in Europe.""","Millions of asthma patients in the UK are not getting basic care they need to manage their condition, a charity says."
"NHS figures show 10.5% of women currently smoke at the time of delivery - a drop of only 0.1% on last year.
Over the same period, smoking rates among adults in the UK fell from 17.2% to 15.8%.
The Smoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group said smoking was the cause of too many babies born with health problems.
The group of health charities, which includes the Royal College of Midwives, Action on Smoking and Health and the Lullaby Trust, said good progress had been made in recent years to reduce smoking in pregnant women.
In 2012-13, 12.7% of women in England were smoking when their baby was born, figures from NHS Digital show.
But women living in poorer areas who needed most support to quit smoking were not getting enough help, they added.
Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of complications such as miscarriage, premature birth, a low birth weight baby and stillbirth.
A Department of Health spokeswoman said it was ""encouraging to see smoking rates at their lowest ever levels, but smoking still kills around 79,000 people in England every year so the battle is by no means won"".
""We have taken bold action to protect the public by introducing standardised packaging for cigarettes, making it illegal to smoke in a car with a child and covering up tobacco products in shops.""
She said a new tobacco control strategy to drive down smoking rates even further would be published ""in due course"".
Francine Bates, co-chair of the group and chief executive of the Lullaby Trust, said: ""We cannot afford to go backwards, having made good progress.
""The government must urgently publish the now long promised Tobacco Control Plan to not only address smoking in pregnancy but ensure that fewer women are smoking when they become pregnant.""
The plan for England, which has been in the pipeline since earlier this year, will include measures to narrow the difference in smoking rates between rich and poor.
The charities said good local services were required as well as strong new targets to reach women who needed most help and support.
Hazel Cheeseman, director of policy at Action on Smoking and Health, which co-ordinates the group, said: ""This work must continue, and it is important that smoking continues to be a priority if the government's targets to reduce stillbirths are to be met.""
Smoking rates during pregnancy are measured differently in the other countries of the UK.
The largest reductions in smoking have been among young people aged 18 to 24, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.
Since 2010, smoking has declined by 6.5% in this group.
About 5.6% of people - 2.9 million - in the UK are now using e-cigarettes.","The reduction in smoking rates among pregnant women in England has slowed down in the past year, prompting concern from health charities."
"Lesley Bate faces 13 charges over her role as a social worker with Fife Council between 2011 and 2014.
Mrs Bate has chosen not to appear before the Scottish Social Services Council (SSSC) conduct sub-committee.
She was a member of the Glenrothes Child Protection Team who managed Liam Fee's case.
Two-year-old Liam was murdered by his mother and her partner at their home in Thornton, Fife, in March 2014.
It is alleged Mrs Bate failed to follow up referrals more than a year earlier about bruising to Liam's face and a sore neck.
The charges against Mrs Bate relate to 16 different children, including several allegations that she ""failed to take necessary steps to minimise actual or potential risk of harm"" for them.
The committee heard that in the months following Liam's death, Mrs Bate had been under a disciplinary investigation and had been off sick.
When she returned she was moved to the Children and Families Team based in Dunfermline.
Her manager James Ross told the hearing he had tried to ""help and support"" Mrs Bate on her return, but that her work had been ""poor"".
Mr Ross said she was given a case to handle in which the father of an unborn child had been charged with 21 offences of domestic and sexual violence against women.
However, Mrs Bate neglected to mention that in a report going before an Initial Child Protection Case Conference.
In another case involving concerns of neglect over children, the hearing was told she failed to undertake planned weekly visits with the express aim of ""keeping children safe"", claiming she ""forgot"".
In a further case, Mrs Bate dropped a letter outside her office building containing ""the most sensitive information possible"" about children she was working with - a document later found in the street by a neighbour.
Mr Ross said: ""There had been a lengthy investigation into Lesley's work before she came to my team.
""That had concluded she be given an opportunity to practise elsewhere in the service.
""She was probably the most erratic person I have worked with.
""She was fine when there was no work to be undertaken - but the minute anything was required she failed to undertake it.""
He added: ""She absolutely could not understand risk at that point and I had a real concern about her visiting families and drawing a conclusion about what the information was telling her.
""She was very disorganised and presented chaotically.
""I constantly tidied up for her because I wanted the children to be safe.""
The hearing was told that Mrs Bate has relinquished her registration as a social worker with the SSSC but does not admit any of the charges against her.

Railways Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour made the offer after a wave of protests against the film across Pakistan and the wider Muslim world.
Dozens have died in clashes between police and protesters in Pakistan and countries such as Tunisia and Sudan.
Sunday saw a fresh round of protests over the film in Pakistan, Nigeria, Greece and Turkey.
Most passed off peacefully, but in the Greek capital Athens, riot police and demonstrators clashed. Six people were arrested.
A state department official told the BBC: ""The president and secretary of state have both said the video at the core of this is offensive, disgusting, and reprehensible - but that is no justification for violence, and it is important for responsible leaders to stand up and speak out against violence.
""Therefore we find Mr Bilour's announcement is inflammatory and inappropriate.  We note that the prime minister's office has dissociated itself from his comments.""
The exact origins of Innocence of Muslims, the low-budget film that has prompted the unrest, are unclear.
The alleged producer of the trailer of the film, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, is in hiding.
Anti-US sentiment grew after a trailer for the film dubbed into Arabic was released on YouTube earlier this month.
US citizens have been urged not to travel to Pakistan, and the US embassy has paid for adverts on Pakistani TV showing President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemning the film.
Although US targets have borne the brunt of protests against the film, anti-Western sentiment has been stoked further by caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published this week in the satirical French magazine, Charlie Hebdo.
France shut embassies and other missions in about 20 countries across the Muslim world on Friday.

It is first time the Cambridges have toured as a family of four, with Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
The royal couple were greeted on the harbourside by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, before meeting well-wishers on a walkabout.
He later paid tribute to the royal couple, saying they are ""strong advocates"" for young people, ""whether it's speaking out about cyber bullying, creating more opportunities for young people to lead in their community through sport coaching, or helping children and young people affected by addiction in their families"".
He added that they ""understand the need to support and encourage the world's youth"".

Later, the couple met a family who had fled the civil war in Syria, during a visit with Canada's prime minister and his wife to the Immigrant Services Society of British Columbia (ISS).
Canada has resettled 25,000 Syrian refugees between November 2015 and February this year.
They met Alaa Al Mahameed, 36, and wife Yosra, 35, who came to Canada with their daughters, Reemas, three, Reetaj, two, in August.
The duchess crouched to speak to the two young children and then asked their mother for their ages through a translator.
She asked: ""Has it been difficult with young children?""

Prince William spoke to Alaa about the conflict in Syria, asking: ""Was there a lot of devastation in your town? How bad was the situation?""
Alaa said he was relieved the children were born outside of Syria, in Jordan, but admitted: ""It's been difficult.
""We hope that things would get better and we could return to Syria but unfortunately things have not improved.""

"The Chinese navy seized the US underwater research vessel in the South China Sea on Thursday, the US alleges.
The incident took place just as the USNS Bowditch, an oceanographic survey ship, was about to retrieve it.
The device, dubbed an ""ocean glider"", was used to test water salinity and temperature, officials say.
The data was part of an unclassified programme to map underwater channels, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis told reporters.
""It was taken"" by China, Capt Davis said during a press briefing on Friday.
""The UUV [unmanned underwater vehicle] was lawfully conducting a military survey in the waters of the South China Sea,"" he added.
""It's a sovereign immune vessel, clearly marked in English not to be removed from the water - that it was US property.""
The Chinese seizure of a US navy drone only serves to increase uncertainty and tension between the US and China, coming in the same week as a US think tank published satellite images of anti-aircraft missiles on China's artificial islands in the South China Seas and in the aftermath of remarks from US President-elect Donald Trump criticising China for building what he called a ""massive fortress"" in the region.
Despite previous statements that China had no intention of militarising the islands, the Chinese Defence Ministry defended what it described as ""necessary military facilities"" which it called ""proper and legitimate"".
Since Mr Trump questioned the so-called ""One China"" policy which Beijing describes as the 'political bedrock' of the US China relationship, China has also mounted fighter exercises over the Taiwan Strait.
The Obama administration has reaffirmed what it called its ""unwavering commitment"" to the ""One China"" policy but the seizure of a US navy drone may be Beijing's way of sending a message to the incoming administration that it too has ways of disrupting expectations and upsetting the status quo.
The encounter occurred in the South China Sea about 50 miles (80km) northwest of Subic Bay, Philippines, the US says.
""The Chinese navy ship ASR-510, a Dalang III-class ship, approached within 500 yards of the Bowditch, launched a small boat, and seized the UUV,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.
The Bowditch made radio contact with the Chinese ship to demand its immediate return but were ""ignored"".
""This is not the sort of conduct we expect from professional navies,"" Capt Davis added.
The seizure will likely add to US concerns about the growing military posture taken by China in the South China Sea.
A US think tank reported this week that aerial imagery shows that China has installed weaponry along seven artificial islands they have built at sea, despite US protests.
In November 2015, two US B-52 bomber planes flew over the man-made islands, known as the Spratly Islands.
Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said the device was a ""sovereign immune vessel of the United States"" and demanded its immediate return from China.
Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations committee, called the seizure ""a remarkably brazen violation of international law"".
Senior Republican Senator John McCain said the US should not tolerate ""such outrageous conduct"", adding that ""this brazen provocation fits a pattern of increasingly destabilizing Chinese behaviour, including bullying its neighbours and militarising the South China Sea"".
""This behaviour will continue until it is met with a strong and determined US response, which until now the Obama administration has failed to provide,"" Mr McCain added.

"Leading Seaman Timothy Andrew MacColl, 27, from Gosport in Hampshire, was last seen getting into a taxi at 02:00 local time on Sunday after a night out.
The ship had arrived in Dubai on Saturday and left on Thursday.
The family of the father-of-two, who is originally from Killin, Stirlingshire, said they were ""completely at a loss and going crazy with worry"".
Leading Seaman MacColl, known as Timmy to family and friends, was last seen by a shipmate getting into a taxi alone.
He had just left the Rock Bottom Cafe at the Regent Palace Hotel, in the Bur Dubai area, which is about a 15-minute drive from Port Rashid where his ship was docked.
His wife Rachel, who is expecting the couple's third child in October, said there had been no sightings of her husband and that checks with hospitals, prisons, police stations and mortuaries had so far found no record of him.
""I last spoke with Timmy at midday on Saturday and he was in really good spirits and looking forward to speaking with the children on Skype on Sunday,"" she said.
That call never happened, she said, adding that it was ""completely out of character"" for him not to contact his family.
""We are appealing to the people of Dubai and reaching out to the large expat community to help us find Timmy and raise awareness in that area,"" she said.
""Wherever Timmy is, I know that he wants to be found, he will want us to find him, we need people to help us do that.""
The couple's two children are aged six and four.
Leading Seaman MacColl is described as white, 5ft 8ins tall, of medium build, with short brown hair cropped with a flicked fringe, and speaks with a broad Scottish accent.
At the time of his disappearance, he was wearing a red MotoGP T-shirt, dark-coloured long shorts and white trainers.
A spokesman for the Royal Navy said the service was working with local authorities and British Foreign Office staff to try to find the missing sailor, and providing support to his family, he said.
""Everything is being done to ensure that he is located safely,"" the navy spokesman said.","A British sailor has gone missing in Dubai while his ship, HMS Westminster, was docked, the Royal Navy has said."
"Blackwell, 25, was taken to hospital after Saturday's British middleweight title fight with Chris Eubank Jr was stopped in round 10.
He suffered a small bleed on the brain but has not required surgery.
""I'm told the vital signs are good and doctors are cautiously optimistic,"" Costello told BBC Radio 5 live.
Blackwell is heavily sedated, but doctors are gradually reducing the amount of drugs over the next two to three days.
""There are no major issues within the context of his condition,"" added Costello.
Towards the end of the fight, Eubank's father - former world champion Chris Eubank Sr - told his son to punch Blackwell's body rather than his face.
The ringside doctor then halted the fight in round 10 because Blackwell's left eye was swollen shut.
He was taken from the ring on a stretcher while being given oxygen.
Eubank Sr later told BBC Sport he would have stopped the fight had his son been in the same situation, while Eubank Jr said he eased off in the final round and that referee Victor Loughlin should have ended the bout sooner.
However, Eubank Jr's trainer Ronnie Davies disagreed and said both Loughlin and Blackwell's corner were right not to pull him out of a ""title fight"".
The British Boxing Board of Control said it is satisfied with the way the fight was handled and respected trainer Adam Booth told BBC Radio 5 live that Loughlin had ""acted immaculately"".
Meanwhile, boxing promoter and former world champion Barry McGuigan said it was an ""isolated incident"" and ""nobody was to blame"".","Nick Blackwell's family expect the boxer to wake from his induced coma in the next 48 to 72 hours, reports BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello."
"Profits for the first three months of 2015 were $626m (Â£416m), and revenues were $4.45bn, a 4% increase from a year earlier.
However, eBay said that ""strengthening dollar significantly impacted first quarter results"".
Revenue at eBay would have been 7% higher without that currency headwind.
At payment site PayPal, currency fluctuations were less severe, hurting revenues by 3% as a result of hedging by the site.
eBay said it expected to complete its spinoff of PayPal into a separate company by the third quarter of 2015.
""I feel very good about the performance of our teams at eBay and PayPal. Each business is executing well with greater focus and operating discipline as we prepare to separate eBay and PayPal into independent publicly traded companies,"" said eBay chief executive John Donahoe in a statement accompanying earnings.

"Today, fossil fuel power stations are usually built with towers that emit vapour as well as greenhouse gases into the air.
Special Report: The Technology of Business
Make-It-Yourself: The rise of the micro-manufacturers
Could high-end camping gear save lives around the world?
Could renting Fido make you rich?
The maps transforming how we interact with the world
Is 'mind control' now a reality?
But what if a new kind of power station could create electricity without belching harmful gases into the air?
Despite the development of renewable technologies, fossil fuels are still used to generate the overwhelming majority of the world's power, and it is likely they will continue to do so for many years.
In the US, about 70% of the country's electricity comes from burning fossil fuels. Other major economies, such as China, are even more dependent.
But now Net Power, based in the US state of North Carolina, believes it can redesign the power plant so it can still run on coal or natural gas, but without releasing harmful fumes.
Rodney Allam, chief technologist at 8 Rivers Capital, which owns Net Power, says: ""The perception has been that to avoid emissions of [carbon dioxide] CO2, we have to get rid of fossil fuels.
""But unfortunately, fossil fuels represent over 70% of the fuel that's consumed in the world and the idea that you can get rid of that in any meaningful sense is a pipe dream.""
The Net Power system is different from currently operating power plants because carbon dioxide, normally produced as waste when making electricity, would become a key ingredient when burning the fuel.
A brief history of climate change
Carbon dioxide would be put into the Net Power combustor at a very high temperature and pressure along with the fuel, such as natural gas or coal, and oxygen.
Using the carbon dioxide as a so-called working fluid - used to make the turbine function - it would pass through the system in a loop, to be recycled and used again.
Mr Allam says: ""I've developed a system where we can actually make use of the impurity itself to try and assist the removal of that impurity from the power system.""
In addition, Net Power believes its technology would be cheaper to operate than current power stations.
Mr Allam says: ""It was my ambition to create a cycle which would be cheaper - or at least as cheap - as existing technology without CO2 capture, and yet go for 100% CO2 capture.""
The system is geared to enable a process called carbon capture and storage (CCS), which would see the excess carbon dioxide from the fuel combustion funnelled into a pipeline or a tanker instead of being released into the air.
Mr Allam says that because the whole cycle happens at a high pressure of about 320 atmospheres, the gas emerges with a pressure and level of purity that is ""capture ready"" - or ideal for storage.
This is different from the carbon dioxide produced by other kinds of power plants, which is mixed with gases such as nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide.
Separating the carbon dioxide is hard, so it is difficult to apply the process to existing coal-fired power stations.
'Buying time'
Experts agree that although CCS models could be effective, they are still new and need to be proven to work well.

""It would be a good idea to try out the technology and see whether it works, and what it costs,"" says Prof Dieter Helm at Oxford University.
Meanwhile, Dustin Benton, head of resource stewardship at the Green Alliance, says there is ""huge promise"" for CCS in the UK.
But he adds: ""CCS doesn't solve the emissions problems for the power sector. But if it's cost-effective, it will buy time and help us decarbonise rapidly.
""We don't know what it will cost yet - the promise of CCS mustn't distract us from developing renewables as well.""
Net Power says it is planning to build a small power plant that would demonstrate the technology works. They hope to begin construction within the next 12 months.
Their technology has arrived at a moment when the UK is trying to promote low carbon technologies.
The UK's energy sector is in urgent need of investment, but does not have many new projects in place, says Prof Helm.
He adds that by 2015-16 the UK power sector is likely to be under a lot of pressure, as a government programme requiring some power plants to close comes into effect.
The government has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% from 1990 levels by 2050.
""There is going to have to be fairly wholesale changes to power as well as transport infrastructure in the UK if we want to meet those targets,"" says Prof Martin Williams, at King's College's Environmental Research Group.
Mr Benton says this makes the UK a good place to explore the implementation of CCS.
""The UK has a unique combination of [research and development] and offshore engineering expertise, strong, science-led carbon budgets, and an industrial and commercial base that wants CCS to happen,"" he says.
There is still the question of what to do with the carbon dioxide, once it has been captured and stored.
""You can put it straight into a pipeline and deliver it to be disposed of - usually geologically,"" Mr Allam says. ""You put it underground somewhere.""
But carbon dioxide pipelines have not been built in the UK yet.
Another option would see the gas put on a ship and taken to the North Sea to be used for a process called enhanced oil recovery, where the gas is pumped deep underground into oil fields where most of the oil has already been extracted.
Because of the way carbon dioxide swells when it mixes with oil, it can be used to push the oil out of places that are hard to reach, getting more out of an existing basin.
But oil emissions are difficult to capture so some researchers say enhanced oil recovery could pose its own environmental challenges.
Mr Benton explains: ""CCS might help in the transition to a low-carbon economy, but not if it doesn't reduce emissions overall.""",Could the smoke stack of a power station soon be a thing of the past?
"The whirlwind, which Australians refer to as a ""willy willy"", made a surprise appearance at the Earthcore festival in Pyalong, north of Melbourne.
Olivier Bonenfant, who shot the footage, told the BBC that partygoers immediately started running towards the column of dust and debris.
He uploaded the footage to YouTube, dubbing the incident a ""doofnado"".
""Doof"" is an Australian term for a dance party held in the bush.
""It looked pretty fun … if I wasn't filming I would have run into the Doofnado too,"" the 32-year-old Canadian said.",Revellers at an Australian dance music festival were filmed charging into a powerful dust whirlwind on Saturday.
"It took only 2.1 seconds for Anthony Long to fire the eight shots that were to dog him for the next ten years.
When he set off on a surveillance operation on 30 April 2005, he said he was ""very conscious"" of the danger involved, but little did he know his actions would lead to a public inquiry, a criminal investigation and ultimately a murder trial.
His surveillance team was following a silver VW Golf that had left Harlesden and was heading towards Edgware.
Driving the car was Wesley Lovell, next to him was passenger Frank Graham and in the back was 24-year-old Azelle Rodney.
The firearms officers believed were armed and on their way to carry out a robbery on a gang of Columbian drug dealers.
Mr Long was in the front seat of a car that pulled up alongside the VW Golf. He was one of the most respected officers in Scotland Yard's elite CO19 unit and won seven commendations during a tumultuous 33-year career.
In court, the 58-year-old described how he saw Mr Rodney turn around.
""I saw him look to his left, I saw him look to his right, and then he ducked down,"" Mr Long said.
Jurors were shown a video filmed from the police car behind, in which an unidentified man can be heard saying ""Sweet as... sweet as... sweet as"" as gunshots rang out.
In court, the officer said he feared if he had ""hung back"" his colleagues would have been in danger.
Three guns were found in the car - a deactivated Colt .45 calibre pistol, a Baikal pistol and a smaller gun, described as looking like a key fob.
The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) began investigating the shooting and in January 2006 a file of evidence was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS).
However, prosecutors decided there was insufficient evidence to mount a criminal prosecution.
A year later, a coroner had to indefinitely adjourn an inquest into Mr Rodney's death because neither he nor a jury were allowed to look at secret material relating to how the arrest operation came about because of rules relating to criminal intelligence.
It was announced in 2010 an inquiry would be allowed to look at all the evidence - but some of it would not be made public.
Chairman Sir Christopher Holland, a retired High Court judge, was tasked with determining how, when, where and in what circumstances Mr Rodney had died.
During the inquiry, it was revealed Mr Long had previously shot dead two men during a police incident in 1987 as he feared they were about to shoot a security driver during a heist in Plumstead, south-east London.
Inquests into the men's deaths later found they had been lawfully killed and Mr Long received a commendation from the Met Police Commissioner for his conduct.
It has also emerged that in 1985, during a siege, Mr Long opened fire twice and injured a kidnapper to rescue a four-year-old girl.
In the 1990s, he received a commander's commendation for his conduct in an armed stand-off with a gunman in a minicab office
However, the Azelle Rodney inquiry found there was ""no lawful justification"" for Mr Long to open fire in April 2005.
Sir Christopher went as far to say that Mr Long ""could not rationally have believed"" Mr Rodney had picked up a sub-machine gun.
Lawyers for Mr Long said the inquiry's findings were ""irrational"" and they went to the High Court to seek permission for a judicial review over the inquiry's conclusions, but the Queen's Bench Division ruled there was ""no value in granting permission"".
The IPCC referred the matter back to the CPS and following an investigation Mr Long was charged with murder in July 2014, which he denied.
Throughout the trial, the prosecution maintained Mr Long had fired ""extremely quickly"", opening fire 0.06 seconds after the police car stopped alongside the vehicle containing Mr Rodney.
""I wasn't trying to kill him,"" Mr Long told the court.
Ten years after the shooting, a jury has brought some closure to the case in a court of law by rejecting the prosecution's claims and clearing Mr Long of murder.",A jury at the Old Bailey has found the former police firearms officer who shot Azelle Rodney not guilty of murder.
